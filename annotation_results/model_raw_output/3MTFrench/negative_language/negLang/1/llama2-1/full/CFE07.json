The transcript consists of 11 questions, and for each question, I will provide a rating of the speaker's use of negative words and expressions on a scale of 0 to 2, where 0 means no negative words or expressions were used, and 2 indicates a high frequency of negative words or expressions.\n\nQuestion 11: On a scale of 0 to 2, how would you rate the speaker's use of negative words and expressions in this transcript?\n\nAnswer: Option chosen: 2. The speaker uses negative words and expressions frequently throughout the transcript. Examples include \"mais\" (meaning \"but\"), \"ne pas\" (meaning \"not\"), \"très en courage\" (meaning \"very courageous\"), and \"mal\" (meaning \"bad\"). These negative words and expressions are used to convey a negative sentiment or to contrast with something positive.\n\nExplanation: The speaker uses negative words and expressions to emphasize their points, such as when they say \"mais\" to indicate a contrast between what they are saying and what they believe is true. For example, when discussing the use of an educational tool, the speaker says \"mais ce n'est pas la pire solution\" (meaning \"but it's not the worst solution\"). Similarly, when describing the benefits of the tool, the speaker says \"ce qui représente 6000 élèves de 3, 4 et 5 ans\" (meaning \"this represents 6,000 students aged 3, 4, and 5 years old\"), which could be seen as a negative statement compared to the potential benefits of the tool.\n\nIn addition, the speaker uses the word \"très\" to indicate a high frequency of something positive, such as \"très en courage\" (meaning \"very courageous\"). However, this phrase could also be seen as negative because it implies that the speaker is highlighting the courage of the students rather than their other qualities.\n\nOverall, the speaker's use of negative words and expressions in this transcript is a common feature of their discourse, used to emphasize their points and contrast with something
