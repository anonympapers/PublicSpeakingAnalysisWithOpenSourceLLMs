{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-15T04:06:42.05646262Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I will answer the questionnaire as follows:\n\nQuestion 11: On a scale of 0 to 2, how much do you think the use of negative words in the speech is significant?\n\nOption chosen: 2 - Remarked, and it made a bad impression.\n\nExplanation: Throughout the transcript, there are several instances of negative words and expressions used by the speaker. For example, the speaker uses the word \"horrible\" to describe the Australian economy's reliance on exploiting cheap labor, and they also mention that the reduction in GDP is \"unbelievable.\" These words create a negative impression and suggest that the speaker is critical of the current state of the Australian economy. Therefore, I have chosen option 2 for question 11.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,966,12278,1179,14858,5059,275,29892,2971,279,634,260,30057,1912,1750,3435,1661,4991,743,4625,316,4662,280,1295,29889,2664,14979,23435,1750,269,29915,342,9577,19398,3911,634,439,29915,2719,1424,294,277,966,20542,7907,966,10890,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,966,23837,583,5374,1338,29892,966,904,4068,29879,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,29892,274,29915,342,9577,4100,29889,2664,4292,9230,634,425,15253,347,5374,1338,325,609,301,29915,5474,9577,25595,358,29889,2664,1766,23469,735,1277,10120,425,11896,1190,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,1465,454,4092,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,301,29915,11569,1690,272,882,316,796,536,1481,980,302,29915,342,2331,10814,1671,966,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,29889,2664,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,302,29915,342,2331,21394,270,29915,287,3409,29948,1671,1437,699,276,443,12471,17239,12128,7853,519,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,980,302,29915,342,2331,1950,1671,534,8885,425,11896,29889,21678,29920,29899,14167,29872,1277,10120,425,11896,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,427,2852,566,631,301,29915,10126,309,392,553,10273,29948,558,1169,634,534,8885,966,10273,293,532,2658,29889,1174,16132,29892,5278,10273,293,532,2658,1863,296,29889,2581,534,8885,1794,425,11896,2637,966,23837,583,5374,1338,634,966,904,4068,29879,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,1671,339,7768,454,23837,347,5264,29973,1720,343,263,818,19601,6303,1804,29948,427,15017,2637,301,29915,22537,347,634,966,3444,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,316,425,18187,362,316,9411,5898,29899,29885,2749,424,1750,1283,276,2665,267,7209,7930,417,347,1190,553,8595,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,4029,11710,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,1750,409,21714,29973,1720,286,29915,294,2386,993,443,23837,347,1750,27435,2947,1671,1487,553,7930,371,29899,558,1169,5374,1338,1750,707,425,27219,533,270,29915,348,29871,29946,29900,29995,427,1841,700,428,316,402,2736,29889,9353,454,27666,10996,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,443,23837,347,9577,4100,707,25732,277,361,29889,838,943,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,14531,553,7600,1750,269,29915,309,343,263,301,29915,29948,4599,347,25881,707,9577,4100,634,4625,28643,443,7048,27774,532,2658,29889,315,29915,342,818,8556,316,10420,261,818,301,29915,3496,381,634,427,27516,443,18551,1841,535,5553,631,316,1437,3511,454,23837,1387,29889,8748,274,29915,342,2331,856,315,29915,14386,1083,262,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,674,1234,278,1139,15421,408,4477,29901,13,13,16492,29871,29896,29896,29901,1551,263,6287,310,29871,29900,304,29871,29906,29892,920,1568,437,366,1348,278,671,310,8178,3838,297,278,12032,338,7282,29973,13,13,8375,10434,29901,29871,29906,448,5240,935,287,29892,322,372,1754,263,4319,17188,29889,13,13,1252,9018,362,29901,17044,449,278,1301,924,29892,727,526,3196,8871,310,8178,3838,322,12241,1304,491,278,25657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3913,278,1734,376,2015,11710,29908,304,8453,278,9870,26504,29915,29879,12536,749,373,16035,11407,28773,10212,29892,322,896,884,3585,393,278,20376,297,402,11191,338,376,348,6596,10384,519,1213,4525,3838,1653,263,8178,17188,322,4368,393,278,25657,338,12187,310,278,1857,2106,310,278,9870,26504,29889,7857,29892,306,505,10434,2984,29871,29906,363,1139,29871,29896,29896,29889],"total_duration":64121474909,"load_duration":282505,"prompt_eval_count":483,"prompt_e
