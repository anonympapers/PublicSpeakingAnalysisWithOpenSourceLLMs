{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-15T04:16:20.951053728Z","response":"\nFor this analysis task, I will be analyzing the transcript provided in the questionnaire and evaluating the use of negative words and expressions in the speech. The transcript is as follows:\n\n\"Avez-vous la s'engager ? Non, mais c'est pour bientôt. Pour nos routes, c'est pareil. Nous sommes déjà passés des sentiers. Au voir au même, puis aux enrobts bébicumineux, pour arriver au programme moderne sur les autôtes. Bien tôt, grâce au travau d'ingénieur, de chercheurs et de doctores like me. We roll on the roads of 5th generation. The R-5G. It's intelligent and even depolluting. Going for a view, no difference with other roads. But in reality, there are nanophiles, zinc oxide present on the surface. Zinc oxide, but why ? Simply because it is non-toxic, biocompatible and settles in the form of nanophiles and respectful of the environment. Additionally, it will be able to depollute the air and water through photocatalysis. Photocatalysis is a very simple process. During the day, our material will absorb light, generate hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radicals are like Batman of the depollution stage, attacking graded pollutants, transformed into harmless molecules already present in nature, such as carbon dioxide and water. But at night, unlike the sun, pollution is not spared, and neither will our super material. It will capture the pollutant until morning, when it will be combined with the first rays of sunlight, transforming it into harmless molecules. That's the theory, but in practice, is it that simple ? Indeed, it's like cooking a recipe and mastering it. It's not always easy. You must understand the subtleties at times, even modify the recipe or change the cooking method. For five, or five people, it's not the same thing. You need the material, equality, and sometimes modify the cooking time or change the recipe. For my thesis, it's not that either. Currently, I'm in second year. At a small scale, I have synthesized nanophyllia on concrete and cement. I have even proven their efficiency to depollute the air and water. Without bad genes, there remains a long road before this reaches your home. However, when you have it, I hope you'll remember that all of this is possible. With radicals from Roxyl, alias Batman, and his sidekick Leana Nofil, I hope we can say that we stayed on the right track, all day long, without seeing pollution accumulate.\"\n\nFor this transcript, I will evaluate the use of negative words and expressions as follows:\n\n1. The word \"non\" is used twice in the transcript, both in the context of \"Avez-vous la s'engager ? Non, mais c'est pour bientôt.\" and \"Nous sommes déjà passés des sentiers.\" These are examples of negative words used to convey a lack of engagement or a previous passage.\n2. The phrase \"pareil\" is used once in the transcript, in the context of \"Pour nos routes, c'est pareil.\" This phrase is used to indicate that the speaker believes the roads they are referring to are similar in some way.\n3. The word \"mais\" is used twice in the transcript, both in the context of \"Mais en réalité,\" and \"Mais contre les nanophiles, zinc oxide present on the surface.\" This word is used to indicate a contrast or difference between two things.\n4. The phrase \"aucune différence avec les autres routes\" is used once in the transcript, in the context of \"Going for a view, no difference with other roads.\" This phrase is used to indicate that the speaker believes there is no difference between the roads they are referring to and other roads.\n5. The word \"pollution\" is used three times in the transcript, twice as a noun and once as a verb. This word is used to refer to the substances or substance that needs to be depolluted.\n6. The phrase \"sans voir la pollution s'acumuler\" is used once in the transcript, in the context of \"But at night, unlike the sun, pollution is not spared, and neither will our super material.\" This phrase is used to indicate that the speaker believes pollution will continue to accumulate if left unchecked.\n\nBased on these evaluations, I would give the transcript a score of 3 out of 5 for the use of negative words and expressions. The transcript does contain some negative words and phrases, such as \"non,\" \"mais,\" and \"aucune différence,\" but they are used in a way that is clear and understandable to the listener. Additionally, the transcript conveys a sense of urgency and importance regarding the depollution of roads, which could be further emphasized through the use of even more negative words or
