{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-15T03:17:16.44520195Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I will answer the questionnaire as follows:\n\nQuestion 11: On a scale of 0 to 2, how much do you think negative words/expressions are used in the speech?\n\nOption choosed: 2 - Remarked, and it had a negative impression.\n\nExplanation: Throughout the transcript, there are several instances of negative words/expressions used by the speaker. For example, the speaker uses the word \"impossible\" to describe something that cannot be done (e.g., \"Pour répondre à ce type de question, j'ai été bien protococcientifique.\"). The speaker also uses the phrase \"magic word\" to refer to a term that is not explicitly stated (e.g., \"Le résultat, un modèle qui met la relation au coeur des organisations. Ce modèle pourrait révolutionner notre façon de conserver l'obisiness car il permet de démultiplier les opportunités.\"). These instances give a negative impression and suggest that the speaker is being overly optimistic or exaggerating the potential of their model.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,818,9411,29892,7890,29871,22730,966,6079,854,375,29889,20894,2353,29920,29899,4346,29875,316,7890,926,261,1597,1139,29889,6803,339,7768,7890,29871,22730,29899,27048,1577,438,1481,29892,1671,339,7768,7890,29871,22730,29871,1654,2257,29627,1671,15093,10019,1690,882,1577,349,1064,275,316,7594,339,29915,348,7890,263,610,12898,316,5792,1759,427,29871,29896,29947,29900,1473,267,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,29892,818,302,4479,29892,7890,2437,568,29920,1577,3938,329,29899,5474,29892,980,269,29915,23121,316,425,26744,8288,925,29872,818,21384,316,7890,2257,29627,1577,350,999,29892,1354,7890,29871,22730,29871,1654,29892,274,29915,342,23068,818,26814,28710,29889,8748,4377,29920,29899,23088,712,1465,454,25915,316,5792,1759,427,21195,316,26805,29892,1444,6427,8284,7175,3476,15471,1190,29871,4277,1190,966,11406,5441,743,712,8556,9411,29892,8556,15210,301,29915,459,424,29892,427,269,29915,513,25138,29899,265,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,1444,16133,1908,712,8556,1047,4467,9411,966,23440,1600,1295,316,18836,29892,818,425,23520,752,7273,573,270,29915,29877,3016,348,2131,1465,966,17459,800,29892,1465,966,23440,4637,29892,1465,966,27733,2535,966,339,1379,8556,11465,787,29889,4785,309,30001,29892,427,11172,712,14954,1173,1295,29892,19601,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,818,10741,4072,270,29915,22481,29889,1174,17488,29892,373,301,29915,29891,619,424,425,29452,316,24145,8441,29889,1551,966,619,424,16731,2298,316,29871,29906,29953,29871,29900,29900,29900,18554,1750,4079,425,22360,316,619,424,270,29915,348,9122,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,309,4079,1577,315,29915,342,553,18554,439,29915,265,452,7890,707,11387,29892,1750,707,443,5246,29892,19694,553,7456,1190,966,1841,344,2993,269,10183,1314,29889,16932,4079,6003,381,553,18554,270,29915,26283,9230,1998,1524,24145,8441,29889,16932,452,16193,3479,23440,4637,23428,574,5908,316,269,29915,13699,1639,1190,24145,14326,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,29892,11797,4079,29871,4277,867,8088,17334,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,1444,766,454,3184,2320,1387,29889,461,274,29915,342,1950,1577,6803,25497,276,818,2257,1134,316,1139,29892,432,29915,1794,4370,6079,17814,29883,542,15566,22781,29889,435,29915,1794,4325,9996,29948,966,1644,13116,270,29915,14056,558,1600,1295,868,28710,29889,435,29915,1794,966,904,1639,1493,12491,29889,435,29915,1794,9484,29948,1597,2967,316,21880,443,6314,424,2298,316,4239,6063,634,23690,270,29915,26739,800,5221,3794,782,13625,316,10741,12286,29889,951,6896,499,271,29892,443,878,15340,1750,1539,425,8220,782,1302,5411,553,17459,800,29889,7747,878,15340,1671,8356,1841,4068,1089,24145,2258,15529,316,378,2974,301,29915,711,275,3335,1559,980,14924,316,1437,4713,3709,966,11406,5441,743,29889,10043,1190,2062,9030,966,953,572,1372,270,29915,265,309,291,29892,966,18554,966,4348,375,452,3435,2331,1841,24579,1064,2406,29892,2284,267,29889,11948,11797,3435,8265,29886,575,2406,29889,1174,5246,29892,301,29915,22481,29892,966,2437,7719,818,301,29915,29874,1241,29892,966,10019,1690,4110,29892,818,553,4497,787,29892,11797,3119,30000,794,4313,2406,29889,8748,1874,261,316,5881,29948,1998,568,29892,17152,381,454,26138,18836,29889,1954,22094,29920,12866,1354,26814,2637,7734,7890,2424,1064,1318,29892,7890,5178,5495,325,359,18443,743,818,5466,3709,26814,26138,18848,29889,8526,9551,261,325,359,1178,2406,1513,882,29892,2123,818,2
