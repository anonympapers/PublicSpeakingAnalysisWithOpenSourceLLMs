{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-15T01:31:09.461087796Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I have analyzed the use of negative words and expressions in the speech. The speaker uses a total of 10 negative words or expressions, which is relatively low compared to other speeches. Here are the negative words and expressions found in the transcript:\n\n1. \"pas d'utilisation significative\" ( Option 1) - This phrase suggests that there is no significant use of negative words in the speech.\n2. \"mauvais\" (Option 0) - The speaker uses this word to describe something that is bad or unpleasant, but it does not appear frequently enough to be considered a significant use of negative words.\n3. \"tristes\" (Option 0) - Like \"mauvais\", the speaker uses this word to describe something that is sad or unpleasant, but it does not stand out as a significant use of negative words.\n4. \"aucun\" (Option 0) - This word means \"none\" or \"not any\", and it is used to indicate the absence of something positive. It does not contribute to a significant use of negative words.\n5. \"impression négative\" (Option 1) - The speaker uses this phrase to describe an unfavorable impression, which is a somewhat negative expression.\n6. \"ne pas être\" (Option 0) - This phrase suggests that something is not the case, and it could be interpreted as a negative expression. However, it does not stand out as a significant use of negative words.\n7. \"pas possible\" (Option 0) - The speaker uses this phrase to suggest that something is not possible or feasible, which could be considered a somewhat negative expression.\n8. \"aucun progrès\" (Option 0) - This phrase means \"no progress\", and it could be interpreted as a negative expression. However, it does not stand out as a significant use of negative words.\n9. \"impossible\" (Option 1) - The speaker uses this word to describe something that is impossible or unfeasible, which is a more significant use of a negative word in the speech.\n10. \"pas de créativité\" (Option 0) - This phrase suggests that there is no creativity or innovation, which could be interpreted as a somewhat negative expression. However, it does not stand out as a significant use of negative words.\n\nBased on these findings, I would rate the use of negative words and expressions in the transcript as relatively low, with only a few instances that could be considered
