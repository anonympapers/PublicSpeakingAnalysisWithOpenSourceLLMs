The questionnaire provides three options for evaluating the use of negative words:\n\n0 = No significant use of negative words\n1 = Observed, but no negative impression\n2 = Remarked upon, with a negative impression\n\nFrom the transcript, I have analyzed the usage of negative words and expressions in the speaker's discourse. The results are as follows:\n\nOption chosen: 2 = Remarked upon, with a negative impression\n\nThe speaker uses negative expressions and words several times throughout the transcript. For example:\n\n* \"Sortir petit à petit de la chimie du pétrole\" (remove little by little from the oil chemistry) - This sentence contains the word \"petit\" which has a negative connotation in French.\n* \"Il y a une impressionnante collection de ces violons à la cité de la musique à Paris\" (There is an impressive collection of these violins at the Music City in Paris) - The word \"impressionnante\" can have a negative connotation, implying something that is overly impressive or showy.\n* \"La fameuse forêt l'endesse\" (The famous forest in the marshland) - The use of the word \"famous\" can imply something that is not necessarily positive or desirable.\n* \"Dans l'essence principale, est le pain maritime, et qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire avec le pain maritime?\" (In the main essence, it's the marine bread, and what can be done with marine bread?) - The use of the word \"maritime\" can have a negative connotation, implying something related to the sea or water.\n* \"Avant le gêmage, c'était une économie majeure du territoire l'endée\" (Before the gêmage, it was a major economy in the marshland territory) - The use of the word \"gêmage\" can have a negative connotation, implying something that is not necessarily positive or desirable.\n* \"Donc mon verni, en plus d'aider le saucer, utilise la ressource locale, pas le canard, non non.\" (So my varnish, in addition to helping the saucer, uses local resources, not the duck, nope.) - The use of the word \"canard\" (duck) can have a negative connotation, implying something that is not necessarily positive or desirable.\n\nBased on these examples, I have chosen option 2, as the speaker repeatedly uses negative expressions and words throughout the
