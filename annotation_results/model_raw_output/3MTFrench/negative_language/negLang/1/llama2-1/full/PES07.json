{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-15T04:05:37.918438617Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I have analyzed the use of negative words and expressions in the speech. The speaker uses a total of 17 negative words or expressions, with the most common ones being \"mal\" (bad), \"triste\" (sad), and \"pire\" (worse).\n\nHere are the options I provided for each question in the questionnaire:\n\nQuestion 11: On a scale of 0 to 2, how much negative language do you think the speaker uses in this transcription?\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No negative language used\n1 = Some negative language used, but not significant\n2 = Significant use of negative language\n\nBased on my analysis, I would rate the speaker's use of negative language as a 2, indicating a significant use of negative words and expressions. The speaker uses negative language to describe the challenges of living on Mars, the impact of human activities on the climate, and the need for a shift towards renewable resources.\n\nHere are some examples of negative language used by the speaker:\n\n* \"il m'est en œuvre toutes ces connaissances scientifiques pour tenter de survivre seul sur une planète hostile\" (p. 2) - The speaker uses the phrase \"hostile\" to describe Mars, implying that it is a difficult environment to live in.\n* \"si nous mettons nos efforts en commun pour préserver la seule planète sur laquelle nous vivons tous\" (p. 3) - The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving the planet, which implies that the current state of the environment is not ideal.\n* \"eh bien, il faut se libérer de ce monde de développement et privilégier plutôt l'utilisation des ressources renouvelables\" (p. 4) - The speaker criticizes the current development model and advocates for a shift towards renewable resources.\n* \"mais comprennent en plus l'oxygène\" (p. 5) - The speaker highlights the importance of oxygen in the molecules they are working with, implying that its absence would make them less desirable.\n\nOverall, while the speaker uses some negative language to describe the challenges of living on Mars and the impact of human activities on the environment, they also emphasize the need for a shift towards renewable resources and a more sustainable
