{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-15T01:13:00.500055889Z","response":"\nFor this analysis task, I will be analyzing the transcription provided in the questionnaire. The transcription is a speech given by a speaker who is discussing their research on the deportation of homosexuals during World War II. The speaker notes that they have consulted hundreds of books on the topic and have become obsessed with it, wanting to break the silence surrounding the subject and to share their passion with others.\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No significant use of negative words in the speech.\n1 = Remarkable, but no negative impression.\n2 = Remarkable, and it made a negative impression.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe speaker uses several negative words throughout the speech, including \"silence,\" \"crisis,\" \" déporté\" (deported), \"meurtre\" (murder), \"viol\" (rape), and \"briser\" (to break). These words create a somber tone and emphasize the tragic events of World War II. The speaker also uses phrases such as \"ils ne disaient rien\" (they said nothing) and \"ils n'avaient pas la force de traverser la rue\" (they didn't have the strength to cross the street), which convey a sense of helplessness and despair.\n\nHowever, the speaker also uses positive words such as \"comprendre\" (to understand), \"litérature\" (literature), and \"thèse\" (thesis), which suggest a desire to learn and grow through their research. The use of these words creates a contrast between the negative events of World War II and the speaker's determination to make a positive impact through their work.\n\nOverall, the speaker's use of language in this speech highlights the importance of acknowledging and understanding the tragedies of World War II, while also emphasizing the potential for growth and positive change through literature and research.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,592,3669,1403,575,270,29915,1540,16549,553,6749,29887,1475,818,399,16302,29889,435,29915,1794,25456,21394,316,18554,1465,611,6316,29889,997,715,786,442,270,29915,296,336,30058,793,3435,5758,267,29889,2664,10890,29892,1444,966,7468,639,700,610,346,712,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,11878,425,4889,316,1020,369,643,425,16014,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,1020,369,643,5278,16053,479,29889,435,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,7199,9030,1671,339,7768,29871,29896,29945,29871,29900,29900,29900,3632,29438,29884,4999,23997,4370,1437,637,743,1465,966,339,4999,24145,26702,29889,382,29883,2663,29920,29892,26269,316,8556,29892,7890,301,29915,296,3324,29920,29892,26269,316,8556,980,343,263,454,15142,29889,12390,17137,11113,375,1465,966,592,453,787,316,301,29915,13624,29889,16932,4625,4370,1437,637,743,1465,553,3949,567,316,26702,29889,997,2967,29892,454,18848,707,818,364,465,6967,1465,966,19638,5908,29889,2664,3581,567,316,611,5702,553,5886,29899,29886,417,567,1190,966,21206,1475,2085,29890,2406,29889,2664,2117,1862,1190,794,966,3516,3775,29892,3503,11797,452,766,10978,21181,29889,6803,339,7768,1577,1459,346,439,29915,2719,2453,352,296,23422,10503,440,276,443,14857,8694,29889,15113,29892,432,29915,1794,301,29915,11728,7015,21880,316,301,29915,13624,634,2298,432,29915,1794,425,7814,1318,29889,2581,302,29915,279,4401,2331,427,260,9030,966,2181,275,29892,966,13159,492,1912,316,7015,1437,637,743,29889,2581,302,29915,1794,875,355,29884,10440,712,454,15142,29889,838,943,29892,1444,592,26099,10733,29948,1224,425,27940,29889,8748,274,29915,342,5695,454,29140,316,611,266,17449,29889,435,29915,1794,27883,553,1644,13116,634,553,1644,13116,270,29915,5128,6617,1190,425,1437,637,362,3632,29438,13498,29889,1720,286,29915,29891,1083,545,1249,818,1601,28074,1924,29892,274,29915,342,1437,637,29948,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,452,28078,11818,2331,712,611,19886,1318,29892,2257,712,611,19886,1318,29892,2257,712,1444,302,29915,1794,29892,2257,19886,3709,1190,301,29915,29882,25892,316,301,29915,2190,29889,435,29915,1794,1104,29884,29892,634,432,29915,1794,1104,29884,7015,6515,29889,435,29915,1794,3643,1354,10440,29892,10440,29892,270,29915,18288,1813,29889,4241,841,424,29892,11797,3435,18916,29889,435,29915,1794,2654,293,17856,966,301,30000,29894,690,29892,432,29915,1794,2654,293,17856,966,26809,316,7015,1437,637,743,29889,16932,3435,21617,375,8774,29888,690,1465,1597,904,6468,316,15935,29892,316,752,465,291,29892,712,425,27940,592,14924,4904,29889,435,29915,1794,966,3686,2747,1249,1465,966,13137,29889,1720,286,29915,609,610,12898,29889,435,29915,9983,1908,19397,7890,9073,760,1875,22572,29915,15669,29892,611,15935,1671,2257,18848,29889,315,29915,342,443,18848,29889,2581,652,23469,270,29915,1279,29948,5458,15694,6947,533,29889,1720,1136,2488,29892,7890,454,992,4099,29920,29892,2257,15142,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,454,1506,7608,29889,435,29915,1794,8829,347,316,1083,13974,2265,454,15142,610,553,286,1862,29889,8748,9411,966,286,1862,1750,592,286,29915,29874,2073,427,592,24811,818,301,29915,487,1924,29892,9411,966,286,1862,712,1444,301,275,1465,7015,6017,550,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,966,17161,261,270,29915,24430,427,19601,634,18158,316,7890,966,9073,760,1875,29889,12390,17137,29899,27048,29892,11797,452,3435,2331,325,336,2073,5758,29889,16932,1863
