For example, they mention \"des petits organismes\" (small organisms) that could be the source of illnesses, and use the phrase \"rien de bon\" (nothing good) to describe the quality of the soil after composting. These negative words create a negative impression and contribute to the overall pessimistic tone of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,1671,18104,4797,634,301,29915,329,374,683,20877,29948,29892,7175,13082,5582,316,286,4600,17256,10098,634,966,1410,5475,610,8694,1671,11469,1597,15378,545,20877,29948,29889,11948,7890,452,7890,29871,22730,18413,9667,29948,1354,11797,3435,640,9103,743,610,553,19518,2373,574,1379,29889,315,29915,342,818,2970,610,316,5646,5697,1169,2894,1608,267,29892,443,1998,15705,818,301,29915,348,329,1750,263,2331,316,1326,29877,7808,553,4439,3076,29889,315,29915,342,5646,17887,2894,1608,267,2894,1608,267,3435,5814,1237,760,449,634,8164,29899,5474,818,301,29915,17234,316,23068,1671,6701,316,1487,13219,3597,29889,422,1004,553,904,5935,2249,583,316,12642,4323,29948,768,267,1750,302,29915,29874,2331,1597,289,7293,503,29875,2749,1318,2123,10440,316,6896,21558,3479,3677,747,24414,3783,1750,8164,9589,9945,553,2411,465,267,1935,2390,1893,3783,634,12866,818,425,5758,29889,2664,9221,12906,371,1295,1671,4185,29875,7808,6267,12584,5495,966,1410,9351,22700,296,316,2298,427,2298,553,3033,23469,1661,20674,3783,29889,853,270,29915,14056,23778,29892,4875,263,752,520,316,553,521,294,2894,3783,4191,966,429,17053,2123,966,1437,305,879,2658,29889,951,752,520,482,707,270,29915,348,9580,2093,553,5469,3137,1750,14924,316,1437,629,1664,966,274,2487,17192,1446,610,553,9200,6388,1608,267,29889,27714,2257,9580,2093,29899,29879,375,29892,980,343,263,5802,316,521,744,1295,2257,1750,2947,19172,276,316,260,2853,966,289,627,29948,2722,29889,11948,2257,9580,2093,553,325,336,583,9119,361,3783,1671,966,429,17053,29892,1559,980,21668,4048,6390,712,1465,443,4595,270,29915,735,29883,5606,358,980,343,263,427,28504,29871,29896,29900,29900,14746,316,289,627,29948,2722,29889,438,1481,29871,29896,29900,29900,14746,980,16933,6079,2432,29885,482,316,18741,4427,2131,316,13164,7814,25999,634,7814,10918,9351,610,7015,289,627,29948,2722,29892,3503,980,343,263,2331,316,2504,283,634,274,29915,342,18916,6722,432,29915,1639,29894,993,29889,1174,20744,29892,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,5898,425,2428,4924,316,425,315,29899,29873,786,1901,29892,316,425,2088,328,283,29892,707,316,1437,18821,261,269,29915,309,3667,895,553,429,17053,5541,743,29892,9073,1224,966,1437,29887,30057,1372,316,425,18741,4427,4371,29892,553,12584,7545,634,553,10918,9351,610,553,289,627,29948,2722,29889,10050,23422,2331,15243,330,8146,1671,301,29915,5474,3165,475,29892,3503,427,2298,6896,391,1647,3479,3677,747,24414,3783,4191,10042,8556,9580,2093,553,29889,405,681,1029,787,5246,553,3483,952,267,1190,966,1437,305,1691,2894,3783,316,6367,457,13019,3165,9874,17751,1893,744,29892,7847,1190,966,752,520,267,29892,18158,1190,966,25999,634,1671,1436,381,1190,966,285,21211,29889,5202,276,358,6309,29892,8556,1029,787,3686,388,29948,316,8689,2257,439,29915,309,343,7905,443,11412,316,16317,29948,1195,362,316,7015,289,627,29948,2722,6896,391,3794,553,429,17053,5541,743,9291,29915,585,367,585,10918,2017,712,7890,4788,29920,1136,290,1050,1671,11469,1597,15378,545,20877,29948,29889,8748,7890,4078,29920,439,7768,29973,751,295,802,12852,4875,454,1437,305,1691,2894,3783,3483,952,1318,782,13949,270,29915,627,29948,2722,6896,391,3794,3479,3677,747,24414,3783,302,29915,29874,4370,5663,5128,29948,7907,439,29915,265,1400,482,29889,7747,439,29915,309,21668,337,880,381,29892,274,29915,342,712,454,16731,13382,707,782,2730,11771,6366,815,1671,16497,7608,7814,1437,305,1691
