{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-15T02:50:33.317905977Z","response":"\nBased on the provided transcript, I will answer the questionnaire as follows:\n\nQuestion 11: On a scale of 0 to 2, how would you rate the use of negative words in the speech of this transcription?\n\nOption chosen: 2 - Remarked, and it had a bad impression.\n\nExplanation: Throughout the transcript, there are several instances of negative words and expressions used by the speaker. For example, the speaker refers to the \"malère du monde\" (line 10), which can be translated to \"the mess of the world.\" They also use phrases such as \"il s'est préoccupé que vous soyez toujours heureux\" (line 24), which can be translated to \"he was concerned that you should always be happy.\" These negative phrases and words create a sense of unease and pessimism throughout the speech, which is reflected in the speaker's overall tone. Therefore, I have chosen option 2 - Remarked, and it had a bad impression.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1954,22094,29920,29892,1597,19859,610,497,15340,1465,454,13949,29899,29894,449,9411,29892,11549,1249,270,29915,348,521,28411,5411,5999,29948,29892,270,29915,348,8372,29884,29899,3221,29892,270,29915,348,380,2904,2488,29892,270,29915,348,2723,275,2172,1750,544,6430,598,1671,7890,5646,325,359,715,1446,7175,9035,29892,634,270,29915,348,10814,439,29915,309,269,29915,6574,627,1750,1436,749,325,359,410,27499,454,2298,6299,29892,634,1750,269,29915,342,7175,16770,296,712,7890,577,4099,29920,15237,540,545,1314,29889,315,29915,342,782,19666,16794,424,454,301,29915,23578,749,29892,634,12563,5278,26744,4805,4356,21735,16794,424,454,3847,29889,28266,553,4224,2108,583,634,11643,1189,1041,427,1841,29882,681,1039,818,1098,1091,2853,425,5544,4427,2131,316,5646,425,4439,1908,868,9122,29892,782,3847,29889,27816,9577,7006,316,23662,2488,29892,274,29915,342,443,266,1064,2093,818,3440,966,11825,23778,9364,296,10713,3847,284,7719,29889,9353,24145,9257,29892,980,343,263,1597,1098,9030,1671,712,425,3847,29874,30085,6772,12852,15237,1597,1518,4894,663,13686,361,29889,951,17222,3847,29892,620,283,538,553,16812,3146,1912,7774,267,29892,553,19431,4019,800,29892,634,5644,262,316,5697,1169,13840,290,275,1934,29889,2664,21038,269,29915,264,29926,424,277,12866,966,11825,2906,336,993,7848,966,2298,540,545,1314,316,9122,29889,315,29915,342,425,325,336,347,611,13871,29892,2331,5646,454,8714,29889,1551,22259,2131,707,337,862,264,872,9950,12137,29889,5701,9950,12137,263,13547,544,283,475,712,8997,443,2298,553,286,13533,302,29915,29874,2331,443,302,29915,279,361,2298,818,2257,2665,381,10259,492,1465,10713,364,30069,793,316,11825,29889,1720,269,29915,342,772,895,29889,997,23520,2637,23778,29899,29885,30037,4467,29892,1750,269,29915,342,2298,2298,712,454,14583,270,29915,3470,7147,29889,478,681,29871,22730,11468,275,29973,9194,794,966,11825,443,6701,302,29915,342,269,4987,2331,439,29915,309,269,29915,5128,276,316,289,824,424,3847,284,29889,2664,1136,21871,2063,316,289,824,424,3847,284,3435,9577,269,5903,5908,29889,15113,316,18669,277,29892,2298,316,21448,29892,2298,316,3480,3473,663,818,553,286,4298,29878,1893,2925,29889,17812,7446,2409,13524,29892,966,3581,2701,29892,966,5216,7545,875,29038,29889,2598,17889,427,11172,712,11643,324,6235,1136,2488,7907,6003,381,966,2298,286,13533,316,11825,29889,26383,4883,5321,20608,1041,8556,1029,787,378,24359,443,19607,316,7175,7316,1750,1998,1249,818,1841,9176,1089,427,11825,316,425,724,1690,2131,868,3060,861,29892,316,425,26470,29889,8407,9587,270,29915,1131,29948,4926,29892,4581,29899,29963,277,29880,30000,862,424,818,623,29878,9030,316,11043,316,26805,316,22884,29889,2726,5644,1475,27688,29892,553,330,2297,553,904,14817,1080,2923,293,5475,29889,11948,29892,3440,4048,6390,712,1601,1006,7316,302,29915,342,6366,815,1577,382,29882,6079,29892,1444,285,1572,275,1465,425,17949,553,11825,29889,478,681,1671,2546,29920,7890,2970,29892,4875,263,11643,1189,434,12866,274,29915,342,4226,29889,11948,1444,1072,19755,3479,4047,7147,923,345,1314,29889,6803,904,791,2853,301,29915,29948,2416,562,2131,316,5278,1006,7316,29892,1444,301,29915,1794,2062,29948,2608,29948,553,5697,3246,8575,267,316,923,345,1314,10042,634,818,425,9073,553,1824,4467,1671,5734,261,454,260,2993,316,13979,275,324,2117,2911,533,29892,1766,7808,2742,868,22884,17168,1387,29892,634,4323,3709,301,29915,283
