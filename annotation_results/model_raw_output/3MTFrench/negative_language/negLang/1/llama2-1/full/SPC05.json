{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-14T19:54:29.922836834Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I will analyze the use of negative words and expressions in the speech. The questionnaire asks for the evaluation of the use of negative words and expressions in the transcript on a scale of 0 to 2, where 0 means no significant use of negative words and 2 means obvious and frequent use.\n\nAfter analyzing the transcript, I have identified several instances of negative words and expressions used by the speaker:\n\n1. \"Mauvais\" - The speaker uses the word \"mauvais\" to describe the arrival delay of the signal from the pepite to the other (line 14). This is a negative expression as it implies that something went wrong or is not functioning as expected.\n2. \"Tristes\" - The speaker uses the word \"tristes\" to describe the situation where the signal from one pepite to the other is delayed (line 16). This word also has a negative connotation, implying sadness or disappointment.\n3. \"Pas d'utilisation significative de mots négatifs\" - The speaker notes that there is no significant use of negative words in the transcript (line 20). This option represents the absence of any negative words or expressions in the transcript.\n4. \"Rémarqué, mais pas d'impression négative\" - The speaker describes the situation where the signal from one pepite to the other is delayed, but notes that it is not necessarily a negative thing (line 22). This option represents a mildly negative sentiment, as the speaker notes that something is amiss, but does not convey any strong feelings of disappointment or frustration.\n5. \"Remarqué, et cela a fait une mauvaise impression\" - The speaker describes the situation where the signal from one pepite to the other is delayed, and notes that it has made a bad impression (line 24). This option represents a more negative sentiment, as the speaker explicitly states that something has gone wrong and has caused a negative impact.\n\nBased on these observations, I would choose option 1: \"Pas d'utilisation significative de mots négatifs\" for the evaluation of the use of negative words and expressions in the transcript. The speaker does not use any significant negative words or expressions throughout the transcript, which suggests that the tone is generally neutral or positive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,17043,790,1249,29899,23088,966,8287,575,818,289,2209,1577,8526,425,12320,553,626,473,29892,966,4439,305,3794,1465,301,29915,267,1129,381,7035,316,409,1841,700,533,425,410,5815,457,10395,420,289,5442,29889,11948,2257,452,3435,2331,966,409,7273,29889,29871,30219,29874,325,4244,712,18916,29899,29882,1300,29892,966,534,265,283,275,5695,29564,7628,339,29915,2719,3435,626,25664,1314,29889,2664,534,265,283,275,409,3435,7015,19340,3794,1912,904,517,5475,5758,267,29892,16530,20564,2313,29878,21017,29889,11948,7628,339,29915,2719,10733,296,26269,270,29915,348,752,4211,265,29892,11797,409,4224,8663,19702,29891,10460,6267,1652,314,1004,29889,2664,4824,1654,575,1634,5908,3999,3581,2701,316,534,265,283,275,427,904,13147,424,7015,521,1934,270,29915,27419,29892,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,16504,8310,7018,23497,29889,422,1004,425,19703,5289,29892,966,16504,8310,7018,23497,12278,1179,818,6815,325,3246,344,29892,29871,29941,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,2383,610,1473,267,29889,11948,1354,443,2560,7167,9378,277,818,409,734,26535,1358,425,19703,5289,29892,21181,302,29915,2749,9061,7814,16504,8310,7018,23497,1190,6267,1020,4026,1224,425,18249,29889,14447,8556,29892,274,29915,342,443,2428,2730,11771,1671,5152,291,1089,966,534,265,283,12935,818,6815,5418,29889,11948,14034,29920,28185,9373,29892,21907,760,18916,29899,29882,1300,29892,443,7303,316,534,265,283,12935,904,29885,21017,553,373,2783,8310,7018,29876,4999,29889,16457,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,7015,373,2783,8310,7018,29876,4999,29892,1444,16731,966,1437,371,312,261,1661,2331,2535,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,29892,3503,6079,29871,29941,3290,514,3246,29889,5462,425,8825,409,21714,343,818,301,29915,15654,273,29892,7175,1365,277,270,29915,264,1365,7598,1465,301,29915,267,3535,29889,6803,6628,1314,7199,9030,29892,634,1671,7779,7608,26814,623,1893,277,10042,301,29915,23048,545,868,20487,300,29892,1444,7890,16193,316,5734,261,301,29915,14540,818,443,592,4951,29892,1671,261,2535,7732,282,6430,3246,316,521,542,324,271,29889,478,681,301,29915,264,510,1457,29920,966,282,6430,3246,409,3435,4473,271,3610,3246,29889,16579,802,1597,270,29915,14056,20554,427,1365,347,443,5246,1190,425,4022,533,3479,4239,10890,29889,997,5418,2637,966,282,6430,3246,29892,274,29915,342,29871,29906,29871,29900,29900,29900,2383,29892,634,12866,454,8714,316,1020,4026,316,425,19703,5289,425,4022,533,707,12471,29871,29947,330,29889,6101,16134,424,29892,11797,302,29915,609,1597,8310,7018,23497,21714,2637,4883,282,6430,3246,29892,454,592,4951,1597,298,2147,330,265,29888,280,10918,1908,358,4191,1465,443,3023,29889,8748,966,282,6430,3246,29892,274,29915,342,454,697,966,1597,553,10890,29889,951,8714,316,1020,4026,707,270,29915,1540,282,6430,568,818,301,29915,18288,29892,634,1874,29948,29892,4875,1804,744,425,4022,533,302,29915,279,4401,2331,818,6267,544,5903,29884,29889,838,943,7890,4788,29920,592,2970,29892,274,29915,342,6079,5016,3274,29892,15243,534,1682,29892,3503,19601,29892,1444,29758,5644,262,316,1153,14125,1750,1671,336,1518,492,7808,454,3240,538,868,425,4022,533,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,712,454,7182,302,29915,342,2331,17756,8532,29892,2123,6079,8164,29899,5474,712,301,29915,272,417,479,452,18332,2331,454,2684,29892,925,882,1601,18848,29892,274,29915,342,316,7019,862,261,782,6628,1314,454,3240,538,868,3479,373,3874,29894,7018,9139,29892,1750,3240
