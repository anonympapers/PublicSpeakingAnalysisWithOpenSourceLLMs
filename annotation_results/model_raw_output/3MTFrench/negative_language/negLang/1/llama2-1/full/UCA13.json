For each question, I will choose one of the options 0, 1, or 2 to represent my answer.\n\nQuestion 11: Based on the transcript, how significant is the use of negative words/expressions in the speaker's discourse? (Negative words/expressions include \"bad\", \"worse\", etc.)\n\nOption chosen: 2 - Remarked, and it had a negative impression.\n\nThe speaker uses negative words/expressions multiple times throughout the transcript, such as \"bad\", \"worse\", \"can't\", \"don't\", and \"not good enough\". These phrases are used to describe the speaker's thoughts and feelings about their current situation, which suggests that they are feeling unsuccessful and disappointed. The use of negative words/expressions is significant in this case because it highlights the speaker's frustration and dissatisfaction with their circumstances.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2453,1321,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,29871,30309,29884,413,267,262,413,328,279,1146,29773,413,277,568,29871,30276,30253,413,2142,557,277,941,343,481,29885,9010,501,29909,29999,3352,2606,30364,30412,1388,15296,4393,3162,19242,383,3781,1049,30130,29892,2443,31203,12528,316,30200,309,29892,437,30200,284,330,680,346,30200,326,29889,6629,29911,8574,6269,3365,343,554,29892,413,913,279,343,554,29889,289,10077,29943,6530,31198,25334,352,332,398,560,8623,6940,262,1010,326,311,5609,2453,21159,12737,911,5478,1175,2679,4404,5951,839,381,4404,1258,295,326,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,2831,445,3414,29892,306,674,367,29537,292,278,970,1301,3395,4944,297,278,934,376,26813,7187,24290,29889,3945,29908,2729,373,278,5155,297,278,1139,15421,29889,1152,1269,1139,29892,306,674,6755,697,310,278,3987,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,470,29871,29906,304,2755,590,1234,29889,13,13,16492,29871,29896,29896,29901,16564,373,278,1301,924,29892,920,7282,338,278,671,310,8178,3838,29914,17073,1080,297,278,25657,29915,29879,2313,10242,29973,313,29940,387,1230,3838,29914,17073,1080,3160,376,12313,613,376,13762,344,613,2992,1846,13,13,8375,10434,29901,29871,29906,448,5240,935,287,29892,322,372,750,263,8178,17188,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3913,8178,3838,29914,17073,1080,2999,3064,10106,278,1301,924,29892,1316,408,376,12313,613,376,13762,344,613,376,3068,29915,29873,613,376,9176,29915,29873,613,322,376,1333,1781,3307,1642,4525,12216,2129,526,1304,304,8453,278,25657,29915,29879,13133,322,21737,1048,1009,1857,6434,29892,607,14661,393,896,526,11223,443,8698,1319,322,23451,287,29889,450,671,310,8178,3838,29914,17073,1080,338,7282,297,445,1206,1363,372,12141,29879,278,25657,29915,29879,1424,11036,322,16317,27685,2467,411,1009,142
