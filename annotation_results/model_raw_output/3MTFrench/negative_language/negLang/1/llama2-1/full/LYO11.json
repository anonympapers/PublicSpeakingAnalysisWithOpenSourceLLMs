{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-15T03:21:36.079845038Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I will analyze the use of negative words and expressions in the speaker's discourse. The questionnaire provided includes a question about the usage of negative words in the transcription, with three options: 0 (No significant use of negative words), 1 (Noticed, but no negative impression), and 2 (Noticed, and it made a bad impression).\n\nFrom my analysis of the transcript, I observe that the speaker uses a total of 17 negative words or expressions, which is relatively low compared to other speakers. However, there are some instances where the speaker uses negative words or expressions in a way that could be perceived as negative or critical:\n\n1. The speaker uses the word \"mauvais\" (bad) to describe the information provided by the journalist on BFMTV, which could be seen as a negative evaluation of the journalist's work.\n2. The speaker compares the journalist's lack of information to a \"caillot dans la chaussure\" (blister in the shoe), which could be interpreted as a criticism of the journalist's abilities.\n3. The speaker uses the phrase \"il n'y a plus de nouvelles\" (there are no more news) to describe the situation when there is no information available, which could be seen as a negative commentary on the lack of information.\n4. The speaker describes the journalist's communication as \"brannaire rampant\" (strange/weird ramble), which could be interpreted as a criticism of the journalist's speaking style.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the speaker's use of negative words and expressions in this context is not necessarily meant to be critical or negative. The speaker is simply describing the situation and using language that they are familiar with to convey their message.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my analysis of the transcript provided, I would answer question 11 with option 1 (Noticed, but no negative impression). The speaker uses a limited number of negative words and expressions in their discourse, and while there are some instances where the language could be interpreted as critical or negative, it is not the primary intention of the
