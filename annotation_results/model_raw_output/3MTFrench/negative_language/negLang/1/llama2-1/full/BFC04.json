{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-14T10:24:56.592531097Z","response":"\nBased on the provided transcript, I will analyze the usage of negative words and expressions in the speaker's discourse. The transcript is from a lecture where the speaker is discussing the importance of understanding the behavior of rolling motion in various systems.\n\nThe speaker uses a total of 15 negative words or expressions throughout the transcript. Here are the options I have chosen for each question in the questionnaire:\n\nQuestion 11: On a scale of 0 to 2, how much negativity is there in the speaker's discourse?\n\nOption choisie: 2 - The speaker uses negative words and expressions frequently throughout the transcript, particularly when discussing the potential impact of rolling motion deficiencies on system performance.\n\nHere are the negative words or expressions used by the speaker:\n\n1. \"mauvais\" (meaning \"bad\") - used twice in the transcript.\n2. \"tristes\" (meaning \"boring\") - used once in the transcript.\n3. \"pas d'utilisation significative\" (meaning \"no significant use\") - used to describe the lack of importance of rolling motion in a particular context.\n4. \"remarqué, mais pas d'impression négative\" (meaning \"noticed, but no negative impression\") - used to describe the speaker's observation of a phenomenon without any negative connotation.\n5. \"déjà, elle est pas que des pyramides\" (meaning \"already, she is not just pyramids\") - used to emphasize the speaker's point that rolling motion is not limited to certain objects or situations.\n6. \"il faudra ensuite attendre le 15e siècle\" (meaning \"you will have to wait until the 15th century\") - used to exaggerate the potential impact of rolling motion deficiencies on system performance.\n7. \"voilà, parfois il arrive que les bagues ne sont pas parfaitement circulaires\" (meaning \"here, sometimes it happens that the bags are not perfectly circular\") - used to explain the potential limitations of rolling motion in certain situations.\n8. \"je vous explique\" (meaning \"I will explain to you\") - used to introduce a new concept or idea with a negative connotation.\n9. \"imaginez-vous partir en vacances dans votre super voiture de la région\" (meaning \"imagine yourself going on vacation in your supercar from the region\") - used to create a hypothetical scenario with a negative connotation (the speaker is not actually going on vacation).\n10. \"vos parties\" (meaning \"your parties\") - used to refer to a hypothetical situation where the speaker is not actually attending any parties.\n\nOverall, the speaker uses negative words and expressions sparingly but effectively throughout the transcript to emphasize their points and create a more engaging and interactive lecture for the
