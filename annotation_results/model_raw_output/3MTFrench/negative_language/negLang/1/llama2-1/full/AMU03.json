The questionnaire provides three options to choose from:\n\n0 - No significant use of negative words/expressions\n1 - Noticeable use of negative words/expressions, but no negative impression\n2 - Notable use of negative words/expressions, which left a bad impression\n\nFrom the transcript, I have identified the following instances of negative words or expressions:\n\n* \"inqui√©tes\" (line 14) - This word has a negative connotation, as it refers to feelings of uncertainty or anxiety.\n* \"eglier\" (line 17) - This verb has a negative connotation, as it implies trying to push someone away from something.\n* \"maladies inflexibles\" (line 24) - The term \"inflexible\" has a negative connotation, as it refers to something that is rigid or unyielding.\n* \"infections\" (line 31) - While the word \"infection\" itself is neutral, the context in which it is used suggests a negative connotation, as it refers to the presence of harmful microorganisms in the body.\n* \"morts\" (line 42) - The term \"morts\" has a negative connotation, as it refers to death or the deceased.\n* \"pas vraiment convaincu\" (line 46) - This phrase has a negative connotation, as it suggests a lack of confidence or conviction.\n\nBased on these observations, I would rate the usage of negative words and expressions in the speaker's discourse as option 1: Noticeable use of negative words/expressions, but no negative impression. The speaker uses some negative words and expressions, but they are not overly prominent or impactful, and the overall tone of the discourse is still positive and passionate about the speaker's work.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,2023,751,392,432,29915,879,275,11878,454,8714,29892,432,29915,1794,4224,23048,301,29915,1279,29948,2007,347,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,2535,301,29915,29948,9258,29892,966,10701,1006,442,2406,29889,8748,7847,29892,443,8694,29892,432,29915,1794,5221,29948,818,1601,7017,26639,631,316,12584,1924,29892,1597,325,336,347,1841,29894,3610,362,316,425,432,29915,29876,29915,29874,11878,439,29915,348,1178,1318,427,17949,316,6003,381,3190,423,1314,24612,1336,1189,1041,29889,951,23662,2488,1750,707,868,26799,29892,425,6434,868,1209,29948,29892,263,8019,316,2257,712,301,29915,5474,5663,5128,1318,316,12584,1924,3190,29948,1188,1387,29889,751,392,432,29915,1251,583,347,409,1539,29873,29892,373,5246,3700,818,13545,1006,9102,800,29889,24337,20067,2470,707,316,10679,2535,553,26943,18484,6079,29892,3503,553,26943,297,6578,1691,1671,24145,263,15470,634,1750,12033,296,316,8556,7779,4926,1224,270,29915,14559,27264,793,29889,3219,5178,453,5908,270,29915,20659,782,5321,15532,29892,610,17488,29892,274,29915,342,443,2432,9874,6722,980,343,263,7006,316,1437,29890,3222,29948,634,980,21668,9073,316,301,29915,265,7890,2852,1151,29892,316,301,29915,265,7890,2852,1151,29892,2123,29875,29889,8748,316,301,29915,265,8694,27962,782,10212,20141,818,2656,381,966,784,21017,553,339,4999,439,29915,309,707,7175,16349,868,8714,1750,21714,29889,16579,802,885,29877,20200,29892,14738,29892,15096,29892,12377,424,29892,707,443,4348,29884,29892,1597,26744,2535,1487,325,4582,29884,634,3999,380,335,29885,1078,29889,435,29915,1794,5291,6309,10713,10890,634,26154,29892,10713,29342,284,583,1750,20423,29202,286,29915,14108,7808,425,29845,270,29915,1540,4439,328,347,3041,2506,13498,16530,5289,29889,8748,316,2257,1298,316,10402,29892,1750,301,29915,513,3640,29884,29892,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,18158,425,1841,16707,316,7015,4439,328,583,29892,818,301,29915,17192,1808,553,11840,3190,29948,1188,3783,634,316,10713,23093,29889,951,1302,5411,316,611,23520,29892,274,29915,342,316,260,5893,270,29915,342,707,4193,425,760,712,12450,2016,7015,297,1725,1953,1465,966,25698,19503,316,20877,29948,553,23093,7242,9387,29889,422,29890,819,29892,610,17488,29892,270,29915,513,3640,29884,818,8714,316,269,29915,29891,977,5582,29892,14255,966,5239,1446,316,425,1841,4068,11076,29892,443,8288,29892,6722,301,29915,293,1318,634,1601,2600,24782,15963,269,29915,29891,3677,22781,923,369,609,707,29892,3503,260,29915,267,325,336,2073,2331,7602,475,4979,29889,8748,5291,766,966,5758,29879,29892,439,29915,309,343,263,277,553,5758,29879,29892,3503,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,325,336,2073,1597,10466,2684,29872,29889,1174,5246,29892,2257,3435,553,21195,1750,29231,453,296,316,13135,267,29892,1559,29202,29892,634,5291,766,712,301,29915,29874,680,302,29915,342,2331,9378,275,424,29889,838,943,29892,23563,16283,29892,432,29915,264,5445,267,301,29915,1540,1999,1709,634,553,330,1934,29889,8748,1444,14954,1173,966,5544,1849,316,7015,4439,328,583,3041,2506,3145,29889,7747,3435,966,24424,2123,966,289,627,4894,1912,29892,818,8019,316,7175,2608,882,29892,316,5697,1169,13855,4467,427,3248,267,29889,435,29915,404,15802,316,1437,371,312,261,301,29915,3035,29940,316,7015,9200,5707,29889,315,29915,342,818,2970,425,9637,6094,19971,316,425,29845,316,7015,9200,5707,1465,966,3966,744,698,267,712,432,29915,1794,6309,29889,9194,794,29892,1444,16623,521,283,2204,424,29889,1
