The questionnaire provided is:\n\nQuestion 11. On a scale of 0 to 2, evaluate the use of negative words/expressions in the speech. (Negative words/expressions: bad, sad, etc. Expressions negative: it's not the worst solution, etc.)\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No significant use of negative words/expressions.\n1 = Noticed, but no negative impression.\n2 = Noticed, and it left a negative impression.\n\nThe speaker uses a total of 6 negative words/expressions in their speech:\n\n1. \"Bourneau\" - This word is used to describe the paradise island where the speaker was on vacation, but it has a slightly negative connotation due to the use of the word \"paradise\" which can sometimes be seen as exaggerated or overly positive.\n2. \"Métaux\" - The word \"métaux\" is used to refer to the plants that absorb metals, but it has a somewhat negative connotation due to the association with heavy metals, which can be harmful to the environment and human health.\n3. \"Pas grand chose à cultiver\" - This sentence contains the word \"pas grand chose\", which means \"not much\" in French, but it has a slightly negative connotation due to the use of the word \"pas\".\n4. \"Délaisser\" - The verb \"délaisser\" means \"to neglect\" or \"to ignore\", and it has a negative connotation.\n5. \"Filantu\" - This word is used to describe the nickel content in the plants, but it has a slightly negative connotation due to the association with the word \"filth\".\n6. \"Brûlé\" - The verb \"brûlé\" means \"burned\", and it has a negative connotation.\n\nBased on these observations, I would rate the use of negative words/expressions in the speaker's discourse as a 1 (Noticed, but no negative impression). While there are some negative words/expressions used in the speech, they are not frequent or dominant, and they do not significantly detract from the overall positive tone of the speech. The speaker is mostly enthusiastic and passionate about their project, and they use language that reflects this positivity.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,578,381,29892,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,7890,2437,1524,1465,443,17775,29889,2581,364,14056,5646,925,29872,270,29915,294,29899,29891,868,5053,29899,342,29892,316,301,29915,26917,26811,275,562,316,12340,484,585,29889,2581,302,29915,28899,275,2331,427,11757,2925,29889,435,29915,28899,275,427,1518,24773,1465,425,363,11992,9201,28148,1190,7015,260,29899,309,9364,296,553,715,3794,4805,536,1099,2658,29892,1750,409,302,473,29878,19047,553,8774,386,2631,868,899,29889,997,2362,9364,296,5695,553,16895,4285,29892,1750,302,29915,609,2331,4595,12784,818,4185,2147,634,712,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,263,1241,29889,435,29915,1794,28643,966,8774,3068,1608,267,270,29915,6897,272,683,316,7015,715,3794,1671,19172,276,3479,9221,12906,371,1295,316,966,3814,357,1190,553,25999,9577,8261,267,427,11510,2993,29889,315,3100,707,20737,12036,424,427,4092,29892,427,21805,347,29892,1190,553,25999,8164,9073,29899,29873,29899,309,2123,1437,11818,643,1577,8748,425,289,473,20141,316,3444,634,270,29915,22537,347,12931,1296,29882,29892,409,3435,4067,743,2535,966,610,1912,5233,2993,316,3792,1759,347,1671,9484,261,425,8861,610,29879,1808,9201,28148,553,260,29899,309,316,7015,2428,572,3794,29889,8748,992,309,30001,3440,1444,592,26099,5663,5128,29948,2778,316,11449,25226,818,301,29915,29282,316,29871,29906,29946,29889,28266,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,29871,29896,29947,29900,29900,29892,432,29915,1794,286,29915,542,4979,412,316,29871,29953,29947,29900,289,10126,29948,715,3794,1750,409,302,473,29878,19047,316,11510,2993,29889,365,29915,2015,484,585,707,977,424,29884,29892,409,2143,375,29892,425,302,473,29878,9948,818,301,29915,1117,8105,29948,29889,838,943,373,2947,966,623,7367,2331,5646,316,432,1662,29889,10043,5646,316,432,1662,640,993,2225,802,29871,29941,29995,316,25985,295,29889,10016,10098,1506,30095,12898,29892,274,29915,342,29871,29896,29900,29900,29995,4555,373,640,7081,29871,29941,29900,15543,315,29915,342,6079,2298,712,966,1375,1064,30000,16105,17541,4582,433,455,339,882,1750,452,640,23510,712,29871,29896,29892,29906,29995,25985,295,29889,1174,7438,29871,29906,29900,29896,29947,29892,2535,1597,25740,316,14954,1173,1295,7691,29892,8556,626,11689,427,2058,553,20075,4110,19172,424,316,10252,276,454,25985,295,1465,966,3438,9351,29899,303,19503,1465,966,610,3729,267,712,7890,992,4099,29920,589,9318,19601,29889,12390,714,2719,8556,19172,296,316,4048,6390,454,20299,882,868,25985,295,29889,1459,17488,29892,8556,19172,296,316,1841,1054,357,301,29915,14531,1750,3581,280,454,1472,553,20491,7545,1750,29370,454,899,2123,1750,3581,280,454,1472,553,534,681,29889,2581,592,7697,8648,9411,966,12134,17478,427,611,30085,29879,347,1671,8689,4883,289,10126,29948,715,3794,29889,2581,1841,1054,371,13214,868,899,712,432,29915,7054,895,818,425,10098,1190,454,28439,634,427,10212,20141,29892,18934,316,4880,261,13214,6267,3006,332,427,25985,295,29889,1632,20032,818,7015,6896,19718,29892,1465,4832,17478,29892,1444,3669,29882,1249,818,7594,1298,425,9257,316,7015,715,3794,634,7847,966,9946,29899,303,19503,427,25985,295,29889,9353,443,7006,2298,270,29915,348,385,29892,20737,29892,1444,2181,347,443,878,15340,29892,1601,509,261,818,7594,1298,425,9257,316,7015,715,3794,707,6366,815,634,23990,519,1671,427,9073,443,21423,316,13162,15471,818,301,29915,4548,417,7018,7903,332,29889,2726,14954,1173,1295,316,24
