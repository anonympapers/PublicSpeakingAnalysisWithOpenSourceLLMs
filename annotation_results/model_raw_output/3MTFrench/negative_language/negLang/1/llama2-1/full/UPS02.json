Based on the questions in the QUESTIONNAIRE, I will answer each question by choosing one of the options provided (0, 1, or 2) and explain my choice.\n\nQuestion 11: On a scale of 0 to 2, how much do you think negative words/expressions are used in this speech?\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No significant use of negative words/expressions\n1 = Observed, but no negative impression\n2 = Remarked upon and had a negative impression\n\nMy answer: 2 â€“ Remarked upon and had a negative impression. The speaker uses negative expressions such as \"malheureusement\" (unfortunately), \"catastrophe\" (disaster), and \"influencer par l'environnement\" (influenced by the environment) to describe the potential consequences of not addressing the issue of fissures in aircraft engines. These expressions create a negative impression and highlight the seriousness of the problem.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,29934,29948,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29896,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,301,29915,4422,4371,316,286,1862,29914,17073,1080,302,2445,5056,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,313,29885,1862,302,2445,271,10270,584,286,585,1564,275,29892,534,9230,29892,2992,29889,12241,302,2445,5056,584,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,282,533,1650,29892,2992,1846,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,4991,1230,316,286,1862,302,2445,271,10270,29889,29871,29896,353,5240,279,17851,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,326,2590,302,2445,1230,29889,29871,29906,353,5240,279,17851,29892,634,18729,263,5246,1597,286,585,1564,895,17188,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1465,443,5541,424,868,286,866,332,270,29915,485,291,29889,29871,30219,29874,8164,7890,1702,13639,4111,262,29889,11948,980,21668,4048,6390,712,7015,5541,1934,3435,3984,267,818,16014,553,758,29884,1960,2535,966,20081,1700,29879,439,29915,2719,437,27649,1223,9945,29889,897,2257,521,542,8164,29899,30001,29899,280,427,7848,1597,6366,6759,1750,8164,626,759,1597,6635,579,1336,354,4191,373,427,263,20737,25456,4439,28661,22527,29889,3872,29883,29892,4239,992,583,1950,29889,997,8861,29892,373,6773,818,6787,533,553,5541,1934,7930,1759,29892,1750,11307,2689,454,772,4841,316,301,29915,485,291,634,12866,872,1136,3011,362,316,1750,269,29915,342,5246,439,29915,265,452,872,277,2331,1841,700,533,301,29915,25049,6693,22004,29889,28944,424,439,29915,585,18997,29915,15669,29892,454,8608,263,4894,264,12450,2016,2298,316,29871,29941,29995,553,904,29885,6847,7398,616,267,316,4810,29906,29889,26079,9397,22759,29892,373,6787,277,553,286,866,1295,818,2258,13876,427,544,27153,22004,5646,427,27510,19505,425,7019,2764,2131,553,1700,29879,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,712,432,29915,1639,29894,993,29889,4526,276,818,2453,1924,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,24209,643,966,1700,17925,29892,454,20299,882,634,454,22591,410,1173,316,425,285,790,545,29889,6803,339,7768,409,13089,357,454,2298,2123,11387,325,568,818,23563,5922,316,872,6316,29973,461,6303,301,29915,13453,3837,2265,610,301,29915,21813,17239,439,29915,309,427,6282,29973,478,681,454,1841,510,558,26477,29973,2581,26099,11643,1189,434,553,285,790,1973,29889,9353,966,5730,5908,4771,316,11643,5458,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,12866,818,1487,12377,749,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,1671,1597,260,8284,316,285,790,1973,634,1750,659,296,818,301,29915,6430,1759,344,332,270,29915,348,818,17256,923,345,1314,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,2181,1318,1597,22577,285,790,545,29892,7847,1444,3911,623,3780,712,553,5855,17899,5056,316,2257,439,29915,1808,2947,1014,381,7628,316,1487,12377,749,29892,634,1444,14111,1487,20299,882,818,425,260,8284,594,352,371,29889,2581,1236,1314,8532,29550,381,443,619,264,2637,966,9201,1775,1608,267,1014,309,2361,316,1487,12377,749,29892,634,1487,20299,882,818,1597,10098,594,352,371,29889,11948,4191,7890,7890,427,270,2663,29920,29892,301,29915,23578,749,302,29915,342,2331,454,20536,2114,5411,1750,1437,8489,457,425,285,790,545,712,301,29915,265,15210,29889,951,22591,1465,27612,24145,285,790,545,707,1700,29884,29892,2947,8648,11469,1597,13500,29892,2257,712,432,29915,9297,347,316,7199,9030,1465,966,7019,2925,10252,3794,29889,8748,1671,18729,29892,980,21668,715,549,261,782,1302,5411,316,425,1775,5289,18934,270,29915,29948,791,2853,966,24610,2637,966,12301,267,29889,438,1481,29892,1444,7890,1223,545,439,29915,309,21668,16454,9291,29915,30001,18916,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,3008,28230,270,29915,348,904,12324,29872,885,7310,1671,3911,9073,9411,7015,4392,575,29889,951,29871,29945,26379,534,265,29889,315,29915,342,443,1035,3610,1064,7289,316,29871,29947,29945,29945,22609,316,5902,535,9625,29871,29947,29945,29945,22609,29892,19172,424,316,6094,29539,553,15570,787,1060,29871,29896,29900,29900,3533,29875,3163,316,10098,2298,17818,344,712,966,12812,7147,270,29915,459,2049,29892,1750,325,609,19397,1020,369,643,425,1775,5289,634,610,425,6701,10039,27282,5644,262,270,29915,262,689,800,1190,454,22591,712,24145,285,790
