The speech is focused on the transformation of the educational system and the role of the teacher in this process. Here is the transcript:\n\n\"I feel like I'm starting my thesis, but I'm also a pedagogical advisor at the University of La Rochelle. As a consultant, I work with teachers to help them transform their practice. But what is the current challenge facing higher education? It's easy to answer, but it's also complex. Our system is struggling to respond to the growing demand for a greater number of students to find employment compatible with their qualifications. As a result, we need to transform our teaching methods. This transformation must be centered on the student themselves, rather than just focusing on transferring knowledge. Specifically, what does that mean? Well, we need to develop active learning techniques, such as project-based work, to help students develop the skills they need in the professional world. There are some innovative teaching methods being tested, but is that enough to transform the system? Certainly not. We need to go beyond isolated initiatives and create a real mass transformation of teaching practices within the institution. And as someone who loves challenges, this is the subject of my thesis. But how can we give students the confidence they need to engage in collective work? My hypothesis is that we need to build trust among teachers and other stakeholders, such as administrators and social actors, so that they feel capable of taking on these collectives. To do this, I create working groups with voluntary teachers and encourage them to work together gradually building a new identity. The problem is that teaching is a solitary activity. So how can we tackle this? My approach is to put people in confidence, so they feel capable of engaging in collective work. I do this by creating inclusive working groups with voluntary teachers and encouraging them to work together towards a common goal. By doing so, we can gradually build a new identity for the teaching profession, and that's where things get complicated. Because I'm also part of the system, you know?\"\n\nFor this analysis, I will use the following options:\n\n0 - Utilization of jargon, argot, sexist/racist terms, or limited vocabulary\n1 - Appropriate language with occasional errors in grammar or usage of jargon/argot, sufficient vocabulary\n2 - High-level language with a wide vocabulary, including idiomatic expressions, imaginative and lively language\n\nBased on the professor's speech, I would choose option 1. The professor uses appropriate language and occasional errors in grammar or usage of jargon/argot, which is sufficient for their message to be conveyed. They also use a wide range of vocabulary, including idiomatic expressions, but avoid using overly complex language that may be difficult for the audience to understand. Therefore, option 1 best represents the professor's language usage in this
