The tone is conversational and engaging, with the speaker using rhetorical questions and repetition to emphasize their points. However, there are some areas where the language could be improved:\n\n* \"Manger 1, dormir, toujours pas, cela fait de respirer, mais pas n'est pas de calère de la plus et non pour l'île\" - This sentence is difficult to understand due to the use of unconventional grammar and vocabulary. A more clear and concise way to express this idea would be \"Eating 1, sleeping, always not, that's what breathing means, but it's not just about being alive.\"\n* \"Ceux qui sont nés à nos verts, je vous prie des lèvres d'amé\" - This sentence is difficult to understand due to the use of unconventional grammar and vocabulary. A more clear and concise way to express this idea would be \"Those born in our town, please donate your lips.\"\n* \"Merci, ceux qui sont nés àilleurs. Merci, vous pouvez me passer de la mêle, maintenant écoutez attentivement\" - This sentence is difficult to understand due to the use of unconventional grammar and vocabulary. A more clear and concise way to express this idea would be \"Thank you, those born elsewhere. Thank you, you can pass me some bread, now listen carefully.\"\n* \"Tout comme certains d'entiment qui ont parcoui des centaines voires des milliers d'éclomètres pouvaient venir à nos verts, les polyor perverser par coulets de centaines d'éclomètres et pour lui d'autant noire\" - This sentence is difficult to understand due to the use of unconventional grammar and vocabulary. A more clear and concise way to express this idea would be \"Just like some sentiment has traveled hundreds or thousands of miles to reach our town, the polyor can also change by passing through hundreds or thousands of kilometers and become just as black.\"\n\nOverall, while the speaker uses a conversational tone and engaging language, there are some areas where the language could be improved to make it more clear and
