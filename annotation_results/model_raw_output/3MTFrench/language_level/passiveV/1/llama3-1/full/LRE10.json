For example, \"Les vaches doivent Ãªtre le faire plus de vos\" (The cows must be made to produce more) or \"Il faut faire plus grossir les animaux\" (It's necessary to make the animals grow larger). While the passive voice is not overly used, it does contribute to a sense of objectivity and clarity in certain parts of the text.\n\nPlease note that I will respond to subsequent questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,757,30179,6960,11,7643,39892,31127,1604,11,4864,348,3023,41098,14707,84788,404,7643,83067,13,34447,5019,16968,39043,11,93569,89,1474,6870,9189,665,89504,56321,4520,13,5034,9517,16588,1826,6316,14701,273,11,6316,14701,273,824,24567,7010,514,356,978,276,12,6496,6953,8288,13,3959,20605,3326,288,11,1744,16968,4864,514,12088,301,11,7591,35124,23577,653,281,32453,376,481,1880,951,628,1154,11,4864,326,41901,94297,274,6,408,494,404,1765,514,274,481,11,3869,220,16,931,220,931,409,16968,88026,3869,81337,11,8065,78060,11,5553,3625,27437,11,46152,69003,306,11,10594,8135,3869,326,6,77492,1291,409,436,556,1880,514,27584,16968,13,80905,92215,5019,61512,274,6,6581,2159,38149,13,2009,38847,3930,426,10515,5898,11,6316,65396,934,80720,39879,361,11,1826,6502,520,2221,11,3625,1179,811,409,1709,48099,2442,98279,9007,21041,13,5034,9517,16588,1826,36897,11,16968,326,6,39883,11,513,71451,436,2642,541,1880,5019,46790,11,42676,1208,293,1082,513,35737,22150,13,19421,1744,66517,1339,2442,80720,3154,519,70412,949,19421,14707,3154,519,70412,5019,51913,2058,45602,11,1208,9517,16588,9517,1517,978,331,1056,1339,13,46408,9517,1517,978,331,1056,1339,3869,4068,51913,2058,20662,65396,13,46408,9517,1517,978,331,1056,1339,3869,4068,48416,8977,829,7591,3825,685,38450,12267,11,3869,4068,40970,63661,3846,934,80720,1615,316,2727,11,1880,81186,665,82620,1208,30029,19076,13,19421,5019,45602,11,3900,47090,71132,1215,3625,31326,1439,5803,1900,7930,5019,969,1188,23761,14843,275,306,1765,326,6,25108,273,9952,3625,594,40751,409,326,6,25108,273,13,5034,3355,23775,712,62301,1826,6316,51651,5803,266,13,46408,25692,23761,54206,3869,31632,409,594,40751,53397,11,272,17771,514,1744,326,6,1334,11,1208,649,818,369,425,324,6033,3625,470,8723,1220,409,1208,649,818,3869,924,846,13,46706,3625,62321,11,951,4046,385,1154,409,4415,24918,3869,951,78199,11,7010,3625,3122,11,27750,78199,15132,459,2542,14014,41199,653,293,37093,13,5034,36679,48468,1826,6502,13535,425,11,15132,3625,26633,33820,4558,2392,409,1208,9517,16588,13,34447,4068,20028,5019,52895,716,20662,4046,385,425,949,19421,14707,11,45602,11,1208,3488,2960,46140,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,27058,4046,43711,65339,265,11,3846,308,17771,6502,1208,1069,483,294,6,14283,48021,951,69236,7010,514,282,3972,12303,13,622,49963,1082,653,704,321,9517,65272,29583,37953,294,52152,5048,1759,13,14465,52571,3869,60946,265,4068,34501,818,1208,1488,20712,712,62301,11,7930,15132,3625,4046,273,588,1759,6033,951,63762,16348,788,11,4068,15132,12,8839,459,2542,14014,949,622,6,391,45808,951,9517,23475,3869,40744,27750,4860,13,4366,1208,1491,19010,8082,11,4864,71925,6960,326,6,49575,3930,21965,3419,409,7591,273,13,1219,2727,834,1339,7043,4196,14081,5512,11,3846,7930,1826,4382,1880,51527,11,10071,3846,7930,1826,4684,76366,1826,304,3395,82585,13,14465,52571,39587,514,49348,26600,285,9465,1208,33818,13109,951,4046,1092,5493,294,49963,5014,1880,1208,91678,367,1913,409,1208,59157,13109,13,62293,3625,76305,75460,3930,25911,11,17317,2624,332,2439,11,5019,7591,23827,261,74940,15132,3625,1097,73511,269,811,63846,17724,13,11876,348,14576,97569,23761,514,20028,5636,409,26317,13,69327,14707,97569,23761,18434,417,5636,908,14014,13,69327,14707,47090,57375,20028,5636,20547,404,3625,4039,12249,949,48109,7591,70,351,2439,51854,1156,10610,10308,409,9904,409,1208,5788,13,10608,414,3869,326,6,8904,324,13,14465,8175,265,3625,1156,10610,10308,7010,1208,5780,11,7930,757,21559,653,35174,409,220,605,8261,11,85114,13519,1759,13,62463,13519,1759,757,29557,376,546,409,7591,23827,261,74940,1156,10610,10308,1880,514,5636,4046,13311,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,13171,294,6,19729,479,261,1208,5788,409,3355,23775,712,62301,409,326,6,1138,344,290,7010,3625,6155,33903,409,326,6,25108,273,13,51223,11600,275,69733,13,1252,11,4864,60946,4068,34501,818,1208,1488,20712,712,62301,409,326,6,1138,344,290,13,14465,1208,71925,6960,9952,1647,6141,3357,324,13,19881,285,11
