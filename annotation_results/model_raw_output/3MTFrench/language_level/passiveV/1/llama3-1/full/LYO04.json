{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T19:22:21.901029184Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcription of public data given in TRANSCRIPT. To do this, note the TRANSCRIPT according to the questions of the QUESTIONNAIRE. For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, 2 with explanations on what these options represent under the OPTIONS section. You must only choose one of these options and provide your answer in the form: Option chosen: 0, 1 or 2; Answer the questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**Questionnaire:** Question 8. In your opinion, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcription's discourse? On a scale of 0 to 2, where:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Transcript:** [See above]\n\nFor question 8, I choose: **Option chosen: 1;**\n\nReasoning: While there are some instances where the passive voice is used (e.g., \"C'est propriété dynamique et élastique.\"), it is not excessive and does not render the text unclear. The speaker uses the passive voice mainly to maintain objectivity and provide clarity on complex scientific concepts, which is beneficial for understanding their ideas.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,36731,2262,294,93825,49733,77558,9189,13,2998,5589,11,4864,514,1446,2192,35597,5636,409,69236,11,66021,1744,2486,467,11,4864,841,41958,665,9467,3095,13,445,88766,258,13,19421,97507,11,17317,74533,409,5636,665,5636,6505,13,48109,17258,85,2439,77411,479,17317,45347,409,27750,20547,288,712,25108,2392,36252,543,8467,11,3625,1860,919,13,27047,2439,45575,934,85217,7710,64,1188,5636,409,48577,1880,409,9517,1072,556,28130,5536,50026,40280,278,13,5034,6425,11,1208,73083,12339,2442,978,13,5031,501,582,8047,76076,40321,1821,665,1089,1291,1370,951,86374,4298,2249,470,81239,29557,409,3625,17634,288,55398,81991,220,1135,4,5636,3625,342,13,3341,326,6,29982,479,12717,409,27750,470,81239,11,272,17771,3930,88247,2428,13,1252,47393,11,6316,1317,361,13826,25108,818,409,22337,20243,2482,3608,8467,13,46706,1647,3851,11,3900,1826,409,1208,8415,97193,951,4751,288,6264,324,66,2205,82,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,934,35329,10878,54961,1370,9517,1335,38094,2428,42676,389,514,74817,68,1880,6316,37291,5906,665,57128,11,3900,841,25692,6502,23761,47086,8047,13,3206,4751,288,6264,324,11,653,3197,409,89869,671,30052,3869,326,6,75876,13,2009,961,274,17771,2080,324,978,11,3900,264,6316,51651,28062,3748,978,30945,2428,1880,32118,4919,2428,13,8560,75876,43765,11,28686,1826,45350,13,3320,1082,324,11,95159,554,11,89869,11,274,6,47314,978,13,34447,6502,409,7363,2428,11,3900,379,264,1647,2428,13,3206,2428,264,20662,6316,47838,8415,97193,409,47393,11,653,4751,288,88247,2428,13,3206,2428,11,21901,11,1826,409,14707,296,26248,2482,32592,3625,2267,1220,409,1208,523,61047,13,62463,264,2442,12,283,30,356,17771,21744,39883,18003,2428,1880,4046,4354,2428,13,1708,1105,11,2267,19941,326,6,8473,91026,1880,628,647,68,2439,7010,28130,528,99481,13,33150,16968,65385,11,28686,1826,1647,2428,15878,8541,306,14707,13,7695,57128,40126,6316,6425,4647,5697,11,12155,21901,1821,11,1344,76544,993,47383,2249,13,34447,39015,11,503,55624,651,1188,13,14465,20605,68,1208,2798,14081,1598,409,28130,9120,593,64380,1604,1880,28686,9517,74972,13,7695,11412,9046,261,27750,22337,20243,2482,11,3625,6316,10253,46106,409,5636,665,5636,83457,11,55398,81991,4846,653,98947,665,56321,15696,13,1252,4751,288,6264,554,11,13552,579,11,93294,13,1708,1105,11,3206,2428,841,513,3288,5636,3869,829,2035,9465,3625,46496,294,6,472,1439,6033,18742,1880,3869,84921,7930,514,9517,74972,13,19421,27549,11412,513,48021,665,30870,273,1880,20028,87938,3869,961,13,19421,272,17771,1370,20662,19266,36235,1744,3206,2428,264,294,6,472,554,264,1862,978,3625,523,14460,13,11842,11,6502,4046,49975,43078,479,32118,4919,2428,13,6178,72,11,31025,484,12339,665,12976,9465,47393,11,4864,52571,3869,6155,9769,1565,326,31769,65272,409,28130,264,46043,85677,361,817,13,14465,94297,11,1370,51173,11,98054,3206,2428,5636,1651,404,5048,13,7695,25400,2322,2221,45889,86696,84989,38094,8467,7930,82133,14707,665,628,12267,28686,13,12095,14707,11,934,35329,11412,1208,22641,261,5636,1317,67380,8065,84364,409,25400,13,19421,45602,11412,6791,20099,1208,62827,951,513,20028,409,3206,2428,7010,1208,6070,28686,13,13789,11,1370,45973,11,503,59858,54606,818,13,7695,379,264,28686,1880,3206,2428,7930,513,35160,306,35597,5019,6316,87810,409,348,87960,409,9517,1335,13,2998,16968,4865,11,5019,2018,8977,3869,91727,3846,38900,8622,52760,7930,17317,1218,80284,13,48109,57038,63669,409,32118,5317,288,294,6,2295,4109,13,9605,3846,45441,9465,47393,7010,951,1860,919,5636,63828,1414,6033,665,490,1143,13,33150,99568,3675,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,586,828,2728,304,41447,25823,13,2057,656,420,11,5296,279,41447,25823,4184,311,279,4860,315,279,91022,7476,7618,13,1789,1855,3488,11,499,617,2380,2671,25,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,449,41941,389,1148,1521,2671,4097,1234,279,52380,3857,13,1472,2011,1193,5268,832,315,1521,2671,323,3493,701,4320,304,279,1376,25,7104,12146,25,220,15,11,220,16,477,220,17,26,22559,
