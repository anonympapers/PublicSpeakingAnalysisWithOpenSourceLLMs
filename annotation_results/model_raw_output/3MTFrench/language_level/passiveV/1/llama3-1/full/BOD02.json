However, I would rate the use of passive voice as 1 (A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity). The speaker does not rely heavily on passive voice, but it is used occasionally to emphasize certain points or provide objective information.\n\n**Example:** In the sentence \"Les celles bilaires serrent et digeraient la nourriture que l'on mange...\", the verb \"serrent\" and \"digeraient\" are in the passive voice, which helps to clarify the role of these molecules in our bodies.\n\nOverall, the speaker's use of passive voice is not excessive or unclear, but rather serves to add variety and emphasis to their message.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,2998,37622,1744,951,4787,11,4864,36731,25945,4747,978,1370,514,80259,62940,532,409,326,6,40057,13,34447,45602,3567,14687,17317,4747,978,26725,1841,75804,88253,8065,5353,409,39043,11,326,6,25632,14081,685,13458,7010,514,64271,409,1208,7187,1826,5636,5590,409,220,605,8261,13,3263,42441,89,90053,409,9189,13,12095,389,841,18728,689,11,220,1644,1034,951,47104,9517,359,285,306,7010,20662,71632,67683,9598,220,605,8261,33670,514,66167,13,220,605,8261,11,272,17771,523,511,276,519,13,7695,47090,294,6,306,15170,818,6425,5019,51913,2058,39043,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,326,54386,52571,3869,46524,653,13550,318,978,4983,2428,11,6316,41675,17317,29557,61512,409,41518,265,409,97418,11,409,296,41901,296,4091,11,294,93825,5636,5052,409,75249,13,3959,297,645,409,1437,1082,89,8437,461,588,11,10071,3846,13550,318,978,4983,2428,308,58736,17194,6502,13,16770,10071,60019,949,19421,4502,4864,9189,834,1744,4864,326,34155,11,665,20272,11,389,1208,26725,296,26248,25108,9258,2957,89,13080,653,13550,318,978,308,59858,4983,2428,13,5034,6425,934,54386,264,26725,11,272,17771,6316,22337,978,3395,7930,274,53149,6853,665,19637,645,20934,17724,13,41621,3665,89,11,272,17771,7010,1208,39973,11,39043,86100,3930,12018,648,13,11876,19637,645,20934,17724,1446,8135,1880,4170,2473,1188,1208,46798,1018,554,1744,326,54386,60534,11,10071,39043,3846,308,17771,6502,43453,13,62293,1647,4046,61673,409,38317,11,17317,57038,59148,1653,1744,3625,19637,645,20934,17724,28068,306,28463,665,436,57332,7010,12155,272,5976,12249,13,2895,66096,3869,326,6,23863,409,21850,606,2605,78,31548,1208,37392,409,1208,75953,72,39883,13,3489,6870,949,1952,312,59976,13,356,17771,29449,272,5976,2933,7930,6155,57332,29449,85424,38450,12267,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1208,1913,1880,1208,75953,72,39883,13,2998,20272,11,389,264,51854,4595,409,21850,606,13,15663,1771,82133,17317,13510,11,503,34155,1913,1880,326,26248,25108,9258,2957,89,6033,1208,48520,66522,13,19421,294,81979,834,306,11,5509,3009,11,5636,63669,409,21273,388,42138,3625,56321,15395,347,4558,6256,505,425,13,19421,17317,11,17317,57038,59148,1653,1744,3625,19637,645,20934,17724,7591,566,268,8696,513,9781,25108,79,546,514,3009,13,2998,59157,13109,11,3625,19637,645,20934,17724,82133,513,5155,261,1765,653,9517,1512,12844,5019,1180,1553,27750,21850,3233,13,19421,76826,11,389,11412,296,41901,296,4091,1880,296,6,351,38315,13,1708,1105,11,4864,9189,100164,96586,13,393,9425,593,389,38682,1130,29449,1486,409,7138,75,1001,665,4197,519,27750,29918,38647,11,87320,3900,379,264,2442,57375,27750,52088,66474,294,6,677,288,13109,949,32429,514,80259,272,17771,934,31109,54613,5945,544,265,665,294,6,677,288,13109,11,11412,2558,556,40970,409,19637,645,20934,17724,934,31109,54613,50590,22299,22419,4725,13,19421,39587,39043,25692,8654,5615,9211,1208,90509,49384,6853,409,3009,13,445,1105,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,7591,6519,919,3869,27138,294,6,677,288,13109,13,14465,36731,13171,294,6,9035,12329,27750,29918,38647,2167,1133,7010,514,272,5976,2933,13,19421,503,41901,834,2852,934,31109,54613,409,1486,25945,76608,13,34447,272,17771,514,436,5615,588,45973,326,6,677,288,13109,13,1708,1105,11,13550,3212,3625,19637,645,20934,17724,5019,16968,514,38900,13,19421,14707,2536,11,3846,308,17771,6502,4502,4382,13,3341,3625,6978,9952,3625,447,2053,4864,42775,273,15878,11,9189,62299,550,49530,949,3959,20897,285,949,507,2005,272,17771,653,46494,1367,14081,3904,278,13,7695,2267,664,969,35597,48488,294,6,4683,65679,7330,52760,13,27058,23761,97717,294,31109,18147,409,19637,645,20934,17724,7010,514,272,5976,2933,11,33670,841,10045,261,6316,76680,4714,648,46206,326,6,87713,13,1708,1105,11,9189,7930,62299,36963,1880,12521,978,11,48041,625,10333,5392,788,7010,1208,38317,5019,79196,52424,27750,220,605,65838,409,17536,40126,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,586,8982,2728,304,41447,25823,4184,311,279,4860,505,91022
