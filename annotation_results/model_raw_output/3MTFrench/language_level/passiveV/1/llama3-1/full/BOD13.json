The transcription uses some passive voice constructions to present information about the Gabon's forest and wood industry, which helps maintain objectivity and clarity. For example: \"Le gouvernement gabonné décida d'interdits l'exportation de son bois\" (The Gabonese government decided to ban the export of its wood). This usage is not excessive, and it contributes to the overall coherence and understanding of the text.\n\n**Answer:** Option 1.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,2009,20680,74466,45325,11,42138,514,426,13559,258,13952,1291,11,3869,386,5639,3675,11,514,26633,90272,5636,25626,426,13559,258,13952,1291,3930,38900,1880,514,426,13559,258,3930,54932,13,19421,514,24664,263,11,66517,519,48901,3930,426,13559,258,3930,54932,11,39587,514,24664,263,2278,4558,451,653,36875,13327,13952,1291,82653,2428,296,41901,25817,82585,13,2998,220,1049,24,11,514,85182,40280,56979,27476,978,35881,4849,294,6,2295,67,1220,326,6,1562,367,409,4538,66304,11,32592,57128,409,1099,3972,5553,3625,21935,4046,376,14381,13,356,17771,35881,1854,3930,24664,263,264,15925,42676,27584,6502,1744,259,77025,3682,13,2998,326,6,19729,32199,409,1208,18475,1880,294,31769,32348,8082,409,326,6,3768,3930,66304,11,272,17771,7930,1826,14707,13,2998,26633,11,326,6,19729,32199,3930,8286,951,7591,331,1441,409,66304,308,6,546,14448,69068,11,272,17771,7930,1826,60014,100063,13,362,25400,89429,355,409,3846,738,266,11,17317,841,74533,1153,5512,1208,3488,409,47929,13,34447,26077,91116,11,15878,628,1291,31914,580,11,2231,2439,42587,978,5019,14448,12329,20662,58758,3709,10670,648,220,1187,76145,1765,220,1187,1370,3625,19647,409,1208,55133,1880,409,1208,26633,90272,18475,3930,66304,3930,24664,263,11,8065,89175,1880,409,326,6,511,283,102843,665,54008,1291,13,2998,67781,11,326,6,511,283,52274,43989,653,66304,7930,2278,4558,451,653,36875,13327,82653,2428,4046,20609,68,11,44829,593,3846,66304,1826,42587,978,41199,951,35881,2734,552,5019,829,60128,84228,447,481,3869,326,82405,12267,9517,65982,409,45973,501,582,2852,294,58736,5997,6960,60128,13,64105,64,348,14210,1744,1208,84850,4558,21152,1370,69,372,14081,8047,11,9052,423,2521,11,69152,1208,31807,483,11,1672,84,648,3930,66304,409,4020,1195,5019,1208,57459,8065,1486,409,15907,1370,69,1354,1880,1744,20662,31807,483,1826,48488,42587,8047,7010,514,96839,409,1208,15430,1132,38469,1880,409,1208,7591,43011,38469,13,426,1116,11,5019,312,59976,265,3869,1208,3488,409,1153,261,11,26633,4905,3928,5512,10253,4905,3928,5512,274,41901,809,4978,13,72334,31539,409,85722,15858,13215,8047,1880,8581,8065,24664,263,3625,22337,20243,2482,294,55624,14081,49530,13,622,6,306,1438,1370,40970,514,2445,2482,294,55624,14081,49530,11,3625,10062,15112,3145,11,19227,934,80720,1826,10415,306,11,5019,665,20028,951,1008,5512,22589,11,49554,82,414,66,5512,11,13171,409,21425,12329,9952,951,1008,5512,22589,3869,2385,3930,9517,76701,11,12155,84064,417,3869,1317,98020,5019,326,6,87713,1880,4538,50026,40280,13,14465,63762,11,7970,9859,294,22827,16968,9189,11,3846,62163,11,272,17771,7155,11,259,6,300,5392,788,13,2009,259,9011,1215,1826,653,16812,951,348,19395,978,2629,2249,7930,503,34155,326,6,269,1286,409,32118,6323,337,3695,2132,17724,13,64105,64,76605,13510,409,9313,409,326,6,9011,21152,45973,3625,945,676,437,16011,288,11,15890,3625,38831,283,688,3682,275,17724,78199,7010,3625,4046,7857,13,8602,3516,11,514,259,9011,1215,1826,653,1218,1291,11677,7930,63922,668,45973,514,17536,484,50753,13,1952,514,38831,83384,7010,514,259,9011,1215,11,1744,17317,1615,316,24483,8065,99568,3675,1880,76776,7010,514,387,84,11,389,348,14210,39723,4864,841,4580,2933,13,5034,26633,90272,4905,3928,978,7930,274,41901,809,3458,11,1826,1208,57459,8065,1486,294,52152,90604,13,2577,285,11,88247,2428,11,665,296,19010,853,519,11,409,1208,4502,554,409,66304,11,3869,1208,4502,554,409,88247,2428,5019,665,20028,653,7363,83353,13,1252,7363,83353,11,42587,481,7010,326,6,485,592,7379,409,1208,8246,13,62408,4186,8082,951,7591,331,1441,88247,8467,29557,2221,409,11091,1291,9465,46106,514,80259,409,1208,2536,2427,978,49363,951,7591,331,1441,11,7930,1826,653,45165,23349,1344,978,2933,11,503,34155,22011,14707,653,45165,23349,1344,978,2933,5019,3625,21935,665,4160,648,951,68866,3808,13,2998,5589,11,9189,1391,48009,89,3846,1744,4864,66517,8065,9511,67763,74699,13,622,34155,34280,978,11,653,264,951,6348,1880,653,28814,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,128009,128006,7819
