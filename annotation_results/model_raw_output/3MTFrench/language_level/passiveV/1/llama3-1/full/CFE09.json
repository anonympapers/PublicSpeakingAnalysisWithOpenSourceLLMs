For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, or 2 with explanations in the OPTIONS section below. You must choose only one option and respond in the form: Option chosen: 0, 1, or 2; Answer the questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**QUESTIONNAIRE:**\n\nQuestion 8: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\n**OPTIONS:**\n\nWhere:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice\n* 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\n\n[Text omitted]\n\nNow, I'll analyze the transcription according to the question above. Based on my analysis, I choose:\n\nOption chosen: 1; Reason: The speaker uses a mix of active and passive voice throughout the transcription, primarily for clarity and objectivity. While there are instances where the passive voice is used extensively, such as when describing the mechanism of the immune system, the overall effect is not excessive or unclear.\n\nPlease let me know
