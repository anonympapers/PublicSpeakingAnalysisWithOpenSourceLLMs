The speaker uses some passive constructions to provide clarity and objectivity in their explanation of their research project. For example, \"l'eau en mouvement vient capturer des bulles d'air\" (water in motion captures air bubbles) or \"le logiciel de simulation que je développe sera amené à traiter des cas industriels\" (the software I develop will be used to treat industrial cases). These constructions help to present the information in a neutral and objective manner, without emphasizing the speaker's role. However, it is not excessive passive voice that renders the text unclear.\n\n**Answer:** Option choisie:
