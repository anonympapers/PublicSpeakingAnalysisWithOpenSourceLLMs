The speaker uses passive voice to provide more context and background information, which helps to clarify their point about anthropology and cultural understanding. Overall, I believe that the use of passive voice is subtle and effective in conveying the speaker's ideas.\n\n**Response**\n\nOption chosen: 1\nCommentary: A little bit of passive voice for
