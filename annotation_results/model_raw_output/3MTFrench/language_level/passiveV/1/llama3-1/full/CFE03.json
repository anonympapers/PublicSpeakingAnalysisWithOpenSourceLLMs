{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T20:13:35.675528259Z","response":"Task: Analyze the transcription of public data in TRANSCRIPT.\n\nTo do this analysis, note down the TRANSCRIPT according to the questions from the QUESTIONNAIRE. For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, or 2 with explanations on what these options represent in the OPTIONS section. You should only choose one of these options and provide your answer in the format: Option chosen: 0, 1, or 2; Answer to questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\nQUESTIONNAIRE:\nQuestion 8: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice\n* 1 = A little bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear;\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n[... omitted ...]\n\nAnalysis:\n\nOption chosen: 1 (A little bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity)\n\nReasoning: The transcription contains some instances of passive voice, particularly when describing the effects of climate change on agriculture. For example, \"Les paysages agricoles changent inexorablement\" can be translated to \"The agricultural landscapes are changing irreversibly\", which uses a passive construction to emphasize the objective impact of climate change. Additionally, sentences like \"On perd des grains\" (\"Grains are lost\") and \"Tous ces grains sont moins remplies\" (\"All these grains are less filled\") also employ passive voice to describe the consequences of stress on grain yield. While not excessive, the use of passive voice serves to maintain a neutral tone and emphasize the objective aspects of the discussion, making it clearer for the audience.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the provided TRANSCRIPT and QUESTIONNAIRE. If you'd like me to revise or expand upon my answer, please let me know!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,2009,2349,11323,266,2428,11,39043,9189,1370,273,11,7970,43029,11,389,1826,665,84871,7836,598,13,64105,64,11412,2109,2540,304,118904,15729,479,29449,76407,409,18434,265,1880,665,54008,1291,409,3846,308,6,3239,556,13,1952,264,26725,46939,33614,951,1615,978,45045,3930,2349,11323,266,2428,11,951,1343,98078,4558,4978,9517,3311,82,1880,4738,812,22299,951,2798,90276,6033,951,19266,331,44357,13,11876,21935,1154,40574,4042,645,2609,306,55981,25745,479,13,27058,12155,55455,3869,79159,11,389,308,26248,56316,24560,28463,81786,1765,88026,1880,1208,7187,62940,20487,3136,294,6,19729,479,261,13,362,9189,2442,12,6853,11,272,17771,6316,304,978,16876,13109,294,69537,12416,10253,594,40751,38450,17724,1880,9189,47592,6316,6671,31807,283,66262,665,8261,949,1708,1105,75249,11,4864,757,5534,2852,9189,949,1708,1105,389,42182,274,6,20311,13,1952,25692,90194,75249,4612,1553,1880,46524,951,4244,35933,7930,274,6,329,391,306,79380,87325,50026,40280,16968,665,390,4120,653,7970,89781,1133,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,6316,3738,68,58617,409,24875,1370,7643,66014,48595,978,13,393,1466,2439,409,1529,978,1370,51173,13,507,2005,11,503,34155,14707,991,501,72,978,13,2998,54008,1291,11,514,1529,978,8541,265,13,15089,294,2182,66021,1744,272,17771,1208,19266,462,6853,1208,5636,27981,8047,1880,1208,5636,1615,20372,8047,7010,514,38900,13,19421,653,35641,409,1529,978,1913,54960,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,272,17771,949,356,17771,294,6,370,541,653,13026,294,31769,45752,1370,7643,48595,978,7930,513,296,6,4112,325,11,44829,653,13026,409,24875,1370,50510,285,13,19421,665,5589,653,69241,1056,425,409,95917,359,409,27750,41936,13,43987,26178,11,13085,89,13,41621,62299,653,51655,326,718,519,294,31109,4244,39883,409,1529,978,13,42215,264,326,6,10796,3993,294,49152,13603,951,50510,285,14295,48488,409,41936,11,26725,409,62827,96642,13,34447,20662,37291,63484,11,8065,4545,951,69241,59307,11,6502,30075,2473,1188,27750,35483,13,356,17771,21965,5019,9189,13,41621,824,87624,951,41936,13,2206,84,9189,62299,653,36875,13327,13,39783,48901,409,26317,41936,35737,25945,69241,648,11,326,49455,265,514,35737,28800,13,650,52262,4160,58504,11,653,35641,3930,308,9769,10367,767,648,1826,14240,6200,8047,11,3869,6316,47838,44397,19395,648,13,445,2005,308,26248,6502,48488,409,24875,1370,50510,285,11,10071,46152,15132,26725,62827,7589,321,17724,13,1708,1105,11,42676,1208,19266,9211,66522,514,550,37093,11,3900,841,41518,6502,409,24875,11,10071,26725,27750,41936,15132,40970,1323,7350,13,1708,1105,11,7930,11,3869,1208,94721,44397,19395,648,11,5019,969,79052,466,514,8631,11,1880,39587,514,17634,1133,514,5636,15528,13,356,17771,3846,1744,503,6,26577,648,409,60946,265,9952,7643,270,4558,325,13,3206,21134,1665,333,11,272,17771,294,57286,664,1291,3625,4244,46500,5512,62827,409,24875,11,1880,409,47929,4502,27549,2605,26584,409,96642,44397,19395,552,409,17317,665,2035,3930,17634,1133,13,3206,26633,90272,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,7591,23827,261,3738,288,4244,35933,11,32592,342,3326,5048,3663,3869,653,8631,42844,28130,991,501,101328,425,409,24875,11,77433,3869,1208,4244,87782,409,62827,409,24875,13,27058,379,75871,265,11,4864,2035,46777,6316,409,27750,4244,35933,7010,6316,3044,7617,1604,11,1880,7010,6316,3044,8631,8047,11,7930,8024,7010,1647,4865,3869,653,38900,62321,11,6033,3869,6316,65058,2798,14081,1598,13,2998,51092,11,4864,84921,5019,46777,4244,39883,1880,7010,3625,26633,4787,11,28130,13026,294,31769,79,1220,29557,73468,48595,978,1880,28130,13026,409,24875,3429,77422,44630,13,2998,5589,11,4864,281,4558,325,23496,77776,26725,3625,41936,951,50510,1220,13,41621,3665,89,3698,3675,39043,264,6800,4046,33686,2067,978,9465,220,1627,8261,11,3869,326,31769,33686,275,2428,11,51854,2606,4918,294,31769,79,1220,409,62827,11,4864,841,326,6,9544,6502,11,39043,20272,48488,294,6,911,1354,13,34447,7970,11,4864,62822,100063,11,1841,22299,22011,11,934,35329,10390,1395,11,389,9517,2119,668,3846,1744,326,54386,
