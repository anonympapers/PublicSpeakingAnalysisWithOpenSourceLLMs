The narrator occasionally uses the passive voice to provide information about Mélanoma's attempts to escape from the body.\n\nThe first instance of passive voice is in the sentence \"Il est enfermée dans ce grand beauté.\" (Mélanoma is enclosed in this large beauty). This use of passive voice creates a sense of objectivity and allows the narrator to focus on the action rather than the agent performing it.\n\nAnother example of moderate passive voice usage can be seen in the sentence \"Les cils comme les trouvent formés sont trop petits pour être vu à l'unut...\" (The eyelashes, once formed, are too small to be seen under a microscope...). This use of passive voice helps to emphasize the physical characteristics of the eyelashes rather than attributing them to any specific agent.\n\nIn contrast, there is no excessive use of passive voice that makes the text unclear or confusing. The narrator maintains a consistent tone and style throughout the discourse, which suggests that the moderate use of passive voice serves the purpose of providing clarity and objectivity.\n\nTherefore, I choose option **1**: A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n\n**Answer:** Option choisie: 1","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,74656,7287,7010,514,83259,1841,51084,46140,13,67440,15265,19266,30362,11,9189,12584,89,91026,951,9527,77,4918,11,19227,645,1744,33919,1901,67824,307,11,445,6,27887,83,24444,818,1880,44031,10946,7942,11,10071,272,17771,294,22827,308,41901,9189,62299,25692,85815,653,4635,84,11,1841,44031,10946,7942,308,17771,6502,3709,6417,39395,326,6,541,68976,13,7695,274,6,74972,294,22827,21497,409,1208,1069,2933,13,356,14140,11,39043,9527,818,1880,653,28800,54008,20712,11,1841,27549,1826,62097,76,8047,7010,653,6800,5017,978,13,24971,514,6800,5017,978,11,16392,11,296,1138,263,11,1744,9189,47592,409,18757,15265,33632,685,13,11842,11,2536,11,2536,13,47643,2005,63484,11,3869,62439,409,76651,11,294,6,58158,1826,409,57128,9952,514,27138,13,2009,9517,1264,519,11,44031,10946,7942,1826,14707,62097,76,8047,7010,20662,9527,1880,308,17771,6502,4502,51794,409,16953,404,3625,296,1759,7930,841,19266,3850,3930,66167,3930,34922,13,34447,16968,22299,3625,72554,11,39043,841,296,6,3342,5615,1557,6502,11,951,19266,4918,13,14465,9189,264,917,43711,31482,11,3900,93569,934,81991,409,514,296,1759,1880,259,6960,409,513,282,1073,1565,7010,951,3775,645,5019,274,31769,331,3183,13,15089,94499,11,665,27584,27138,11,79380,7591,65,1143,11,44031,10946,7942,308,17771,6502,31914,580,13,7695,1826,28463,8811,3869,7118,635,3869,83195,11,7930,22011,11,272,17771,8811,8065,38900,11,45441,653,938,9211,5019,259,1992,409,274,31769,85,1013,13,24703,308,17771,934,6,88423,514,27138,11,934,35329,2322,2221,8065,1486,3869,653,45165,23349,3197,11,951,11028,13,65381,83195,13510,11,26633,6787,12553,306,3284,13,7695,25692,16968,294,6,370,541,75831,951,86696,14726,7930,14848,76190,3869,951,5790,708,447,3916,11,7930,82133,3625,29557,10367,409,44517,716,11,46110,3869,46110,11,514,1317,3930,8309,5019,513,282,1073,1565,7010,3625,3775,645,1880,274,31769,331,3183,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,294,6,266,606,42587,8047,951,4046,70,85798,11,665,20272,13,1952,1370,273,3869,326,6,541,265,409,12172,13,2009,2132,3197,11,25400,6824,68,3869,75831,951,14726,7930,14848,76190,3869,653,11412,1773,454,536,7930,56311,60642,76743,1001,1922,882,1208,1069,2933,11,653,28800,22299,951,281,822,8696,11,1880,7010,3846,4865,11,389,1370,273,409,47289,49241,13,2895,66096,3869,27750,6787,11,11083,20622,23063,25692,934,3328,514,24875,5017,978,1880,48041,71933,294,81979,2942,288,5019,274,59858,44152,1880,274,59858,52895,716,13,74656,97717,11,514,356,513,9527,90083,11,58612,486,2249,665,22848,978,7010,15265,34922,308,17771,6502,5945,98808,481,13,356,17771,5019,45602,934,35329,29253,4046,376,4558,79507,2145,519,3869,8654,5615,9211,3625,11028,409,11083,20622,23063,11,81186,665,14545,31548,3625,4046,331,37907,13,34447,39015,8065,34922,11,11083,20622,23063,1826,28463,85877,6792,302,68,1744,12155,99309,91653,3869,294,83508,783,4978,13,8560,90966,40744,27750,16006,5983,294,31769,59093,11,3869,39929,2442,57375,3136,951,272,4918,409,27750,11412,10145,30,41621,23933,10333,11,9189,11,3625,272,8839,841,5019,9598,5636,75144,3625,4046,331,37907,11,14848,16968,71357,18302,395,978,41869,25843,409,281,822,8696,5019,1651,64,16339,514,8309,13,41621,47592,39587,40970,951,523,4558,75,2439,951,8309,11,10071,9189,47592,5636,409,26483,2396,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,503,34155,9071,978,409,60946,265,4068,11083,20622,23063,7591,73,283,261,3846,89714,14545,31548,3625,4046,331,37907,13,27058,513,20028,11,503,34155,34280,978,1647,83187,8309,11,5636,20028,6316,82711,4618,409,26365,1291,1880,16968,665,503,34155,1651,258,13,14465,7591,2972,11083,19637,645,409,11083,20622,23063,1765,3846,8309,1880,4864,1239,42441,28130,23878,13109,3869,514,7591,911,1013,13,74656,97717,11,3625,272,8839,22299,3625,26483,688,1376,5512,15132,21965,86696,5019,23761,33614,3869,326,22827,332,11,1880,5019,3625,9302,12329,11,503,34155,63669,294,22827,8162,1355,2474,13,41621,9189,7477,375,41881,25692,85815,3930,92622,8162,1355,2474,1744,9189,47592,42587,978,11,603
