For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, 2 with explanations on what each option represents under the subsection OPTIONS. You should only choose one of these options and provide your response in the format: Option chosen: 0, 1 or 2; Respond to questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**Questionnaire:** Question 8. In your opinion, on a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Transcript:** [A long story about Jeanette, a woman who works hard and is affected by her contact lenses. The speaker then talks about their own work on developing a molecule to detect a disease related to aging.]\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nAfter analyzing the transcript, I choose option 1: A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n\nThe speaker uses some passive constructions, such as \"Jeanette est dans la marre de sa condition\" (Jeanette is in trouble due to her contact lens) and \"Vous rêvez que vous enfilez votre blues et que vous sortez votre kit de détection de lentilles\" (You dream of putting on your detective outfit and getting out your contact lens detection kit). These constructions help to maintain objectivity and clarity in the narrative, without dominating the text. The overall tone is conversational and engaging, with a mix of storytelling and scientific explanations.\n\nOption 2: Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear is not applicable here, as the speaker uses the passive voice judiciously and in a way that enhances the story.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,6,2706,81356,9189,15473,444,466,6316,87810,13,62408,87810,11,272,17771,73103,409,20263,6672,13,19421,20263,6672,11,27549,42775,273,10878,13,64105,64,503,41901,16796,59062,978,3869,28800,84364,665,27584,27138,1744,1208,650,9769,10367,11,1370,50590,379,14240,580,409,53050,1880,27549,513,4751,483,11,42676,9189,35881,579,89,409,1208,4864,30872,466,22299,6316,70311,523,12119,751,668,71632,11,66021,1744,20263,6672,11,272,17771,15265,48907,4618,409,3729,13,19421,653,57992,11,20263,6672,1826,7010,1208,3678,265,409,829,3044,409,326,6,306,4618,409,3729,3369,17060,8047,13,19421,27549,73953,7010,653,4499,7010,15265,71632,409,9120,593,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,514,294,20432,13,41621,62299,1206,72671,5512,11,9189,47592,934,31109,6233,648,11,272,17771,294,6,14283,9189,1153,261,77558,15265,47528,1499,3457,12339,27389,69,68862,13,34447,20263,6672,11,27549,1826,39015,11,45889,281,5518,13,7695,47090,48908,1208,23008,9211,13,1708,1105,11,9189,436,5615,19610,1744,9189,665,1213,89,15265,44695,1880,1744,9189,3460,10333,15265,16530,409,7591,40241,409,48907,31355,13,41621,12584,89,68226,665,12025,49120,665,653,28800,961,412,7010,15265,71632,409,9120,593,13,19421,9604,265,1208,41263,20712,13,19421,39015,11,22299,7010,15265,47528,1499,3457,12339,27389,69,68862,11,9189,12584,89,68226,45347,43905,1208,71632,409,9120,593,3869,1208,41263,20712,13,2998,9189,834,519,11,45575,11,934,17771,54312,934,54386,264,30,19421,3399,12584,89,9189,4046,76,5615,9211,32592,26317,20043,2249,11,1167,978,4749,38672,82,11,9189,12584,89,2536,6502,46131,6316,259,9011,1557,409,29340,3869,1370,99746,8065,8309,11,10071,14707,11,20263,6672,13,445,6496,11,282,9769,21152,13,46706,20662,87810,11,20263,6672,1826,3846,934,54386,917,6853,6316,272,1260,6160,1640,2428,7930,1826,4499,84,7010,514,83259,6485,68,409,15265,71632,409,9120,593,13,19421,9189,62299,951,88704,288,13,6178,72,11,503,6,2295,76,3675,5019,274,6,306,49530,12329,13,37407,261,4502,9189,55162,41881,13,3959,704,8839,7930,82133,9189,29557,10367,409,85877,440,261,20263,6672,11,7930,274,17771,20272,1208,8811,13,62463,704,8839,97569,23761,69406,11,22299,6316,41263,20712,7930,293,7379,7010,514,56662,13,469,9112,5118,13559,11,39587,6316,41263,20712,7930,293,7379,12108,13,19421,76776,11,272,17771,326,31769,302,333,13,356,17771,326,31769,302,333,11,39043,76605,13510,934,54386,348,14210,1744,20263,6672,308,96287,6502,1208,15119,49606,409,3091,588,2249,3869,81337,11,66021,1744,9189,47592,1208,282,3516,818,409,18728,4150,308,6,351,404,45441,13,1708,1105,11,4864,9189,1370,273,409,6160,38469,41199,16968,3869,326,6,75876,13,34447,41091,11,4864,36731,38094,17194,13,14465,9765,34395,951,22337,20243,2482,13,19421,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,274,55624,295,12329,6316,22337,20243,2482,11,7930,264,6502,294,6,14283,85877,440,261,51625,285,42625,13,39783,8811,329,648,409,326,6,52822,61480,7010,514,719,7010,1208,94721,1880,514,89714,13,62408,8811,329,648,11,9189,47592,25692,85815,46939,69379,84,89504,665,23933,519,1208,1391,24812,409,6225,31617,8082,3869,1208,43116,9465,26633,50510,15081,1880,47528,13,356,17771,1208,7591,309,978,4355,13,423,19395,32453,676,768,11,7643,11957,12339,11,908,8047,3869,326,6,9011,713,13,19421,5019,1097,73511,15171,514,89714,11,3900,757,47090,26633,79165,13,5034,272,15433,978,27727,11,39587,20263,6672,1880,6502,3625,3091,588,2249,11,1880,653,8450,41263,483,2249,5019,85877,440,261,13,27058,1208,272,15433,978,9035,13109,11,503,34155,4046,501,1412,978,1208,44615,3257,648,1880,6316,22337,20243,2482,3073,5048,1880,594,7003,648,3930,326,93847,13,46408,1826,4635,84,5019,436,69261,404,3625,12104,9769,9004,409,8811,329,648,11,10071,281,14140,554,409,25945,28800,514,66167,3930,34922,13,356,17771,92759,519,5019,41091,66021,1744,39043,76605,13510,934,80720,1826,46939,19266,772,333,13,34447,893,593,409,51527,6033,77818,43765,25692,85815,13,46408,308,17771,6502,41263,483,2249,13,1708,1105,4
