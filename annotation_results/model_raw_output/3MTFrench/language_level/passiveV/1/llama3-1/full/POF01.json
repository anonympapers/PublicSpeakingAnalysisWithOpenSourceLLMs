You must only choose one of these options and provide your answer in the format: Option chosen: 0, 1, or 2; Respond to questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\nQuestion 8. In your opinion, on a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\n**OPTIONS**\n\nWhere:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT**\n\n[... omitted ...]\n\n**Analysis**\n\nBased on the transcription, I evaluate the use of the passive voice as follows:\n\nOption chosen: 1\n\nThe speaker uses a mix of active and passive constructions throughout the transcription. While there are instances where the passive voice is used to convey objectivity (e.g., \"J'ai dit la construction du longage t'écontextualisée en langue française\"), there are also moments where the speaker shifts between different perspectives, using both active and passive constructions to express their ideas. Overall, I believe that the use of the passive voice in this transcription is moderate and serves a purpose in clarifying complex ideas.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,9189,22114,3869,96586,46131,3930,81337,409,326,31769,56745,5634,5571,273,5019,9189,30179,1992,7643,270,4558,325,665,8198,409,326,31769,34985,13,622,34155,9964,22011,1208,8246,3930,1317,425,259,31769,2196,940,285,8047,665,96282,93424,13,46206,3625,60404,14848,65385,409,1208,59157,13109,1765,326,6,25108,273,294,6,50742,11015,11,10071,7010,653,2317,68,8766,3365,8753,9469,2192,6354,3675,11,66021,1744,1765,1647,14701,273,11,514,55467,308,17771,6502,52842,42625,1208,96282,5634,5571,273,13,2009,8859,425,951,66251,285,5512,11,272,17771,514,1317,425,934,54386,69152,81186,5019,3625,12253,5512,951,2267,1220,951,79165,7930,841,15132,6502,30179,812,8065,4545,39723,326,54386,1370,273,13,1398,3342,301,11,42844,6316,4197,13109,11,665,2317,68,11,389,62163,3869,653,33632,519,3846,1744,20272,829,97686,1037,13,7695,75871,11,27549,11,27549,11,550,685,11,1880,27549,2322,39015,13,356,17771,25692,85815,49733,11,10071,3900,20605,265,3625,48577,1880,3625,2909,1441,1880,389,514,60946,66021,1744,3625,2267,1220,15132,665,5542,409,513,7591,583,1565,11,272,17771,3930,8859,425,665,6671,13,362,27389,12,9035,13109,11,60475,2317,68,11,389,25400,62163,409,12253,978,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,13,7695,22011,3869,326,93847,11,16968,3869,326,6,75876,11,294,94572,15273,1208,281,7379,11,1208,1099,48099,1880,1208,628,5048,7010,514,281,9769,13,1952,326,53149,1137,951,48577,1880,951,2909,1441,11,3900,42182,75144,653,8859,425,87451,66251,69068,5636,51625,285,13,27058,62998,274,55624,978,676,261,8065,8859,425,951,66251,285,5512,757,13510,89,9189,30,14751,8246,1826,4043,306,13327,13,3341,16968,8065,1317,409,829,1156,7569,13109,11,653,33013,79351,3567,14687,4046,3415,16339,951,59682,409,5636,665,5636,951,66251,285,5512,409,5636,665,5636,671,496,1339,13,1708,1105,11,4068,91878,12155,60404,3869,514,19477,52750,3846,8859,425,30,393,9425,593,1208,8246,3930,8859,425,11,22299,389,513,86100,294,49152,13603,326,54386,376,978,3869,326,31769,56745,5634,5571,273,11,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,38317,1826,7591,67,664,57567,7591,55923,90859,11,326,6,39883,425,46679,13,5034,85722,15890,3625,6699,88778,306,43153,60404,7010,1208,8246,3930,8859,425,47289,2196,940,69068,13,34447,5019,93381,71933,20662,1665,333,11,17317,3567,2439,5899,404,42463,951,1719,75104,409,15983,511,10745,75,645,52047,645,7930,28068,306,653,436,57332,4043,306,13327,13,1952,1826,20272,3869,326,31769,56745,3625,60404,409,1499,83889,97569,19477,52750,514,8859,425,951,66251,285,5512,665,96282,93424,11,7930,1826,3869,96282,409,326,31769,56745,1880,76076,1719,75104,56311,2018,8977,20662,8246,13,4366,51173,11,1208,51304,17780,361,8065,8859,425,13,35211,288,8689,1499,83889,56311,23761,665,5107,978,2145,12,6496,82489,951,8859,1157,13,62463,2138,31355,7930,841,16456,3458,79738,13080,1208,51304,409,1208,326,5048,7561,38672,82,26584,958,67,635,3869,326,31769,56745,11,8065,97739,9326,409,62891,11,13080,73103,409,1208,96282,93424,11,737,981,978,3869,326,31769,56745,3869,1208,27584,4046,5481,593,1880,14707,27750,2138,31355,56311,27389,69,52424,514,296,19010,853,951,8859,1157,13,4366,51173,11,64972,514,1391,78440,409,4068,3625,6699,88778,306,43153,60404,7010,1208,8246,3930,8859,425,7591,2196,940,69068,13,33150,5363,1880,1719,75104,15983,511,10745,75,645,11,17317,91878,64,3869,945,404,8065,81337,951,2138,31355,5019,1744,3625,60404,11,3869,1208,84143,409,326,31769,56745,5634,5571,273,11,779,1188,7010,3625,79713,4787,5019,917,9484,265,3869,326,31769,56745,11,4864,9189,312,1195,25134,11,7643,554,817,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,27671,4096,334,198,198,6396,25,38527,3059,279,46940,2728,304,41447,25823,3196,389,279,4860,315,91022,7476,7618,627,198,2520,1855,3488,11,499,617,2380,2671,25,220,15,11,220,16,11,323,220,17,449,41941,1234,279,52380,3857,13,1472,2011,1193,5268,832,315,1521,2671,323,3493,701,4320,304,279,3645,25,7104,12146,25,220,15,11,220,16,11,477,220,17,26,40633,311,4860,304,279,2015,814,5101,3
