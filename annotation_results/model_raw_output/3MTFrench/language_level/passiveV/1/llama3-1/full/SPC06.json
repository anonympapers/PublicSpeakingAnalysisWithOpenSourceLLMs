For example, \"L'hypertension artérielle, c'est lorsque la pression d'en vous vaisse aux éthropélevés alors que vous êtes au repos.\" This use of the passive voice helps to clarify complex medical concepts without emphasizing personal opinions or biases. However, the speaker also uses other sentence structures and tenses, which prevents excessive use of the passive voice that might make the text unclear.\n\nPlease note that I only chose one option and provided my reasoning under this analysis section.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,20662,71632,11,6316,54613,1765,56321,1826,4747,8047,1370,326,39982,1100,531,2711,1989,28154,6853,13,24971,409,7363,2428,11,272,17771,6316,52138,26193,93424,13,34447,272,17771,5019,9189,1647,95920,1744,20662,8811,329,648,15119,1557,4046,20609,42625,409,48577,13,445,39982,1100,531,2711,1989,28154,6853,11,272,17771,87158,1208,3577,290,294,41901,9189,91507,325,10253,4046,98643,978,3532,5512,45575,1744,9189,62299,8065,46874,13,9424,688,20662,8811,329,648,1826,294,30872,3869,51854,2144,38647,409,10025,593,13,445,9011,713,11,1208,272,15433,80780,13109,11,4502,9189,60534,89,21965,274,65948,8047,11,665,9517,1264,978,11,272,17771,665,34501,409,15265,3941,409,17536,1880,409,26317,3276,59457,812,2138,34429,13,34447,11,7010,220,605,4,951,4865,11,272,17771,294,30872,3869,96642,8811,17491,13,19421,4864,296,55624,978,22550,5636,54008,67882,3869,326,22827,294,80720,13,2998,27138,4725,11,1208,3577,290,1989,28154,6853,1826,38682,360,8047,1370,6316,36908,7930,274,53149,6853,326,6,4852,537,978,2298,11,7930,1826,2558,635,1370,6316,38920,2840,6960,7930,513,71451,8065,89429,355,3930,54821,11,1208,2840,6960,1765,9517,77,1604,13,445,6,4852,537,978,2298,29557,294,6,19729,479,261,1208,3577,290,7010,9189,91507,325,10253,781,285,934,6,37907,98004,325,11,3846,7930,29557,409,5088,268,404,6316,3577,290,1989,28154,6853,4725,13,34447,7010,1208,8811,329,648,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,326,6,329,537,978,2298,1826,2558,635,665,11885,768,15878,75103,1370,6316,15756,554,13,39783,15756,554,90551,7907,11,2536,58612,486,817,11,7930,513,52895,375,7010,1208,2840,6960,1765,9517,77,1604,13,27058,47929,87320,1880,4068,20662,15756,554,513,52895,375,11,503,34155,14240,21178,978,220,20,8261,409,4502,9964,757,1759,17033,519,409,11939,13,19421,503,34155,5363,978,409,75249,46152,15132,40321,5512,13,27058,39043,11,503,34155,5906,409,1208,76651,1765,20662,15756,554,13,19421,39043,21559,39043,13,356,17771,65285,266,11,20605,265,1744,27750,9964,757,1759,15132,40321,5512,409,96642,2849,2482,13,19421,1744,4502,272,17771,326,31109,841,2558,635,6502,409,43905,409,1208,49415,978,2298,13,1708,1105,11,503,34155,55162,10036,47929,87320,4864,22842,20662,4046,466,12184,10610,13109,13,19421,503,34155,11741,1339,1208,15922,951,2849,2482,29465,4282,7930,2558,285,306,409,326,6,329,537,978,2298,1880,951,2849,2482,67861,7930,841,2558,285,306,6502,294,6,329,537,978,2298,13,622,34155,9466,978,951,34684,7010,1208,15922,13,356,17771,27472,11,10071,272,17771,87320,3625,2849,2482,29465,4282,2558,285,306,665,11885,768,409,326,6,329,537,978,2298,13,4366,45973,11,1880,841,296,6,30992,2428,6502,87320,11,503,6,49133,951,2849,2482,29465,4282,1880,67861,7010,27750,9964,757,1759,13,4418,66,503,34155,63669,409,5636,294,6,15336,5019,47929,4068,27750,9964,757,1759,513,52895,375,13,356,17771,5019,39043,1744,4864,91507,20662,37291,63484,48908,5636,78060,13,19421,8065,39381,409,5363,261,653,57951,409,2849,2482,11,4864,91507,5363,261,3625,2849,2482,6316,264,360,13,14465,91507,5363,261,653,528,57663,409,46777,2849,1130,13,24703,7930,11412,757,29557,10367,294,6,677,2002,404,5636,294,6,15336,1880,409,25692,85815,60946,265,4068,513,52895,375,27750,9964,757,1759,13,24703,7930,1826,436,395,324,519,9952,20662,8811,329,648,11,272,17771,1744,5019,1709,14081,404,11,3900,8657,275,70374,7010,514,348,49530,20662,9964,757,1759,13,34447,25692,85815,513,45347,951,46415,39929,951,65838,33670,1744,9189,13510,1744,12155,34240,20662,8811,329,648,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,3625,18713,3012,47357,13327,645,1826,5542,14014,3663,8065,45369,3930,27138,13,12623,9189,35456,23577,3930,27138,5019,779,78756,20662,8811,329,648,1880,5636,9189,49806,261,3625,10025,14295,409,20028,653,1860,434,978,6033,653,3611,472,355,13,4418,66,3900,47090,945,404,83457,13,19421,11083,100246,5019,969,1188,29557,10367,409,9517,1072,556,514,27138,409,1891,8372,2428,1880,25692,85815,665,12306,409,46524,409,87325,9781,1224,812,13,2331,1
