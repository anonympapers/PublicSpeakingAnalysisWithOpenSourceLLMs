These examples demonstrate a subtle use of passive voice to clarify or present information in an objective manner. However, the overall discourse is not dominated by passive voice, which prevents me from choosing option 2.\n\nPlease note that I only provide one answer for each question, as instructed.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,841,63762,6502,4502,9189,3665,89,11,41091,4864,326,34155,917,6091,665,27389,1768,519,1647,2624,2530,409,20662,86323,11,10071,20662,17571,409,523,13559,324,294,6,52009,1759,41091,11,274,53149,6853,653,348,2881,526,361,13,24703,17779,409,326,6,14310,1516,11,3900,308,41901,29253,7010,26725,3625,21935,11,7010,40744,3625,8859,1157,13,4072,645,14848,43905,1208,27584,4040,13109,13,356,17771,409,3429,66014,79380,51794,3869,78551,8065,21134,671,541,11,10071,294,93825,54008,67882,77411,3869,19126,263,3913,3869,62321,409,4160,648,13,14465,757,36731,17634,84,42463,1744,3846,7434,17258,85,1339,513,436,16082,9211,409,84753,951,35030,292,24469,13,41621,379,47592,6502,514,39474,11,4864,91507,9189,3327,72684,87320,13,445,1105,593,389,1826,8811,1037,11,389,35456,29449,35030,292,2908,11,389,326,26248,6316,49904,265,11,304,283,3209,519,11,1880,389,25692,2018,8977,514,45369,409,12155,5891,552,68040,1001,51794,13,34447,1370,86633,326,41901,3078,3930,75211,1826,48488,5636,6485,68,13,3341,514,5636,71151,11,3625,67965,2053,97569,20028,3663,3869,409,13026,4881,665,3841,2249,1880,81186,514,5088,3675,409,1208,28062,3748,978,951,22337,20243,2482,7930,82133,23761,7591,34667,43711,10253,6978,13,14465,757,10219,265,5636,54008,67882,1765,653,955,409,22337,20243,2482,11,3625,88143,494,288,12155,67007,13,11876,88143,494,288,11,272,17771,78422,532,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,1744,42676,389,3625,264,6316,49904,265,11,3900,841,4160,275,23761,13171,409,16456,3458,66014,3625,2849,2482,8811,3536,7010,29449,34922,11,1370,51173,11,951,2849,2482,9572,4881,1880,3625,4046,4763,10670,16968,665,30179,651,519,3625,2849,2482,1156,4558,4978,13,356,17771,39587,951,35030,292,24469,9952,653,25945,12108,36875,13327,11,1841,46152,15132,25945,31914,2492,11,9952,25945,28800,951,66079,46838,404,4893,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,934,35329,47090,5088,268,404,28130,6070,3003,20487,13,27058,757,60946,265,3846,7434,11,4864,91507,757,9517,69,52424,409,87325,348,552,3869,1317,1157,2761,65220,41091,13,12095,4864,19126,13486,1370,51173,11,653,52571,324,523,3675,11,4864,36731,653,52571,324,523,3675,11,46939,29449,958,71,1791,40095,1826,10025,593,294,93825,1522,481,479,46838,404,346,2933,38605,13,19421,665,5636,11,389,11412,41518,265,514,6225,409,29449,17571,13,19421,5019,3625,88143,494,288,11,272,17771,24068,321,13,12095,389,41518,1208,6070,3003,20487,409,1208,22337,20243,1130,11,389,41518,4538,6225,11,389,41518,4538,4197,13109,13,14465,757,10219,265,5636,54008,67882,1765,3625,25066,13,39783,3834,11,39043,11412,7591,4763,2058,220,17,7625,53819,7930,841,513,296,19010,853,6502,13,1219,2727,1370,51173,11,1208,6425,294,6,17555,292,269,7930,1826,2761,65220,41091,1826,514,39002,294,31109,25551,876,4091,13,33150,53052,409,27750,25066,11,3625,88143,81875,82133,68226,41518,265,28130,6070,3003,20487,11,4046,68019,951,514,38448,9952,1208,7479,13,19421,39587,11,41518,265,28130,6070,3003,20487,13,1952,25692,436,16082,9211,3846,1343,98078,48099,2922,6496,3930,348,2881,526,361,2761,65220,41091,11,9952,3625,51923,4558,4978,66056,1880,66056,7930,15132,16968,54008,67882,61907,3742,3869,19126,263,3913,13,19421,1765,3625,447,2053,653,44521,2070,324,27584,1367,12339,40142,3930,8811,3869,6316,11091,631,978,13,14465,9189,296,1441,294,6,52009,1759,8065,7591,10188,294,6,337,20028,13,19421,39587,11,5019,6502,13510,3869,3846,80259,951,326,6,14310,4065,9952,514,348,2881,526,361,11,389,25692,1370,86633,20028,76190,3869,653,30299,94906,17194,7930,5019,969,17317,91878,51854,893,59307,13,1952,264,57485,951,5554,2436,9465,46777,3937,5019,98054,514,2624,2530,5636,1344,3422,13,1952,665,58424,635,665,326,6,81987,2987,1370,51173,13,19421,14707,409,1208,27584,85722,11,3625,67965,2053,82133,26514,2743,11,45575,35030,292,24469,11,951,16006,288,779,533,22589,7930,82133,841,13080,1798,13052,12329,1208,22337,20243,1130,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,934,54386,841,829,275,6502,60019,4068,46152,8213
