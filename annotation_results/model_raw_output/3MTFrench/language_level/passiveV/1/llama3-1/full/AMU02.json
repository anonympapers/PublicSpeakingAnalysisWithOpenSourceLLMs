You must only choose one of these options and provide your answer in the format: Option chosen: 0, 1, or 2; Respond to the questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\nQUESTIONNAIRE:\nQuestion 8: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\nOPTIONS:\nWhere:\n0 = No passive voice.\n1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n...After my high school diploma eight years ago, I chose to listen to my heart. Thank you very much, Mom-Dad. I wanted to become a doctor. I had stars in my eyes and rocks full of arm-harps. Already as a kid, I was curious about meteorites in the dark sky. Garoboli! I used Theroyd that orbits far from home. But sometimes, rapid fragments fall suddenly on Earth. Airange that percolates through the soil, the most common ones weigh heavily. But in this oval song, we'll just say it's summer, horite, Garoboli!\n\nThe problem that concerns us among our friends and acquaintances is not where they fall, but the steroids that inhabit them, so to answer the question, we need to take a spatial perspective, which may cost quite a bit, even if it's less clear, friscal. Garoboli! The asteroids are light, unlike large planets, their heart has not liquefied, preserving their history, which lasted for five billion years, they remained as a heritage, the only one showing how the solar system formed. It is time to put on the table the means my thesis proposes. Let's see if they are affordable with the rhymes I've imposed. Observe at night or walk in plain sight, let's see that I have chosen for it to be clear in this art noise? It is in the vastness of the air, it is far from any alteration, that fragments of the solar system repost in complete discretion. Without animosity, or pain, once I return from my hunt, I'll start my inhuman science, I've mortified it, I've shattered it. Always in my laboratory, I've filtered it, I've dissolved it, I've dated without making a fuss about the fall on Earth of its cailloux. The results I found confirm what we suspect, the steroid is battered victim of numerous blows. It remains to find the steroid that will crush us with a thousand fragments. In this kinship resides, the genesis of the distant star. To find this filiation, one of the methods I develop is the study of deep craters on an enormous telescope, Garoboli.\n\nMorality of this story, if memory fails you, it's that the earth is the mirror of mysteries and what is up there. As for the question that burns you, about the reason for this range, I like when in recentness this bouscule, it's the Cartesian maphology, Garoboli.\n\nOption chosen:
