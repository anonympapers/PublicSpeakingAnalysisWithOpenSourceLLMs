The transcription uses some passive voice to provide objective information, but it is not excessive. For example, \"Les grands gardent mieux la chaleur que les petits\" (Large ones keep better heat than small ones) and \"La taille va changer tous les billons énergétiques\" (The size will change all energy billions). The use of passive voice helps to present scientific information in a neutral manner.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,9880,11,389,84228,447,1339,1744,39015,39723,3900,20272,70412,11,653,10065,39015,3122,1826,71151,40970,25500,11,71151,46206,3625,102878,1394,12249,6033,35597,46206,3625,36041,333,31539,11,864,55506,1474,5615,9004,1370,51173,653,4411,346,25685,13,66090,4502,1826,5636,25500,1744,4538,36271,665,8811,329,648,11,39043,272,17771,653,51173,11741,23034,10071,39043,15572,68,49733,11,653,85059,98477,97262,321,11,39723,3900,20272,653,46110,41675,11,35737,40970,25500,1744,4538,8941,9859,321,379,264,409,1208,16578,13,24703,308,17771,6502,6316,3190,24812,409,27389,7611,45973,3625,924,846,324,285,1880,1208,83229,3491,409,31782,1543,11,665,6160,41632,3257,2428,11,3900,22011,1744,3625,94527,22641,306,64972,1208,523,61047,1744,3625,86696,13,4418,66,11,3900,20272,70412,1744,9964,1560,21965,25500,13535,44618,6316,17508,5098,648,13,622,41901,16796,20272,326,6,4683,65679,11,259,1188,6502,5636,62197,934,39982,1291,11,7643,259,13559,409,4865,11,58482,88684,8065,3116,67,2428,11,514,83457,1744,1208,4865,9314,12339,13,4418,66,11,951,4046,19926,4751,8467,11,39015,4864,9189,1370,273,409,64441,11,10071,3900,29253,28463,951,2144,38647,6160,1640,8467,11,7010,514,48734,11,42676,326,77492,3460,11,3900,20272,653,13091,285,19266,85,12339,13,7695,379,264,5636,294,22827,4315,978,11,39587,9964,757,1759,665,305,1553,11,10071,4502,9964,1560,5636,6800,11,9964,439,5636,409,31807,13583,11,25692,85815,1744,1208,9964,7550,648,8941,34922,1880,9964,841,100164,409,1028,78548,13,1611,326,31769,447,11067,5553,3625,17258,645,11,4502,503,34155,14707,13550,285,11,272,17771,326,98279,12214,1291,6155,57332,1880,274,35329,20272,282,47789,361,6800,1773,978,13,34447,5019,934,35329,379,264,653,274,15433,5898,11,4864,9189,1370,273,409,39043,75804,88253,13,14465,9189,1370,273,294,31109,1206,978,1474,373,11,10071,76776,409,2798,14081,1598,13,41621,3665,89,25692,85815,1744,514,1206,978,1474,1815,12,853,1826,1744,3625,27138,15132,10878,1744,20272,1208,56594,1986,13109,2267,355,751,11843,57733,11323,266,2428,11,1880,14707,39043,7591,3825,1339,15907,16948,4558,1634,1370,86633,272,17771,13859,266,2428,13,39783,3488,5019,23589,265,4068,46524,3930,282,1607,13,4418,66,11,30870,713,2439,5553,514,48734,11,39043,35737,40970,70412,39015,1481,300,13,19421,4502,1208,55133,951,9517,23475,2609,14014,409,2035,11,1208,56594,1986,13109,9517,23475,665,2349,519,7010,326,77025,1330,11,10071,4068,4864,66517,949,12095,4864,841,94297,6502,30870,1414,13,29749,308,6,300,934,81991,7591,5531,978,6316,9637,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,11,1208,296,2227,354,11,1370,51173,11,66517,1355,57288,21901,96308,13,2009,92942,523,13559,2231,569,7010,326,6,48029,4618,5019,523,3376,951,296,4618,2922,6496,13,19421,272,17771,1208,26633,90272,951,9517,23475,8065,9517,76179,1133,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,9517,23475,665,2349,519,7010,514,27138,13,14465,94297,14707,13510,514,85059,2427,6809,10071,13510,653,490,1791,7930,296,6,73,26248,547,13,11583,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,11,40574,525,1880,294,41901,83791,48099,11,665,5636,11,7643,47276,11,1647,39646,1826,49733,13,64105,64,841,87264,6502,5636,4382,4502,503,31769,2629,285,70374,5636,46110,13,19421,4502,1208,8348,13532,25253,951,9517,23475,513,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,11,1208,56594,1986,13109,9517,23475,7010,326,31769,49938,519,4046,39624,99188,11,1880,272,17771,3846,1765,75249,5019,1028,48021,3869,15265,38317,13,1952,829,275,74699,1744,11323,266,1826,1208,62827,11,4538,409,296,4558,1557,11,10071,4502,514,1206,978,1474,1815,12,853,7010,514,27138,13,11876,4039,12249,82133,12,8839,62439,409,62827,5019,3154,519,30,27058,514,47929,11,503,49963,1082,653,51655,409,46681,38883,13,11876,3122,98733,17724,7930,757,1759,77065,951,297,1082,12249,7010,43905,1208,9822,13,11246,92759,519,11,272,17771,57375,3460,409,46110,1880,6800,11,10071,5019,1208,56594,1986,13109,3930,46415,665,75249,272,17771,3062,30,19421,14707,11,665,272,17771,27138,409,25626,23851,11323,266,2428,11,120
