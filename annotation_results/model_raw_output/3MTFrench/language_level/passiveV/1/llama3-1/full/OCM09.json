{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T18:34:48.274312473Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcript and evaluate the use of passive voice in the discourse.\n\n**Question 8:** On a scale of 0 to 2, how would you rate the use of passive voice in this transcription?\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Analysis:** After reviewing the transcript, I noticed that the speaker uses a mix of active and passive voice constructions. While there are instances where the speaker takes an active role in describing their thoughts and actions (e.g., \"Je reviens de Camargue...\"), there are also moments where the focus shifts to the described events or processes, which can be considered as passive voice (e.g., \"Monsieur Favre veut que son orie grandit...\" or \"La protection contre le blast, et l'angétration a zothé. Il doit rester prudent.\"). Additionally, there are sections where the speaker appears to adopt a more objective tone, using passive constructions to describe phenomena (e.g., \"Ce qui peut se traduire par l'exposaire de riz expiscite, non?\").\n\nConsidering these instances, I would rate the use of passive voice in this transcription as **1**. The occasional use of passive voice does not detract significantly from the clarity or objectivity of the text, and it is often used to convey information or describe processes rather than obscure the speaker's intentions.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,16770,11,44451,1880,386,26169,2428,13,14465,5891,80463,409,8215,867,361,11,1880,272,17771,39373,265,15286,978,7298,665,4538,33537,978,3869,272,89412,7802,648,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,42676,4864,9189,834,8215,867,361,11,39043,9189,4046,3415,593,13,507,2005,11,7970,3625,386,26169,8467,11,10071,272,17771,28463,409,8622,52760,21935,425,11,9952,27750,74599,461,99262,3091,6723,2249,11,27750,5801,12249,11,1880,27750,10025,59307,11,1880,1120,1133,11,7643,270,4558,325,60172,1765,326,6,30303,13,34447,5019,64972,9189,665,89504,11,4864,91507,9189,15473,444,466,326,6,90446,409,50601,62005,82041,265,11,432,5512,3951,12844,8215,867,361,13,42759,16870,78,1880,2947,22144,445,519,11,50601,62005,82041,265,11,4612,333,4538,477,648,11,4538,1665,333,11,39929,1208,94721,1880,14480,3284,13,27058,39043,11,3900,6590,22550,4538,477,648,11,9952,409,326,6,526,14687,11,665,342,2827,934,35329,687,1188,653,33013,42625,25945,3062,11,326,6,1394,1295,13,50601,62005,82041,265,76605,1744,4538,477,648,6800,275,11,272,17771,3663,48488,294,97670,1354,11,272,76832,9952,653,8187,294,6,1394,1295,11,3488,951,4635,336,285,11,1880,30179,8943,326,41901,2842,40280,13,1611,5636,11,3900,264,1760,19395,978,829,83052,3663,3869,1208,8811,329,648,11,1208,5636,1448,978,447,6960,1880,7591,85,561,68636,3930,436,450,13,62408,8811,329,648,1826,3930,653,35641,62799,11,389,326,53149,301,514,20228,21327,13,24703,7930,25692,513,4790,52750,1370,326,58736,981,12267,409,436,450,1367,3510,635,11,2536,30,50601,62005,82041,265,11,39587,503,34155,9517,4338,288,3869,3846,64032,3825,44186,13,5034,9313,45973,514,21327,11,1880,326,6,526,978,376,367,264,1167,8942,978,13,7695,42182,2800,261,74978,13,3341,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,25540,5512,1370,42067,1367,1497,324,11,15132,1437,16382,1001,264,36490,978,3869,1208,16578,294,31109,36214,8082,3869,1167,8942,978,13,1252,28800,22299,4502,3625,296,26169,8467,409,259,6181,556,11,39043,1181,77,1339,5636,1765,41091,11,42138,4864,757,5945,10176,729,934,35329,379,50590,3930,924,846,324,648,13,362,32384,11,37953,294,31109,4046,10629,17060,648,11,4502,757,513,282,525,8065,36214,285,653,28800,21965,369,79507,11,3900,10025,593,409,41518,265,43905,829,9517,2119,668,13,46706,653,4865,22299,39043,11,3900,513,38831,83384,77558,653,17475,978,294,35329,467,13,6178,72,11,4864,5320,2249,6316,51651,16536,4618,1400,668,11,10071,1647,74206,33013,42625,11,39587,4864,36214,1082,13,507,2005,11,10071,9189,10025,42221,294,31109,25176,8811,329,648,13,16770,97507,11,9964,439,73173,13,61651,14707,11,4864,44521,1339,934,81991,18027,261,9952,3625,82134,54021,13,11842,11,10071,3900,47090,23423,261,50026,40280,11,16968,39043,11,23933,10333,13,16770,6033,2852,11,9964,439,73173,13,13789,11,36346,14707,11,6502,1208,1167,8942,13,16770,10071,39015,11,9189,12584,89,41518,265,665,1925,13,1952,25692,523,554,11,10071,4068,4864,66517,1880,41091,11,15878,7970,1215,261,1400,668,11,4864,36731,3869,326,6,1138,361,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,9964,30714,949,61651,14707,11,10071,58673,2249,11,409,21901,82,23423,14014,13,9605,87158,1208,628,5048,60534,1208,1167,8942,42676,25400,21559,11,27549,1826,38605,9993,1604,11,6316,80444,294,6,347,12267,13,2009,35641,62799,35737,45575,13171,409,1344,52424,20662,73994,324,11,7930,25400,1280,72684,1339,1744,1208,628,5048,1826,77433,1880,3869,281,10515,1056,5048,13,19421,272,17771,3846,934,35329,842,81,8047,48488,5636,945,676,333,13,3206,30870,9363,6824,68,3869,13110,20662,73994,324,13,27058,76826,71132,1215,951,4244,10515,5512,294,39982,19395,4108,11,7930,841,1208,2558,556,1339,6502,11,10071,7930,264,48681,978,5019,4046,76,4091,326,6,300,46223,265,42676,326,6,22231,818,1880,514,25500,28146,409,85722,1744,8657,285,5048,11,5019,1744,757,513,282,525,1880,9964,841,9517,2119,668,3869,1647,842,13,426,1116,11,16968,39043,11,5019,29557,10367,3869,757,513,282,525,409,2018,8977,3869,463,2203,52424,11,665,27981,519,20662,47528,3869,514,296,4618,4046,1215,11,
