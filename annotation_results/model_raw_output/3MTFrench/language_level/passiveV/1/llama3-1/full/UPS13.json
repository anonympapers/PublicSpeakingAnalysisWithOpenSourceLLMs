(Options: 0 = No passive voice. 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity. 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.)\n\n**Option chosen:** 1\n\nThe speaker uses some passive voice constructions, mainly to provide information about events or processes rather than emphasizing their own agency. For example, \"le vent souffle déchénée la pluie glacial\" (the wind is blowing fiercely and the rain is glacial) or \"les capteurs s'affaulent\" (the sensors are malfunctioning). These constructions serve to clarify the situation and provide objectivity, rather than hiding the speaker's involvement. Overall, the use of passive voice in this discourse is not excessive and does not impede clarity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,11,4864,36731,38077,20198,425,1880,4864,9189,31025,4618,409,9189,1046,299,9211,1841,9189,4046,3532,74466,45325,3869,11083,72070,5512,11,7643,270,4558,325,665,220,5245,2132,288,11,4068,15132,1370,1208,1913,949,29083,9952,41091,37953,409,1208,88818,14240,2070,3930,46494,95199,268,11,21120,33538,5754,11,17317,74533,665,220,508,508,1765,6316,20605,24812,3869,5636,409,220,914,410,296,75104,11,514,10594,5945,544,273,7591,331,10610,8047,1208,121696,648,2840,33211,11,23828,8047,7010,29449,671,462,1880,61387,8047,11,17317,4046,6232,2439,514,1437,3159,1327,35285,554,274,55624,729,3125,11,3625,2107,668,1759,274,82405,5049,306,11,1208,24408,20605,68,11,272,17771,514,4545,17634,519,3284,326,6,6802,9769,2641,13,3489,6870,665,20272,949,14465,841,348,11206,2852,6502,35597,13510,11,29449,719,35737,4382,11,6155,9769,1565,1208,282,3023,265,758,12535,9189,7631,10333,39043,949,61651,14707,5019,3846,20028,11,7930,259,6,546,1208,20605,24812,3869,1323,546,519,514,27138,5019,514,65385,409,7643,270,4558,325,87158,503,34155,100162,1208,90509,9952,653,21120,13,2009,82660,3527,409,9840,425,409,1208,282,3023,265,1826,294,49963,12329,653,21120,4502,653,27138,934,35329,379,264,6316,21120,1765,4538,21765,11,34280,519,6316,15235,818,409,32426,5019,82810,10515,408,265,3869,5636,294,31109,2960,8511,409,296,75104,13,24703,32426,11,31807,360,51137,665,653,40021,294,6,1334,32592,1773,685,9952,41091,409,79165,7836,598,11,514,39474,9952,3625,951,10405,13,61651,14707,11,272,17771,1744,3625,10405,98151,462,14295,15132,653,28800,22299,17317,13,4072,645,308,6,2706,306,14707,841,6502,23761,14545,64591,66021,934,35329,264,77558,27549,1880,76776,84568,15132,4905,16156,288,13,4418,66,13085,89,45325,11,934,54386,264,9071,978,294,41901,7591,65,3102,2439,45575,1744,9189,62299,3577,978,11,107954,467,1133,11,934,80720,16869,9008,653,21120,1880,7558,519,1208,3682,13109,951,4160,42204,1765,1208,4160,648,294,69537,35657,978,13,41621,12584,89,9189,379,51625,575,2058,11,2536,949,7777,97507,11,9189,12584,89,9189,379,51625,575,2058,13,19421,3625,10405,98151,462,14295,409,326,6,2747,23828,4558,8135,7010,28130,11148,425,11,389,20028,409,27584,513,51625,575,2058,7010,1208,5216,1744,4864,28130,21559,42676,4864,28130,21559,13,19421,4502,45602,1826,20272,11,272,17771,86966,13,41621,9189,436,74466,76385,978,1208,282,3023,265,87451,934,80720,1826,57485,11,39015,39723,9189,55162,41881,409,27389,59958,16271,653,842,69596,69241,72,409,2107,668,324,1880,76776,326,6,3342,5615,9211,409,55035,1765,3625,26467,3869,1760,978,1414,13,34447,4864,3355,729,294,49963,12329,514,3044,8301,11,9189,264,68490,84228,16339,13,3341,294,6,370,541,11,9189,12584,89,409,35573,4287,261,409,45347,56321,8261,9952,41091,3869,58673,15610,13,24703,308,17771,6502,4502,4382,409,1709,1814,1208,282,3023,265,13,1952,4046,61673,42775,409,31837,41199,5636,409,220,868,8261,11,10071,20662,37291,11,27549,264,9517,3928,3625,8232,77660,11909,21120,11,34280,519,665,25018,220,18,220,931,37291,5636,18757,1056,1821,1744,514,62891,842,63734,13,3959,11909,665,36252,89577,2322,73468,653,72601,5019,11083,7889,16968,4046,49272,3869,5636,409,220,868,13437,90053,409,29449,10353,294,57286,799,13,19421,76776,41091,11,7930,39904,11083,503,3514,14014,11,6316,48901,409,11083,11148,1220,11,264,86595,978,951,951,10405,409,46939,5636,409,220,17,296,75104,409,1317,54401,409,46524,3625,908,729,513,34280,519,9465,3625,21120,11,3625,649,1147,934,85217,34280,64,1188,1880,3625,951,10405,13,362,5589,409,46524,39015,11,68225,5512,665,342,3326,5048,11,7930,308,6,546,29557,2221,409,20028,10390,655,1208,282,3023,265,6316,37291,2922,6496,8065,1765,1208,20605,24812,13,34447,11,5019,39929,326,6,4683,65679,2458,1604,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,3355,729,35597,9189,97448,653,46110,79071,14896,1744,503,49152,2852,824,1072,14240,519,33632,519,11,10071,1744,4864,9517,83,66867,2852,11,653,5457,409,42775,3869,1181,1195,13,24703,1744,4864,
