{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T19:42:54.865172142Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcription of the public given in TRANSCRIPT.\n\n**Question 8:** How do you rate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription? On a scale of 0 to 2, where:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe transcription contains some instances of the passive voice, which are mainly used to provide objectivity and clarity. For example, in the sentence \"Ce cancer de l'eau, si le va toucher principalement les adolescents, les jeunes adultes et les personnes âgées,\" the phrase \"le va toucher\" is in the passive voice.\n\nHowever, the use of the passive voice is not excessive, and it does not obscure the meaning of the text. The speaker uses the passive voice to provide factual information and to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner.\n\n**Option chosen:** 1\n\nThe use of the passive voice in this transcription is generally effective in providing clarity and objectivity, but it could be used more sparingly without affecting the overall coherence and meaning of the text.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,11,4864,36731,4571,3457,3675,1880,4864,42775,273,1765,326,57286,799,294,22827,9572,409,326,93847,13,1708,1105,11,9189,12584,89,757,7631,261,87320,41091,11,653,64441,66,3675,86100,48021,1647,4046,884,346,7010,3625,3611,17724,409,1208,32118,8332,483,13,19421,14707,11,272,17771,1120,1133,5019,1469,90332,6316,48659,3057,1557,1880,409,43453,91116,294,6,44803,325,13,19421,87320,1826,54312,1744,514,296,55624,978,22550,3869,653,9572,409,326,93847,11,326,93847,513,259,26248,8065,11347,30,4366,346,934,35329,78422,12339,409,326,93847,13,9589,54312,653,5634,28154,2933,1744,41091,665,37622,1744,64441,66,3675,11,4864,63762,11,1826,46481,1773,59858,13,1708,1105,11,3846,9572,409,326,93847,11,274,35329,11412,5916,261,7546,54960,3625,51516,11,3625,60120,88025,1880,3625,48577,29005,70,14014,13,62293,653,9637,2249,409,49972,13109,11,2536,326,42069,2298,220,1272,14697,1708,1105,11,4864,9189,436,395,554,1744,9964,1560,11,272,17771,6316,54613,1765,653,3610,13,80905,514,38900,1826,57375,934,35329,11412,43678,326,93847,1765,514,43014,3900,513,57128,665,6316,16948,4558,346,409,296,46651,7930,11412,23008,9211,665,348,1334,514,66167,3930,34922,13,356,17771,20662,296,46651,294,93847,1744,503,34155,4186,275,13,19421,8065,48226,6496,294,57286,664,1291,653,9572,9952,409,1208,64441,11,4864,91507,304,2017,5636,33670,665,92759,519,8065,21134,9880,409,82620,13,356,17771,79071,14896,7930,1826,25945,28800,14240,664,1291,1370,3625,76305,75460,1841,46152,841,15132,55744,81235,56316,85877,440,5512,3869,3846,357,1037,2922,6496,13,34447,1647,84440,7930,23008,331,306,3869,326,39982,1291,404,11,41091,4864,841,7591,95423,3869,326,39982,1291,404,13,14465,841,94297,6502,13,34447,3869,60946,265,4068,3900,513,57128,1880,513,52895,375,5019,71751,951,704,8839,5019,3009,716,4538,82620,13,1708,1105,5019,9189,71751,6316,7809,57288,11,326,93847,272,17771,653,46110,28800,22299,653,293,64272,3904,665,8246,13,7695,264,15907,6033,85,17740,71269,333,8467,11,7930,46932,306,951,6787,51625,285,9952,44093,3625,123299,9004,86374,4298,2249,11,44093,439,28111,14014,409,1208,27584,85722,13,24703,9572,409,326,93847,272,17771,653,951,12025,265,43563,11,272,17771,6033,63346,8065,934,2416,25253,13,1952,379,86807,6502,1765,1744,514,22021,308,17771,6502,24560,69241,582,978,1370,1208,13759,483,13,7695,513,17477,45575,409,3488,13,5034,55133,272,17771,934,80720,1826,514,5634,28154,2933,11,9604,265,3869,20028,3869,326,93847,6033,3869,409,1208,687,1116,1525,13,19421,1208,26633,90272,272,17771,934,80720,1826,1208,6070,11,58673,484,519,665,46932,519,409,87325,6787,6033,4684,4558,79507,8065,281,333,13,1708,1105,5019,514,5634,28154,2933,409,7643,296,46651,294,6,974,11,503,34155,52579,11083,4046,11943,484,2439,1880,503,6,4202,2852,20272,951,52314,409,16968,46110,9063,5019,4043,1155,409,7591,23827,261,1208,18528,13,19421,503,34155,100162,409,326,6,974,13,34447,3625,7930,1062,306,409,1208,60014,85,22626,1906,2922,6496,22021,13,27058,1208,6070,11,272,17771,5636,10878,13,356,17771,22299,951,19266,8839,409,38831,15170,3625,6787,409,8246,294,6,16348,4893,11,3869,51625,283,11,55455,42676,326,6,23604,519,13,1708,1105,294,31109,961,11,503,34155,5906,8065,1486,653,18629,409,19576,1765,294,6,10610,36306,11,7930,11412,23008,9211,3869,14843,556,1208,54743,409,3846,9572,1880,409,829,296,46651,294,6,974,11,55455,934,6,88423,951,83229,86709,294,6,300,28111,425,4382,13,19421,409,326,49455,265,11,503,34155,5906,8065,1486,951,38737,294,6,49921,73279,409,6070,11,1744,4864,91507,17537,72684,28463,14707,3869,11083,100246,409,19576,11,934,81991,11083,4046,11943,484,2439,13,12095,3625,26633,757,33537,306,514,27584,65285,266,11,78124,11,389,264,3625,1376,2482,1880,389,829,275,6033,4020,716,514,82620,13,34447,16968,39043,308,41901,1826,35597,16081,65385,13,19421,1647,42775,11,272,17771,409,52895,716,27750,38737,3869,16081,409,1296,294,6,49921,73279,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,5019,20028,4631,261,40126,11,
