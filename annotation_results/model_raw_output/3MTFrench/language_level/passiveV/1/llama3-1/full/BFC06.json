To do this, note the TRANSCRIPT according to the questions in the QUESTIONNAIRE. For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, and 2 with explanations on what these options represent under the \"OPTIONS\" section. You can only choose one option and provide your answer in the form: Option chosen: 0, 1 or 2; Respond to questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**Questionnaire:** Question 8. In your opinion, on a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcript? OPTIONS: where 0 = No passive voice. 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity. 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:** [You know certainly about sands ni mélorelliens and the first scene, that of Simba's birth with this energizing music cycle of life. Cut three seconds to call this scene, pêse the agmanifique, the sun rises, African savannah and all animals arrive from everywhere to welcome the new prince. Even the disappeared ancestors are there to be magnificent and come. Now I propose a second version. Imagine, these same animals from the savannah and no need for integration with Simba in the community with just Mufasa and his wife, Simba's parents. Then everything is fine? No, we agree. Perhaps this holy inauguration will play a role in my thesis subject, so I'll present it now. As seen in the birth scene of Simba, when parents and a baby are born, it is a community event. All members of the community are invited. The family, friends, but also neighbors. And we observe that from year to year that this event has become an individual event in our Western society, limited to the couple. Grandparents do not want to be grandparents. Sometimes they are geographically distant from their children. The reasons are multiple and sometimes can be that young parents find themselves alone to become parents and take care of their baby. Just like in a thesis, you cannot do everything, the objective of my thesis was to devalue the effects of family support on future motherhood. Specifically, what effects does it have on young mothers when they are not satisfied with the members of their family outside of their partner, when they become mothers. To achieve this, I focused on the evolution of their psychological step, that is, their level of depression and anxiety over time, as well as the evolution of the quality of relationships. Conjugate, parental, and familial. In this context, I visited 35 young parents at home, six weeks to ten or less after the birth of their baby. I conducted in-depth research interviews with questionnaires and realized small films of family interaction. I achieved a total of 250 home visits. To highlight the differences, I divided my sample of 35 young mothers into two groups: those who could benefit from family support and those who could not. The results of my thesis show that young mothers who could not benefit from family support are more likely to develop depressive symptoms and anxiety over time, as well as a decline in the quality of conjugate relationships, more pronounced and rapid, and less fluid interactions with family members. Thus, my thesis allowed me to confirm that the event of birth remains a community event and that it is essential for professionals to identify young parents who cannot benefit from family support as soon as possible to accompany them best in their new role.]\n\n**Analysis:** Based on the transcript, I would evaluate the use of passive voice in the discourse as follows:\n\nOption chosen: 1; A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n\nThe transcript contains a mix of active and passive voice constructions. While there are some instances of excessive passive voice that may make the text unclear (e.g., \"Les raisons sont multiples et partis si peuvent être...\"), I believe that the overall use of passive voice is reasonable and contributes to the objectivity and clarity of the
