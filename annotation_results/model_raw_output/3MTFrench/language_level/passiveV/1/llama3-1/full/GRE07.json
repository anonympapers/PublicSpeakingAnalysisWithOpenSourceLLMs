{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T19:15:29.026313201Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcription of the public data given in TRANSCRIPT.\n\n**Question 8:** On a scale of 0 to 2, how would you evaluate the use of passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive use of passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Analysis:** Upon reviewing the TRANSCRIPT, I notice that the author frequently uses passive constructions to present information in a neutral or objective manner. For example, \"Les bulles... sont prépondérés rentres\" (The bubbles are preponderated towards the surface) and \"Un modèle permettant de prédire l'entrainement d'air du gé, permettrait en un seul coup de répondre à ces trois enjeux\" (A model predicting air entrainment of the gas would allow a single response to these three issues).\n\nThese constructions do not necessarily obscure the meaning, but they do contribute to a somewhat formal and objective tone. I would rate the use of passive voice as 1: A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n\n**Option chosen:** 1\n\nPlease note that I will respond to questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,11876,7173,645,11,665,6409,67,1098,978,5192,285,13109,11,15132,66056,1744,514,35641,22157,1826,3869,1208,282,37093,13,4072,645,15132,27389,3595,5512,8175,417,13,2998,5542,308,17771,6502,10264,978,32592,1208,7479,409,326,93847,11,27549,25692,23761,5906,665,21455,11,7010,6316,76069,635,369,51084,13,445,6,3239,4765,11412,45575,513,9517,1072,556,11,513,9517,1072,556,11,70374,934,81991,7684,805,11,19968,12584,1969,11,70374,32592,1208,8877,47661,11,1880,35977,479,11,665,8137,11,1208,5780,13,34447,27549,264,68905,28463,6316,67239,978,51794,5019,2145,8977,1208,41380,8047,6316,10353,39723,514,74672,264,653,5536,4698,50848,11,3666,81235,11,3869,1208,1062,273,294,22827,6800,81690,13,4072,645,15132,28463,409,1376,31355,294,6,4893,13307,409,20429,15916,409,326,6,1334,11,7010,326,93847,13,4072,645,1022,8135,3869,1208,100014,1080,60768,978,11,1208,50843,3056,343,48099,23669,11,74450,68,409,51651,77323,13,1252,83597,29557,61512,409,550,15433,556,326,6,24677,467,1133,294,6,1334,3930,6892,978,11,29557,30532,665,653,74206,16081,409,75871,265,3869,27750,56321,665,3841,2249,13,328,1189,10333,294,93825,1765,47661,11,274,6,24677,8047,951,6033,19456,1154,17055,772,462,14295,1880,274,80720,7591,5481,66262,13,356,17771,51625,285,42625,326,6,67816,409,1647,42775,13,27058,46777,74672,11,4864,51441,23761,13171,409,81994,404,11,829,10484,13109,294,6,1334,83786,25108,52235,13,328,6,1617,52009,409,1048,645,15921,5512,11,1880,28130,9517,42098,665,34501,409,1208,2848,17675,324,13,328,98279,375,757,13510,89,9189,13,507,2005,11,10071,514,80259,1826,409,62827,11,1841,665,17055,47262,13109,11,326,31769,15769,25692,10390,655,294,31109,6520,40095,409,5636,409,220,966,14240,1154,11,9952,653,7591,4590,30139,3869,66090,3930,312,268,6033,3930,312,268,13,1252,83597,9517,47348,665,9511,67763,841,29557,6502,294,6,677,2002,404,951,100246,282,2205,13,356,17771,87320,3900,264,20272,25400,1744,4864,2322,668,8065,1486,1208,5636,25626,1367,14081,3904,367,665,38900,5019,46131,514,74672,11,829,95480,1880,4538,305,3159,409,1048,645,665,6316,86806,37291,13,27058,45602,11,4864,757,36731,3869,934,81991,3846,4545,11,5019,45602,11,4864,757,36731,6916,8047,409,6730,76743,3869,47838,1448,978,4474,13,622,34155,68866,978,653,89714,5213,29097,7930,757,29557,665,16968,1486,409,1208,95480,3930,74672,11,294,6,677,2002,404,4538,14240,266,11,829,348,87960,1880,15907,54409,12760,11,3846,1744,326,26248,3972,841,25692,6502,46131,13,27058,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,32592,1208,7479,409,326,93847,11,4864,757,36731,94616,8047,409,4538,11142,2428,11,10071,294,6,287,81,10610,481,11,7930,29557,409,757,1167,554,1880,326,31769,8248,11,409,3625,687,978,1880,294,6,677,2002,404,1208,28463,28130,348,87960,13,2895,66096,3869,27750,24654,11,4864,94297,64972,60946,265,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,934,35329,379,514,342,1339,3869,4538,10648,409,1048,645,13,19421,44351,11,1446,55506,514,6367,409,1208,4415,24918,951,1048,645,13,19421,46939,11,503,41901,16796,33614,409,40744,3460,288,11,87451,934,35329,10390,1395,16968,64079,11,87451,934,35329,30870,713,7010,26725,3625,6225,11,87451,934,85217,15132,4684,4558,79507,14218,14014,11,1880,46777,653,9465,9465,84568,409,326,6,1334,3869,274,58591,1543,404,13,1708,1105,11,272,17771,87320,11,5019,326,6,20243,38469,951,296,4618,15715,266,8467,1880,326,31769,21264,582,13109,4046,39624,99188,11,4864,36731,7245,38284,11,1880,4684,4558,79507,2995,351,978,3869,75249,272,17771,1208,7173,273,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,279,586,828,2728,304,41447,25823,382,9,9,14924,220,23,68063,1952,264,5569,315,220,15,311,220,17,11,1268,1053,499,15806,279,1005,315,28979,7899,304,279,41602,315,420,46940,1980,9,9,3883,68063,198,198,9,220,15,284,2360,28979,7899,13,198,9,220,16,284,362,2766,315,28979,7899,369,32373,60589,1968,13,198,9,220,17,284,1398,87728,1005,315,28979,7899,430,3727,279,1495,25420,382,9,9,27671,68063,30538,
