To do this analysis, note the TRANSCRIPT according to the questions in the QUESTIONNAIRE. For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, and 2 with explanations for what these options represent in the \"OPTIONS\" section. You should only choose one option and provide your response in the form of \"Option chosen: 0, 1 or 2; Answer the questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\"\n\n**QUESTIONNAIRE:** Question 8. In your opinion, on a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcription?\n\n**OPTIONS:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\n[...]\n\nTo answer this question, I will analyze the TRANSCRIPT and choose one of the options.\n\nOption chosen: 1; The speaker uses a little passive voice to convey objectivity and clarity. For example, in the sentence \"Comment puyre j'utiliser cette biomasse? Fait un combustible écologique.\" (How can I use this biomass? Make an ecological fuel.), the speaker mentions making a fuel without explicitly stating who is doing it, which creates a sense of objectivity. Additionally, some sentences are phrased in a way that focuses on the action rather than the doer, such as \"La pire au lis, c'est la dégradation thermique d'une matériau...\" (The pyrolysis is the thermal degradation of a material...). Overall, the use of passive voice is not excessive and serves to maintain clarity and objectivity in the speech.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,708,404,13,356,17771,4046,783,52985,1744,1208,628,455,472,951,48577,49733,5019,4538,8162,263,5019,13826,2084,3625,5954,2201,417,1880,409,841,513,15132,56316,6669,1572,294,49963,12329,3625,296,20243,2298,5019,20028,3625,44545,21041,409,326,49152,283,6400,13,46408,264,84850,4558,21152,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,423,49963,12329,6316,57709,13109,8162,263,5019,20028,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,13,13789,11,503,6,26577,648,1744,9189,9189,7631,10333,22299,39043,15572,68,11,934,17771,54312,1744,503,34155,20272,294,58591,337,370,354,13,7777,11,13085,89,1744,9189,274,6,4842,4558,44974,11,1880,9189,864,55506,653,9145,84,6672,11,16968,463,648,11,653,9145,84,6672,409,281,9011,2727,13,80905,463,648,11,4046,12821,309,978,466,7010,326,6,17060,292,2298,13,12095,9189,93569,89,1208,9145,84,6672,294,6,87290,451,10390,1395,11,27549,11412,23761,1437,30872,75,8047,11,1880,15265,31547,942,35737,84871,409,282,372,14014,13,423,6,31936,936,11,503,6,301,6,25632,6181,282,372,8047,294,58591,337,370,354,6033,294,6,33707,49090,483,13,622,34155,281,11399,68,1647,513,69,3972,11,503,34155,326,26248,1321,2439,1880,503,34155,15925,653,12046,579,44545,1260,13,1708,1105,11,308,26248,6033,3209,519,934,80720,1028,1370,273,13,622,49152,2852,6502,326,17771,54312,1744,1208,48687,665,9145,84,6672,13,622,34155,28463,12611,978,294,53149,9484,265,6316,47838,5634,28154,2933,5636,91329,1640,2428,13,39783,5634,28154,2933,7930,312,1911,519,3625,99309,348,1821,48577,409,326,31769,64374,665,6033,899,481,665,477,9769,13,356,17771,5634,28154,2933,274,53149,6853,1208,17536,8065,58617,13,5034,17536,8065,58617,11,272,17771,43905,5634,20712,2942,2428,294,6,4775,483,39892,1880,10065,7930,25692,23761,5276,8047,665,4046,64374,13,4366,51173,11,293,536,1557,11,1208,5945,375,409,326,6,351,2265,10745,1826,28463,514,66304,13,356,17771,1208,1744,272,17771,46680,265,1208,55133,3488,409,86374,13,12535,281,4168,265,503,49963,12329,20662,39538,13559,30,435,1339,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,13,13789,11,281,1791,6985,11,503,98146,26577,648,294,31109,13988,15433,978,7930,274,53149,6853,1208,281,556,8065,41380,13,5034,281,556,8065,41380,11,272,17771,1208,7591,49241,30945,2428,294,31109,5634,28154,2933,294,22827,14036,764,12339,274,5770,19472,11,5019,39929,470,782,8747,11,3930,95917,7970,11,7591,70,13559,2536,9955,729,481,11,10253,12303,6033,12046,579,6033,3900,44545,1260,13,11842,11,3900,10253,12303,6033,12046,579,13,12535,9964,439,33614,1208,17536,8065,58617,9952,409,8162,263,5019,20028,409,326,6,44545,1260,30,13789,11,3900,47090,47929,1744,7010,6316,57709,13109,409,8162,263,3900,379,264,951,26467,98151,442,3326,10515,8467,9465,665,3567,2303,425,13,19421,7930,11,665,11751,519,409,3729,9952,1208,17536,8065,58617,11,39043,20272,1744,514,60821,2428,56445,3869,30870,15610,13,13789,11,22299,272,17771,54008,266,11,1069,89,6502,30870,484,978,22299,23464,978,11,39043,5353,6316,39676,3869,326,55624,57663,409,1208,17536,8065,58617,13,1219,2727,40744,3625,9517,12821,4065,13,2206,11,272,17771,39676,8528,73267,11,3869,1208,5788,409,523,61047,11,1880,44351,1208,7591,49241,30945,2428,7930,2558,1082,514,44545,1260,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,21965,326,6,329,1104,13109,409,7643,1296,13,24971,1744,41091,11,3900,47090,1744,503,34155,100162,409,4647,625,978,11,5019,1097,73511,15171,1208,44225,11,1880,514,3729,951,102369,2439,98151,442,3326,10515,8467,11,5019,1097,73511,15171,3625,523,5763,1759,409,1208,17536,8065,58617,11,1880,44351,11,39043,7591,49241,11,3625,523,5763,1759,409,1208,17536,8065,58617,11,1880,44351,1208,5788,409,44545,1260,13,13789,11,3900,379,264,49733,4502,11,1744,294,6,14283,18111,324,11,7643,1296,11,9189,274,17771,7591,70,9011,2641,11,3869,20028,15265,83187,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,11,46206,9189,11,3869,2807,265,15265,1343,78,2427,20372,292,2298,11,25145,72,48488,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,586,8982,2728,304,41447,25
