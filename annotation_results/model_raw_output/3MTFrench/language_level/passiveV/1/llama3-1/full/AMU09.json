Unravelable things we have learned in France that you are to stay. Some glass bridges, certainly, but mostly. And yes, amorality. But I know there is a morality that you did not have the chance to learn. That of fabulizing that I will recount. The elevator of the sea is the pig. A beautiful master and the ocean funds, after months at sea, returned in terms, wearing a strange element. A gluttonous pig gorged itself. It stopped for reconciliation. Put out some fossilized shells, which have the strange uniform to explain why it is thus disguised. For gluttons, this object equipped with me allows a great hair-lift to meditate. According to these words, especially in this case, the threat looms over animal reign. The times are for studies and explanations, particularly our methods of nutrition. The barbeque can follow all my movements and then compare them mathematically to the forms of my dives and movements. It spoke of aspects of regions, behold the words of a curious religion. But it added that it had identified three large groups of diving behaviors. Exploration, I dive very deeply. Never deviate for exploring more distant fish, incredible distances intervening between me and the fish whose I am s'ifrient. Active, if there are many nearby references or if currents come to swirl, I change direction at descent, just like air, to offend and nourish it. Upon arrival, well-nourished, I let myself go. By constant currents, I allow myself to be pierced. I can then conserve energy, digest, and chase after the most useful thing. One day, only behavior said that our love is that of eating. Filling pause with delicate sense, with greater joy and total insouciance. Our sage and the ocean funds, his cord, a simple comment. The limits of your earth are limited. Your behavior, you must adapt it. This is the title you must adopt to avoid tainting your permanence. Ladies and gentlemen, you would have understood. I try to explain how the ocean funds were made, this name we are unable to do today. That is, adapted, that is behavior, to the sign of its environment. And the question arises as to whether our dear friend will adapt to the change we are imposing. Now, if you want your children to have the chance to learn and recite tales, allow me this simple question. Is it the ocean funds or a pig?]","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,50501,69,481,1744,17317,57038,15925,3869,917,9484,265,665,9822,1744,9189,14240,74466,409,2800,261,13,3489,301,14295,61365,409,2807,265,11,2847,288,11,10071,76776,13,19421,97507,11,326,58591,10020,13,34447,4864,63762,934,35329,29253,6316,63683,1744,9189,308,6,52659,6502,15925,1208,6140,294,53149,9484,265,13,356,6853,409,1208,9765,125067,5741,1744,4864,91507,9189,55056,261,13,445,31769,8532,409,4809,1826,514,80181,263,13,1252,72006,7643,66014,1880,3625,21901,82,409,4809,11,42138,951,46415,7010,326,6,511,978,276,11,43989,409,54606,665,4751,288,11,1080,3168,978,294,22827,4046,376,853,33013,42625,13,1252,10594,265,2249,80181,263,274,6,3342,333,14687,13,7695,274,6,1138,37093,6502,5019,274,59858,265,41546,716,13,6344,10367,951,26495,4918,294,31769,764,437,13109,288,11,7930,264,326,31769,376,853,14113,68,5019,75249,389,326,6,20243,541,1826,44351,7591,8890,69068,13,8242,342,414,1969,82,11,42067,31260,15890,4864,36731,94616,978,11,29557,653,6800,3091,588,2249,2922,332,409,36252,664,1291,13,423,6,60917,12416,27750,13510,11,665,42067,665,54008,1291,11,1208,81695,281,4558,325,1765,514,83229,68255,10065,1291,13,11876,27138,15132,10253,14240,29246,1880,1367,10939,11,81186,409,12155,75601,2601,294,83508,3904,367,13,2009,3703,65,361,25692,46932,265,26725,11083,7591,64635,1880,45575,93455,86374,8637,81235,3625,1376,288,409,11083,628,647,5512,409,11083,54409,12760,13,7695,296,26248,44314,978,294,6,58158,951,38682,919,11,4160,321,6496,3625,78199,294,31109,2917,648,817,409,13901,13,34447,3900,264,90096,978,3869,39929,3608,90859,56321,94527,1912,288,409,52962,3808,409,628,647,978,13,76022,11,4864,7591,1189,25945,2848,2159,42625,13,452,554,514,7591,85,7246,5019,45740,414,404,5636,3625,4046,49974,11,3625,3709,3433,64,484,4893,1612,1149,80463,958,981,1821,9465,41091,1880,3625,58883,38448,15890,4864,36731,274,6,333,13283,13,10106,11,4502,10484,13109,409,463,8696,2109,31539,6033,4502,3625,2126,1821,3355,89810,3869,7364,65,290,1215,11,4864,2349,294,83508,1439,3869,1208,38052,68,503,710,978,326,6,1334,5019,47753,1880,3869,28130,46798,38315,3846,7364,2192,13,423,6,1138,1553,11,12108,14707,46798,1018,11,4864,757,93569,48908,13,4366,3625,2126,1821,6926,11,4864,757,93569,824,3913,13,14465,94297,45575,757,82653,12329,11,4170,52424,1880,523,34858,1208,5636,6316,768,409,4186,13109,13,1252,294,39982,86581,479,11,514,74206,52962,1133,22011,1744,29449,99253,3913,1826,66090,294,6,316,4091,13,1611,4538,69241,404,1208,18579,9952,7591,416,978,6225,11,9952,281,556,10479,24918,1880,2458,1604,1672,788,1873,13,44564,39361,1880,3625,21901,82,409,4809,11,829,1867,451,11,653,4382,88089,13,11876,294,41901,81,14014,409,15265,88026,15132,4017,5512,13,650,52262,52962,1133,11,513,42182,23761,10737,978,13,29179,321,6496,1208,8305,1130,934,35329,9189,47090,11142,261,5019,841,6502,1218,11252,15265,64032,1466,77,13109,13,36684,67,986,11,9622,46138,11,9189,326,6,4202,1339,13550,285,13,622,6,434,61055,294,6,30992,72684,4068,3625,3625,21901,82,409,4809,2267,1220,11,3846,9859,17317,74533,58271,75804,88253,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,10737,978,11,272,17771,52962,1133,11,8065,1879,68,2933,409,4538,50026,40280,13,19421,1208,3488,513,17477,409,47929,4502,29449,23008,52827,11,35737,274,6,20311,8065,2609,1133,1744,17317,74533,665,5542,409,737,20672,13,43987,26178,11,4502,9189,77438,55745,1744,26317,60404,1826,3869,28130,7364,1208,6140,294,53149,9484,265,1880,409,9517,66,2058,951,282,391,645,11,29557,668,89,1474,6870,20662,4382,3488,13,9589,54312,934,54386,1826,3625,21901,82,409,4809,6033,653,80181,263,949,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,74407,325,4096,334,198,198,66913,25,510,2127,56956,279,586,46940,2728,304,41447,25823,13,2057,656,420,6492,11,5296,1523,279,41447,25823,4184,311,279,4860,315,279,91022,7476,7618,13,1789,1855,3488,11,499,617,2380,2671,25,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,449,41941,389,1148,1521,2671,4097,304,279,52380,3857,13,1472,2011,1193,5268,83
