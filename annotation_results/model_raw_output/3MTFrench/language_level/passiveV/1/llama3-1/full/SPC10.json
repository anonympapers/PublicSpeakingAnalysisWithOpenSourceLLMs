However, the use of the passive voice is not excessive and does not obscure the meaning of the text.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on a subjective evaluation and may vary depending on individual perspectives and linguistic backgrounds.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,6,2706,81356,14707,9189,20028,20028,951,82653,552,294,31769,64374,13,65381,46777,37291,1744,4864,1437,29097,1647,23665,11,3900,74817,68,13,356,17771,409,326,31769,64374,1744,4864,2343,68,11,10071,7930,308,6,1138,535,56316,3869,7643,8919,648,13,64105,64,296,31769,1215,588,13,24971,9189,949,27058,60946,265,3846,1343,98078,48099,951,74817,3808,11,13085,89,6316,57625,273,294,6,19010,79351,409,36413,556,11,3869,7930,389,62163,294,6,14283,7010,6316,5216,13,19421,3869,1208,2035,934,35329,2126,30532,83457,7010,26725,3625,6225,14707,97717,13,2009,2126,519,98151,34395,11,272,17771,1208,27584,14896,13,24703,15132,951,98151,26692,7930,513,7591,501,18680,7010,951,89672,36252,543,8467,13,1952,28130,62163,294,6,14283,409,1208,85424,13,33150,23665,11,10071,3869,1208,2035,11,3900,5590,11,3900,513,390,818,11,3900,274,31769,1215,588,1880,3900,274,31769,971,588,13,12095,389,17258,85,1339,13510,3869,26725,27750,98151,26692,11,409,513,7591,91312,31914,6480,7010,3625,89672,11,15878,20028,514,3122,569,11,10071,389,841,41518,14687,5636,294,31769,64374,304,332,458,479,13,1952,92215,9517,1072,556,514,13026,409,8792,98151,462,14295,13,1952,92215,5708,261,409,326,31769,64374,37527,258,42625,5636,55455,409,513,9517,716,1072,7010,3625,89672,1880,3625,27360,13,64105,64,87264,6316,9517,65272,13,34447,4068,3900,17782,89,949,27058,3625,33013,4558,2396,409,36413,556,11,272,17771,51794,13,1952,3625,2322,665,98054,26633,1370,26633,13,34447,389,5019,3625,98151,26692,11,272,17771,24068,321,13,12095,389,17782,3869,20028,665,80444,934,35329,513,7591,501,18680,26633,1370,26633,7010,3625,89672,11,3900,308,59858,264,5636,294,31769,6583,1386,1133,1880,5636,409,281,14140,294,31769,64374,13,1952,917,6853,39043,1208,2307,23184,1076,344,13109,13,8560,75876,43765,11,5019,379,2961,1553,11,3900,47090,55668,265,3869,25945,3122,325,2798,14081,1598,13,27058,3625,98151,26692,11,27584,220,15,409,911,5512,11,272,17771,6316,57109,4558,325,12266,409,326,31769,5531,4150,13,46706,1208,628,455,472,951,32118,2629,2249,11,3900,47090,55668,265,3869,40970,220,14374,409,911,5512,13,34447,41091,11,503,34155,9964,22011,951,32118,2629,2249,11,3900,8657,275,409,55668,265,3869,40970,220,6860,409,911,5512,13,13789,11,5509,11,272,17771,35597,282,1607,13,34447,11,272,3433,10333,1474,6870,11,272,17771,48488,5636,51794,3869,93381,71933,13,356,17771,36252,354,7930,3567,1188,409,2307,23184,1076,12844,3869,40970,220,6860,409,911,5512,60172,514,46110,9859,409,11957,652,69628,13,41621,9189,7631,10333,25692,85815,39723,389,25692,46524,27750,33651,2249,11957,652,9011,2392,13,65381,326,39982,9769,79,2223,11,1370,51173,11,7010,3625,97262,8839,11,3900,379,264,3900,379,264,31915,13,356,17771,77433,10253,21744,10515,5512,2307,23184,1076,25423,951,11957,652,9011,2392,1744,326,54386,25692,75831,79380,294,31769,64374,98151,34395,5019,78422,52424,951,71581,8622,10515,8467,528,4377,3920,1036,14014,514,34922,2854,467,13,34447,326,31769,11957,652,69628,11,389,841,829,275,6502,4068,39043,15572,68,13,1708,1105,11,5019,3625,60946,265,7010,1647,10278,78,11,4864,28068,2852,653,28800,8065,15765,484,519,409,1208,2126,409,9517,5192,978,13,46706,20662,2126,11,4864,6155,57332,16968,11,4864,6155,57332,11,829,62827,11,829,2798,14081,1598,11,514,13026,951,326,4558,2396,13,4366,86633,11,46152,15132,14707,1370,26633,11,10071,1370,86633,11,46152,28068,306,11,282,2182,11,1536,648,11,1880,3869,6636,6636,13,80905,11,272,17771,52962,1133,22498,951,98151,26692,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,11,389,7591,6414,6502,3284,7010,1647,503,71921,22299,514,35850,89657,6033,1208,308,17060,10515,292,13109,13,27058,22842,27750,52962,3808,11,503,34155,1206,1334,514,36252,278,9952,6316,41263,20712,21120,409,76651,67861,13,33150,3729,951,98151,26692,11,665,34501,409,43153,26633,1099,15433,351,31767,11,20662,76651,2349,1880,39904,10253,348,822,10145,409,5636,665,5636,19126,263,3913,11,42676,3625,98151,26692,15132,409,5636,665,5636
