The use of passive voice helps to present scientific data in a neutral manner, without attributing agency to specific individuals or entities. For example, phrases such as \"De l'eau ? Oui, mais pas que...\" and \"Les bact√©riques ont pris\" use the passive voice to describe events or actions without specifying who performed them.\n\nOverall, the use of passive voice in this transcription is judicious and serves to enhance the text's objectivity and clarity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,48109,74533,665,7364,261,409,8162,8629,1082,13,350,21198,11,9839,1037,89,45325,665,369,49530,1880,2961,37093,89,45325,77558,6316,1344,582,593,13,9605,23933,10333,45325,949,1611,326,93847,949,507,2005,11,10071,6502,1744,11,665,59157,13109,11,6316,1709,67100,8162,2445,454,2428,513,7591,583,273,11,32592,12155,20043,2249,15878,934,54386,44829,325,264,716,346,35573,13,38891,89,45325,1744,20662,1709,67100,274,6,582,396,651,268,404,220,17,87081,409,293,533,35285,13,423,22827,81337,11,3625,293,533,35285,4881,264,417,11,409,326,49455,265,11,3625,5534,2852,3930,955,409,293,533,35285,2249,13,65381,1913,409,59394,514,6155,57332,409,1208,1344,582,593,1880,409,28068,404,951,9257,65970,665,1344,9425,11,47053,2957,281,12583,978,11,95917,359,951,87081,11412,23008,9211,3869,4046,4763,10670,1765,1208,21797,325,556,13,5034,26725,513,1589,8047,951,293,533,28154,14295,1826,409,20662,18803,8047,10253,87892,11,6316,5089,978,14707,5636,45371,1744,951,293,533,28154,14295,11,7930,82133,68226,513,7591,91312,1880,296,4091,16968,1765,28130,21765,13,426,533,28154,14295,14848,52579,13,356,17771,42844,11,3900,841,274,6,57558,1339,6502,3869,3846,1744,3625,293,533,978,4298,2249,514,63762,472,1880,1421,81,29051,6316,84972,7591,69178,40321,8047,409,293,533,28154,14295,71269,333,8467,3869,28800,3625,342,290,36527,2922,53149,288,409,98178,321,1354,11,6033,5019,15858,3125,3625,342,290,36527,13,24703,15132,951,293,533,28154,14295,294,52152,376,582,19010,74775,7930,82133,513,1208,74333,41635,261,1370,3625,87892,11,10071,7930,82133,68226,31807,1601,3869,28130,72601,409,21552,13,4072,645,82133,44351,68226,75144,1208,296,26584,22299,653,100136,5019,513,1760,978,1414,11,10071,44767,5019,3846,31659,2167,1133,8065,19910,409,73103,63484,13,41621,326,6,4202,74466,13550,285,11,3625,293,533,28154,14295,15132,96308,8811,665,1486,11,1880,4864,94297,3625,60946,265,13,3341,665,59157,13109,11,3625,342,290,36527,15132,28463,653,80259,5019,17317,13,2998,67781,11,37953,447,6,37907,513,38831,283,688,7010,12155,9517,325,12249,294,93847,11,1880,82133,68226,513,31659,77433,3869,1208,30179,768,951,87892,13,19421,87158,326,54386,11412,33515,261,951,8162,70,412,409,326,26248,579,294,93847,35522,8047,1370,27750,293,533,28154,14295,11,1880,82133,68226,513,1515,261,7010,12155,17258,24483,11,31807,1601,3869,12155,2849,2482,4998,3928,17724,11,1880,44351,1744,27750,26633,62281,30020,409,5636,514,1647,12339,13,67440,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,3869,1208,12976,528,547,9465,3625,3625,342,290,36527,1880,4538,9859,409,4538,47838,50026,40280,278,1208,296,579,13,2998,757,42199,285,519,1765,3625,22337,20243,2482,2558,3695,1370,1208,296,579,13,5034,55133,14240,2070,409,1647,46494,264,24560,409,90194,951,22337,20243,2482,3869,14240,664,1291,13,27058,45602,11,503,34155,52579,951,87892,1744,503,34155,5906,665,3729,6033,2536,9952,951,73083,290,36527,13,622,34155,11741,1339,326,6,49575,951,22337,20243,2482,409,95917,2957,951,4787,1744,503,34155,22209,978,44829,7809,978,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,503,34155,7591,21200,978,409,274,6,329,3168,978,16271,665,73661,66262,3625,22337,20243,2482,30179,21938,7010,6316,3044,11,6033,3731,6960,11,6033,15890,1208,10484,13109,1826,1491,13215,8047,13,5034,26633,90272,14240,2070,409,1647,46494,264,24560,294,6,14283,14240,664,1291,1208,34501,409,27750,22337,20243,2482,7010,1208,4571,72,38469,409,1208,296,579,13,2998,5589,11,1208,8348,13532,25253,14240,2070,409,1647,46494,264,24560,409,77680,3125,1744,27750,22337,20243,2482,15132,14707,11866,5118,14014,37953,409,1208,12976,9952,3625,73083,290,36527,13,2100,275,665,4799,285,519,28130,47544,7010,3625,87892,11,45441,665,3625,8654,5615,1557,2249,13,41621,326,6,4202,74466,13550,285,13,3206,46494,409,270,4558,325,264,54206,294,49152,13603,6316,94721,13550,978,71,2711,409,1208,12976,9465,3625,73083,290,36527,1880,43153,11543,50026,40280,3916,11,3625,87892,15502,13,1611,5636,11,20662,94721,390
