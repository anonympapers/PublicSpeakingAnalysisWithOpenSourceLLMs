{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T17:26:56.613995297Z","response":"**Analysis of the transcript**\n\n**Question 8:** How would you rate the use of the passive voice in this transcription's discourse?\n\n**Option chosen:** 1\n\n**Reasoning:** The text contains some instances of passive voice, particularly when describing technical aspects or abstract concepts (e.g., \"Les objets que j'ai tu dit...\"). However, the author also uses active voice to express their personal opinions and emotions. Overall, the use of passive voice is not excessive, but it serves a purpose in conveying complex ideas in a clear and objective manner.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The text is written in an informal, conversational style, which may contribute to the moderate use of passive voice.\n* The author's focus on technical aspects and abstract concepts leads to some instances of passive voice, particularly when describing systems or processes.\n* The text also includes personal anecdotes and opinions, which are expressed in active voice.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,1826,54312,1744,9189,9189,3288,10333,665,77463,6033,99568,3675,6033,27584,75804,88253,7010,20662,71632,79380,1765,26317,523,4558,2396,949,2009,27065,409,77463,272,17771,3846,75802,3869,1208,293,7379,3930,10025,593,294,22827,8137,737,1083,519,13,4366,51173,11,4502,9189,1239,42441,89,6033,409,16578,4263,4558,2392,514,628,2642,263,11,47592,45325,15925,1069,324,934,35329,274,6,20243,583,273,1765,9189,41199,1744,9189,62299,69003,978,42138,12303,2530,1880,2536,1880,20662,2389,5397,11,27549,9189,86100,665,48901,409,326,6,1132,8525,68,1880,951,6033,85,17740,7930,14848,19477,3159,3846,293,64272,3904,13,13789,11,272,17771,83195,11,9189,841,841,3665,89,6502,934,85217,15132,10071,9189,3665,89,1744,3846,15132,951,47104,75332,812,1744,28130,42775,264,24560,6155,9769,69328,1880,1208,4160,321,6496,15265,40192,648,1744,514,12088,301,841,11412,6502,9189,10390,655,1765,1208,83067,13,62408,73876,9465,40192,648,1880,2389,5397,11,272,17771,514,272,89412,409,1647,42775,409,38317,13,11876,2909,1441,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,9189,665,47592,45889,8261,7010,15265,11347,11,48454,12704,361,11,100007,1880,25692,85815,27584,1206,978,409,81645,9952,6033,1653,5808,6138,13,350,788,27750,2909,1441,14951,29580,951,46681,6225,21041,16968,665,34561,5118,519,3869,6138,9952,294,81979,97262,8839,13,4418,66,42676,27750,17320,15132,29739,14014,6033,33032,13215,5512,11,272,17771,1208,60172,6033,65932,3869,1208,4156,409,9120,936,556,11,8065,4499,409,81645,11,3869,326,6,355,554,11939,294,6,1748,13109,665,5589,11,1208,30870,447,8047,48647,11,3846,75249,949,1708,1105,11,5509,11,3869,326,31769,5481,593,951,50455,2439,45640,1759,11,29739,14014,951,92096,11,39043,17258,85,1339,513,20028,9952,653,15952,1880,951,1344,4558,8696,11,10071,75804,88253,11,36346,14707,11,389,11412,13510,75804,88253,11,3846,308,17771,6502,48488,5636,77411,11,3625,46681,4319,29580,7010,326,6,1334,1370,951,389,5919,13,5034,60172,2442,6,2933,7930,25692,326,31769,11600,1430,9952,6316,4382,3276,26193,13,4418,66,1647,42775,11,272,17771,294,6,44803,805,1208,76407,15890,26317,2909,1441,1826,1081,9782,54401,409,71751,6316,40192,648,1744,27584,4502,653,55066,3625,16948,290,4978,11,46152,841,5019,969,6502,665,5066,556,951,46681,6225,21041,9189,4747,519,13,34447,389,264,653,46110,80259,13,14465,36731,272,729,978,85775,1435,40744,3625,95972,2439,15890,389,92215,513,7591,583,1565,6316,18874,9952,1208,88265,653,55066,34284,618,1339,13,19421,3613,81,4558,79507,11,39043,71925,6960,951,11990,409,4865,3869,85775,1435,1880,51794,479,43905,6316,17536,409,42775,33670,294,49152,13603,514,25646,13,33150,99568,3675,11,4864,42775,273,39587,76776,3869,52895,716,653,18629,7930,1826,2515,84,3846,17779,294,6,44803,325,3869,7643,2035,11,66021,1744,7970,11,53052,348,87960,11,4864,36731,42676,27584,78060,11,78060,2761,65220,3625,6141,3357,1759,13,34447,665,20272,11,27584,5019,84440,11,1208,259,9011,1557,1826,4502,46382,2428,1744,951,65838,409,5935,841,15132,1370,86633,6502,8657,285,15844,13,19421,272,17771,5019,39043,1744,326,6,28400,467,66167,8791,458,13,14465,52895,375,409,80080,12823,88817,11943,3625,3775,645,409,77463,5636,60538,336,479,1880,44351,48488,5636,100198,13,435,2259,1001,11,389,513,4684,66522,79380,14707,37953,294,52152,45109,89,1474,6870,1880,40126,11,17317,17258,85,2439,8678,805,11,1760,978,1414,951,42345,66474,5636,69125,7930,5019,9598,45575,23761,7591,2760,5512,7010,26317,17536,99568,26584,13,1708,1105,11,2515,91640,11,9189,5019,7379,89,39929,1069,324,409,26725,3625,1665,288,7930,9189,1218,283,8135,11,10071,1647,42775,1826,51625,285,42625,7591,85,13109,45602,54401,409,2840,74333,7010,15265,11347,8065,81337,409,15265,48454,12704,84,6033,409,26317,1206,5512,409,81645,653,28800,409,2389,5397,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,27671,315,279,36815,334,198,198,334,14924,220,23,68063,2650,1053,499,4478,279,1005,315,279,28979,7899,304,420,46940,596,41602,1980,9,9,5454,12146,68063,220,16,198,
