For example, when describing the process of training a computer to recognize handwriting styles, the author states \"Je lui montre plein d'exemples de textes écrits par la même personne pour qu'il [l'ordinateur] prenne donc en compte l'image.\" Here, the passive voice is used to emphasize the objectivity of the computer's learning process. Overall, while there are some instances of passive voice, they do not overwhelm the text or make it unclear.\n\nPlease note that this analysis should be done in the order of the QUESTIONNAIRE, and only one option can be chosen for each question.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,393,944,12339,479,11,503,34155,66283,978,653,52827,7930,42775,273,7010,514,2532,951,39104,409,1208,4379,13,14465,9189,1860,283,68,934,35329,308,26248,56316,3154,519,409,8631,7010,829,17536,13,4366,346,934,35329,308,6,1138,535,6502,1880,294,6,519,3125,3625,81098,1759,409,76076,9477,1880,34280,278,2908,13,14465,25400,834,1744,4864,94297,259,26248,1814,13,19421,42676,4864,36731,8414,6960,665,51307,2428,11,4864,9517,978,1072,273,25400,51625,12329,1744,272,17771,77433,3869,1647,46110,6141,3357,324,1880,2536,1370,9952,11083,20043,2249,1744,503,65948,2852,326,26248,1814,13,4366,346,1744,272,17771,1120,1133,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,409,23008,9211,1880,294,6,519,3125,6316,54613,294,6,60917,12416,4538,89532,554,13,64105,64,9189,3429,77422,24614,1557,13,27058,62998,20028,949,4366,51173,11,4864,94297,91878,1208,4379,3869,13110,326,26248,40095,294,31109,4824,23775,409,97139,519,11,3625,1095,45632,409,81695,11,3625,1095,45632,409,6816,799,11,8065,14707,409,77680,3125,28130,259,8322,13109,3930,12223,13,445,27688,8047,1744,503,34155,4046,10036,75144,1208,33651,817,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,5019,8678,805,11,16456,3458,66014,514,1742,294,6,20243,1018,554,409,26077,447,22827,11,1744,3846,45441,89532,665,55467,11,665,76185,11,8065,89429,355,409,326,54386,13,7505,97507,11,42676,9189,3665,89,11,95917,359,89532,44178,1864,479,11,6316,27584,54613,308,6,20243,1018,56316,409,3585,3869,653,3937,409,1208,27584,76407,13,1708,1105,11,4068,20028,949,12535,20028,5019,98054,326,6,8904,324,25530,1880,13171,409,16456,3458,66014,326,6,20243,1018,554,949,356,17771,39015,1744,4864,52571,3869,737,2058,514,34501,40280,79402,3930,272,5976,2933,2854,467,7010,11083,38737,51307,8467,13,19421,272,17771,77433,3869,653,98947,409,21850,3233,1989,1104,13327,645,934,54386,1153,1339,409,2606,4918,1880,409,2606,4918,409,5440,17724,5935,82,1744,503,34155,18757,52895,716,653,21134,272,5976,2933,1661,78129,13171,294,53149,8135,1056,425,13,356,17771,294,6,42273,1744,16968,71357,11,503,6,306,969,25108,76,1647,6141,3357,324,3869,16456,3458,66014,294,6,370,541,3625,57705,31539,11,389,7937,951,78199,11,44829,3625,32847,1765,951,5448,294,6,20243,1018,554,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4864,25400,1280,2428,326,6,6581,371,1880,3625,3585,57705,4558,66,8467,7930,42182,59394,39587,665,8924,326,78337,13,19421,76826,11,4864,25400,20605,265,84871,294,58736,3342,645,409,1495,288,89532,82,1370,1208,27584,54613,5019,934,35329,264,550,49530,3869,1208,27389,3826,1880,3869,13110,4538,89532,554,13,19421,3869,1208,52087,8047,409,73103,294,49455,265,36963,13,4418,66,11,5636,4864,25400,20605,265,294,6,3726,11,5636,409,17536,1880,31914,580,13,19421,44351,409,16578,13,64105,64,11,272,17771,6316,15105,934,54386,917,6853,1208,10484,1056,425,61852,2428,2848,2159,11,3846,934,54386,917,6853,7010,514,96839,11,514,17347,9769,818,13,4366,51173,11,87158,9189,69152,89,514,5636,4635,84,5195,15415,2538,11,3900,69152,514,27584,17779,409,15105,5019,4790,52750,951,21633,477,3916,14848,519,9517,616,14014,13,445,6496,11,1208,1206,978,409,3846,72601,1826,514,6800,13026,409,21633,70720,7010,1208,2385,13,393,9425,593,272,17771,44093,1208,33537,978,7930,17317,9517,112916,1208,2385,13,2895,66096,3869,1647,272,5976,2933,1661,78129,11,1647,52827,951,3600,951,39104,264,18757,16456,3458,66014,100198,3625,81098,1759,11,951,19266,1072,447,3808,11,665,653,74206,81479,11,76608,1880,31528,13,12623,62197,11,3900,296,26248,7631,978,4502,389,25692,48908,5636,78060,5019,47929,4502,653,69067,264,24560,89532,1370,6316,18694,8065,4366,60010,13,14465,514,1765,59976,82,11,4864,25400,834,11,272,17771,4839,1133,4647,11943,9465,653,7591,68019,13,5034,76680,8637,2428,409,1647,463,8995,4652,7330,52760,11,3900,47090,6502,514,13510,409,1647,52827,11,3937,9334,1880,293,3102,288,27812,72,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,3984,304,41447,25823,3196,389,279,4860,315,2
