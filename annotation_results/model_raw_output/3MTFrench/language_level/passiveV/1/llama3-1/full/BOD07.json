There are some instances where the speaker uses passive voice, such as \"On trainait faire une crise\" (They were getting ready to have a crisis) or \"Ce qui m'int√©resse, c'est justement le bruit de moteur\" (What interests me is just the sound of the engine). However, these instances are not excessive and do not obscure the meaning of the text. Overall, the use of passive voice is moderate and serves to provide clarity and objectivity in some cases.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,816,26248,653,40351,11,409,2197,12267,11,934,54386,15119,1557,13,11842,11,4864,36731,6502,6316,10896,5048,11,389,5542,1339,20028,6316,1589,1082,11,4864,9189,36015,13,14465,3355,729,409,19126,263,3913,220,19,78199,11,39587,220,19,8859,1157,25945,96642,13,34447,11,272,17771,220,19,78199,11,389,79071,14896,951,25945,1179,1821,665,34561,13,19421,41091,11,389,259,41901,593,326,6,287,361,817,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,13,34447,9189,12584,89,757,7631,261,11,36346,1208,326,6,287,361,817,11,22011,5392,788,11,1744,9189,76605,13510,27750,220,19,78199,3869,326,6,75876,13,19421,4864,91507,9189,13510,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,6316,39603,17194,4725,13,2998,5589,11,4864,841,36731,6502,71269,689,1001,33288,2536,5636,13,34447,41091,11,4864,308,34155,9964,22011,6502,3625,26419,951,78199,11,503,34155,9964,22011,3625,26419,951,8859,1157,13,34447,11,272,17771,75249,653,39603,17194,30,80905,294,6,370,541,11,653,39603,17194,308,17771,6502,6502,52842,42625,51854,8859,1157,13,1952,308,17771,6502,46680,665,1099,13400,556,11,38605,27476,2784,3257,11,653,39603,17194,1880,26077,447,22827,7930,61735,19227,1001,11083,8859,1157,11,7930,348,11206,1339,59148,716,665,11990,409,308,6,768,12249,1880,4043,1155,409,3625,51010,36501,5019,46131,4068,6853,34501,818,13,1952,1826,653,28800,22299,3625,32118,4919,3457,729,13,1952,61735,13836,424,514,2107,354,5019,20028,57625,15610,7010,3625,88486,1759,951,8859,1157,13,9589,54312,7930,27584,5636,78422,532,1880,1744,46777,96282,1826,22299,6316,81645,51199,68,30,2009,55467,11,22299,503,6,351,299,404,9952,3846,88486,324,7930,5790,2298,818,11,1826,1317,75,8047,7930,1826,653,28800,22299,514,4483,29008,11,934,54386,4160,275,961,412,1880,7930,20272,71151,951,1437,344,285,2402,13,426,1116,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,272,17771,1120,1133,514,1437,3159,409,88486,324,13,4366,346,1744,39043,17317,665,22011,48488,11,39043,56445,34501,951,88486,1759,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,19421,39587,11,1647,96839,11,1208,51923,38469,11,389,1239,42441,32592,12155,2047,417,2107,2469,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,514,272,5976,2933,13,1952,42775,273,9952,4538,76190,951,1558,316,466,417,13,356,17771,22299,951,5708,1154,409,4538,3062,7010,46777,96282,1744,9189,47592,4685,978,7010,514,272,5976,2933,13,34447,27750,5708,1154,2609,306,9952,46777,96282,1744,9189,1370,41881,13,4366,51173,11,7010,7643,96282,308,460,273,11,3846,7930,326,6,124524,2852,11,389,308,26248,6502,514,4538,384,11,22299,56949,11,389,264,1744,514,4538,384,6033,11,22299,56949,11,1880,3930,16081,11,3625,60259,4949,14848,3930,8811,9465,27750,26633,26419,6033,1131,34447,11,46152,834,306,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,3062,11,389,11412,951,84939,2852,11,272,17771,15878,513,594,28111,8047,19227,1001,13,1952,841,60946,42676,389,1370,273,1913,11,272,17771,653,7930,264,2442,57375,30,34447,11,272,17771,42676,27584,1208,44178,16271,9465,48488,1880,48488,13,1708,1105,11,14707,1370,3625,8859,1157,11,308,6,277,462,729,3869,46131,9952,653,7970,30200,11,22299,389,9189,917,9484,3869,326,31769,56745,13,356,17771,76776,934,54386,1826,1880,7591,22188,5979,978,9465,3625,26419,1179,1821,7010,3625,5708,1154,3930,96282,3869,326,49455,265,13,1708,1105,11,19443,2439,27750,99309,78199,951,7591,65,6256,13,3489,17771,54312,934,85217,14848,665,34561,949,2998,20272,11,46152,687,72,89810,45889,12,8699,951,1615,729,4978,1880,5636,9024,3930,38900,13,1219,2727,11,272,17771,6033,75249,949,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,11,389,38831,83384,25945,28800,409,81645,39723,514,88486,324,20272,653,951,27750,99309,4160,3742,2922,6496,13,19421,41091,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,6,434,61055,294,6,30992,72684,87320,3738,288,8859,1157,687,72,89810,27750,1615,625,17724,11,10071,6502,294,49455,265,13,4366,346,1744,11,1880,3900,379,264,653,55520,3062,9465,3625,26419,409,12155,8859,1157,11,1880,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,12155,272,5976,12249,11,1880,1208,57625,273,841,1515,2
