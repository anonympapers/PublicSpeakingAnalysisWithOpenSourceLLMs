To do this analysis, note the TRANSCRIPT according to the questions of the QUESTIONNAIRE. For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, 2 with explanations on what these options represent in the subsection OPTIONS. You must only choose one of these options and give your answer in the form: Option chosen: 0, 1 or 2; Answer to the questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\nQUESTIONNAIRE: [Question 8. In your opinion, on a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?]\n\nOPTIONS: where 0 = No passive voice. 1 = A little bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity. 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.]\n\nTRANSCRIPT: [...]\n\nAnalysis description:\n\nOption chosen: 1; The speaker uses a moderate amount of passive voice to provide objectivity and clarity in their discourse. They use phrases such as \"Les tronouis se sont ces gigantesques étoiles mortes\" (The tronous are these giant dead stars) and \"Les onde gravitationnelle voyages à grande vitesse\" (Gravitational waves travel at high speed), which help to convey complex scientific information in a neutral tone. However, the speaker also uses active voice when describing their own experiences and thoughts, such as \"Je peux alors les analyser pour en apprendre plus sur les tronouards qui sont à l'origine\" (I can then analyze them to learn more about the origins of the tronous). Overall, the use of passive voice in this transcription is moderate and serves to maintain a neutral tone while conveying complex scientific information.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,74282,1056,1339,45325,3625,5041,729,3869,13697,949,65381,1208,80091,951,99253,11,3625,8811,11943,288,7010,326,77025,5481,404,6367,409,513,9517,1072,556,1208,463,331,8511,13088,373,5041,268,13,34447,3846,841,15132,6502,3625,513,14630,13,64105,64,348,10126,1744,39015,2902,2784,11,3625,490,263,49090,28463,523,5048,37953,447,85217,15132,1097,80284,2249,13,11876,490,263,49090,513,15132,27750,23401,15844,14295,4046,998,3742,10237,288,11,54008,67882,2624,81,4558,2392,13,34447,37953,447,85217,259,3514,306,90053,294,22827,83491,263,11,46152,513,7591,68654,1437,4168,64656,28130,74599,2727,13,11876,4571,3457,729,2109,31539,15907,21961,409,490,263,49090,665,4046,6232,519,27750,88587,294,58591,414,11,1744,326,54386,917,6853,50103,29059,7709,64829,13,1219,2727,1208,41263,20712,11,3625,50103,29059,7709,64829,23933,1154,3869,25626,348,87960,11,220,3101,220,931,13437,1370,2132,288,13,34447,4502,653,4382,8309,8657,275,3869,513,1028,64032,1565,1208,41263,20712,11,55455,308,6,1138,37093,12155,50103,29059,7709,64829,1765,28130,63128,295,5553,1208,88026,13,42759,17317,11,272,17771,653,2307,91116,5019,16948,290,1215,3625,490,263,283,17260,3869,25626,6138,13,34447,13085,89,96308,11,79071,961,39015,2902,2784,11,653,5743,409,490,263,283,17260,4046,76,4558,2392,951,389,5919,29059,7709,8301,645,13,36684,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,27750,389,5919,29059,7709,8301,645,11,4864,42463,3625,85877,440,261,2536,6502,9952,220,16,11,220,17,11,10071,14707,220,18,47710,13,9605,1208,6140,513,39904,379,3869,326,6,64469,11,27389,3415,275,294,6,3239,42219,7010,326,77025,1330,13,27058,64972,60946,265,11,1880,5019,4046,70,12329,15265,917,10515,275,33670,326,6,283,65930,3930,61886,11,4864,9189,30714,409,93455,326,22827,1986,3869,653,757,5589,11,5019,261,9952,56321,64032,79,3695,409,72476,266,13,41621,326,41901,884,1762,89,3625,64032,79,3695,513,15132,9622,266,19010,3695,13,921,20234,6316,294,6,40997,84568,665,88135,653,20272,1765,1208,1167,12267,10253,26633,46106,13,5034,6138,9465,3625,64032,79,3695,11,272,17771,220,17,220,931,13437,11,1880,39587,514,27138,409,63128,295,409,1208,41263,20712,1208,1167,12267,1826,50026,220,23,342,13,12095,74699,11,46152,308,6,546,6316,29059,7709,64829,39904,9465,11083,64032,79,3695,11,514,757,5589,6316,305,1553,64592,69,273,73083,12339,479,22299,7010,653,3116,13,19421,3625,64032,79,3695,11,272,17771,514,832,3625,6316,951,46106,13,2009,27138,409,63128,295,1826,294,31109,64032,6100,3869,326,49455,265,11,1880,2609,978,11,27549,1879,1604,1208,1167,12267,308,6,1138,535,6502,3869,28130,27389,46790,13,1708,1105,9189,12584,89,757,13510,11,272,17771,14707,22176,64,11,8941,490,1791,11,10071,41091,11,4864,100164,84871,409,6503,2439,7930,5019,969,3327,72684,514,77072,3930,1208,1167,12267,13,5250,332,85815,1744,514,8450,308,17771,6502,79988,45575,11,6033,14707,25692,85815,1744,326,6,269,385,713,841,21559,6502,514,4839,11,1120,1133,1647,42775,11,272,17771,409,19266,62219,8065,64972,514,77072,3930,10253,389,36490,7709,8301,11,7930,77072,306,3930,10253,46106,47371,2784,82,13,20263,12,30690,7011,511,7930,50590,934,22827,6141,3357,324,11,4864,1675,1130,1647,757,5589,8065,64032,6100,13,622,98279,2852,26725,3625,81336,15433,4167,63846,17724,13,507,983,361,29059,7709,64829,11,66517,779,21120,11,10071,76776,653,39143,42045,13,7011,336,754,2303,978,10415,261,87158,503,34155,917,6091,3869,13399,261,3625,389,36490,7709,36527,13,14465,94297,45575,3625,8678,805,5019,665,917,9484,265,5636,1765,3625,490,263,283,2402,7930,15132,3869,326,6,4775,483,13,65381,26077,6138,409,1208,88026,513,2503,361,2442,57375,11,934,6,37907,15132,28130,58617,11,3698,3675,3900,379,665,264,2442,57375,11,4068,264,59062,978,326,39982,1553,934,17771,54312,1744,514,2466,26518,11,665,5589,11,4864,296,41901,9839,2192,653,28800,653,17154,13,1952,514,829,275,75804,88253,11,326,22827,1986,16968,16006,1291,11,274,6,8629,1082,665,23401,15844,593,10361,951,311,3742,934,54386,91
