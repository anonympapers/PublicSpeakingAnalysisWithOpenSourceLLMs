Overall, the passive voice is used judiciously to convey technical information in a clear and concise manner.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,9424,55506,45325,665,1913,3625,86696,281,64272,978,3869,1208,86451,13,61651,14707,41091,503,41901,16796,20272,1647,42775,11,4864,39904,1208,4647,12583,978,409,11083,503,3514,14014,11,3625,69236,7010,1208,30870,273,3869,20028,951,86696,281,64272,978,1880,4864,3625,757,817,3930,383,324,9952,51625,1854,13,34447,58673,2249,409,38317,6824,68,3869,57705,258,12329,653,13399,5048,30945,2428,887,63497,5019,514,293,64272,3904,11,3900,42182,23761,514,5636,91329,1640,2428,1880,514,5636,2804,519,3284,13,1952,25692,514,9765,462,16339,1685,593,961,412,1765,10335,265,9952,71686,56321,81336,15433,4167,1744,326,54386,46524,64,44093,326,6,17270,1001,13,7695,841,54206,85624,7591,40213,11,3900,5708,48488,409,1841,20337,1880,665,5636,389,25692,514,1421,10993,3869,326,52152,5589,72,13,356,17771,3709,3433,481,5019,47929,3846,1744,272,17771,13,14465,9189,665,3488,5019,653,296,1525,13,7777,11,55133,3869,14707,13,7054,11,26077,5634,28154,2933,409,8246,78771,57485,3869,1208,37291,7010,1208,296,554,1880,409,523,483,1880,7010,514,523,69628,2933,409,26317,342,14081,1900,1826,917,6091,8065,4382,13,34447,25945,6485,68,11,1841,25945,3977,13,507,2005,11,1208,88026,1589,1130,13,46706,11083,58673,2249,11,4864,326,57286,664,648,3869,85114,4046,331,37907,5019,665,7591,23827,261,27750,40321,1821,13,2876,64656,11,3625,1417,3742,1376,307,4893,390,818,14818,3916,13,7777,11,26633,90272,40574,978,668,324,13,7054,11,26077,628,5048,30,4418,66,3625,16178,417,14848,55505,1208,59251,951,23125,1154,951,5636,94527,293,349,12249,13,1252,36271,7930,513,282,3972,11,3900,1826,44767,13,507,2005,11,514,87938,13,65381,326,55624,57663,409,1208,259,7404,11,389,71451,409,98385,54008,417,8065,80664,519,8065,66304,25945,73083,12339,1841,7245,483,409,8882,13109,13,356,17771,12,6853,7930,1469,403,2473,514,68226,13399,519,30,2009,490,1791,11,272,17771,934,35329,379,264,8065,40970,3154,519,409,87938,1744,409,87938,13,1708,1105,5019,3625,44178,63934,1291,11,503,34155,14240,21178,978,13,5034,259,7404,951,54008,4918,1880,28130,23878,13109,35406,8047,409,326,93847,13,34447,326,6,526,978,264,17317,409,220,18,25253,25795,11,326,93847,11,17317,64290,2439,3846,934,54386,917,6853,6316,76680,9011,46140,74672,8047,13,43987,26178,11,4068,14240,664,1291,3625,24601,409,20662,76680,46140,74672,8047,11,15878,20028,951,2606,81560,409,32118,5317,288,11,10071,665,864,52985,11,389,42463,20662,9765,1130,817,21797,13109,13,19421,14707,41091,7930,86807,100196,11,503,34155,20272,653,12366,13,622,34155,52579,11083,11176,288,13,19421,7643,281,6853,1826,1043,35213,3869,30517,43905,1208,72777,24812,1880,1208,20935,438,648,13,11842,6502,5019,3625,9517,41546,321,1291,11,10071,5019,91329,2743,220,966,2024,417,1744,503,34155,7591,566,95710,8065,2092,13,2009,9859,665,1760,511,1286,51625,285,5019,665,7591,23827,261,28130,52962,1133,665,34501,409,28130,26305,665,17317,13,14465,757,38831,83384,35597,9952,951,86696,3352,5512,13,34447,1208,44178,16271,9952,41091,11,16968,46110,11,272,17771,1744,503,34155,20272,951,4043,2852,665,9511,67763,5019,15522,3212,4839,1133,87320,1647,46110,3352,978,9165,729,6033,6502,13,41757,2743,11,8065,71751,951,2027,38647,409,87938,11,503,34155,45575,26633,1080,285,90194,653,7591,466,265,1880,951,87938,11,8065,52962,1133,25945,85114,13,19421,39015,11,95917,2320,354,11,4864,757,38831,83384,9952,272,6009,2024,417,11,69241,1056,1413,409,26725,781,285,11,1880,56321,87938,11,69241,1056,1413,409,43905,1208,9822,13,62293,11083,2024,417,11,1880,11083,87938,73661,552,11,503,34155,86595,978,951,32118,5317,288,11,44829,503,34155,14240,21178,28130,5178,13,39783,8941,3972,4046,4919,2428,89646,11,653,68226,13399,519,11,8065,1948,1880,6316,23878,13109,3869,342,52424,326,6,12828,2088,1880,16968,20622,13,27058,36015,89,3625,29005,4282,409,32118,376,28316,11,1647,46494,274,17771,2515,96559,7010,514,60697,409,38317,6502,409,993,9187,13,7695,18916,332,81186,951,100130,13,1708,1105,5019,1913,404,1
