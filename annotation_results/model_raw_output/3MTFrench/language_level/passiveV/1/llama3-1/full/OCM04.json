{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T18:19:08.58113745Z","response":"**Task: Analyze the transcript using the questionnaire**\n\n**Question 8:** How do you evaluate the use of passive voice in this transcription's discourse? (Scale: 0-2)\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice\n* 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear\n\nAfter analyzing the transcript, I would choose:\n\nOption chosen: 1; (A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity)\n\nReasoning: The transcript uses some instances of passive voice to convey complex ideas and maintain objectivity. For example, \"Le cancer, c'est un peu pareil\" (Cancer is a bit like this) or \"Les médecins disposent de thérapie très efficace contre les celles canceruses du colon\" (Doctors have very effective therapies against colon cancer cells). The use of passive voice helps to present information in a neutral and objective manner, making the text more accessible and easier to understand. However, I do not think that the use of passive voice is excessive, as it is mainly used to convey complex ideas and maintain objectivity rather than creating confusion.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,296,6,40541,817,11,4864,91507,628,316,1195,653,28800,326,6,3042,5397,13,14465,42775,273,1765,514,9572,79887,95081,1880,1765,1208,14091,318,2617,15756,10020,13,34447,649,44618,3869,326,6,4775,483,409,1208,18488,409,36252,561,521,7930,66167,409,1208,5353,3682,409,35881,12416,1370,9572,13,34447,514,9572,11,272,17771,75249,949,77533,10670,6316,47276,9859,76,8047,15235,7010,653,41376,1291,9859,102843,34922,13,1252,16081,409,20897,285,35881,579,409,274,6,64316,1826,25945,83457,11,272,17771,1208,15117,351,11872,978,13,46408,1913,1339,46110,3869,3846,3937,3327,2428,1880,513,282,66373,409,961,412,13,2009,9572,11,272,17771,653,28800,24068,321,13,7695,8657,275,294,31109,8431,9572,817,5019,20028,84871,409,98385,19637,645,9572,4881,13,15663,1771,82133,31632,11,1370,2145,2058,514,41376,1291,1880,274,6,64316,3869,326,6,75876,7010,514,34922,13,1952,665,38831,83384,665,67781,46206,514,8893,7010,514,17258,77282,11,7643,22419,97507,11,27549,893,593,6502,294,6,1334,13,34447,5636,71151,7010,514,22419,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,3625,32118,8332,1354,54240,306,409,76680,4714,648,25945,31914,580,45973,3625,19637,645,9572,4881,3930,15235,11,1841,389,3625,74282,77422,14707,13,2998,5891,29097,11,87451,37953,934,6,37907,14848,14091,978,1083,978,11,514,89714,1826,28800,31914,580,1841,3625,2849,2482,15132,28800,4635,355,1880,15878,294,2182,25945,96642,13,27058,3625,14240,21178,5512,11,503,34155,9765,462,64591,6316,20897,285,85059,13,350,5612,3625,2849,2482,409,1208,20897,285,15132,85059,11,13259,324,1056,5048,13,16233,1739,3625,2849,2482,3930,15235,7930,15132,5309,11,13259,324,1056,5048,13,1252,274,1260,665,3846,1744,6316,2854,12844,513,57128,1765,514,15235,11,27549,1826,409,61596,5309,12556,24012,13,14465,73953,89,281,17194,1880,272,17771,326,6,17156,458,1841,27549,1826,4538,9621,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,16968,294,6,370,541,6316,55133,2869,38469,7930,27753,17634,68,18300,68,7643,20897,285,13,1708,1105,11,4864,326,6,3064,2070,6502,1370,1208,7325,11,4864,841,326,6,9157,6502,79380,9622,46138,11,4864,326,6,3064,2070,13080,7010,25400,11,13080,7010,326,93847,13,14465,326,6,77196,647,68,7010,653,1794,4150,4046,4253,301,11,44829,77433,3869,653,7970,46415,942,11,4864,326,6,1138,853,18300,68,13,12623,47053,2957,281,81235,367,11,71686,1208,97332,951,2849,2482,13,362,32384,11,77433,3869,653,8162,1355,2474,11,4864,94297,77680,3125,4502,22299,7010,514,8893,11,503,41901,38831,83384,7010,514,17258,1677,11,514,12018,648,11,10071,87320,6502,379,26248,554,13,19421,665,67781,11,4864,841,9466,2852,7010,1208,11494,668,7930,1167,76457,13,5034,11494,668,87264,22299,6316,71632,294,6,1617,6960,33670,409,48041,71933,3625,2942,288,47371,2381,535,22299,514,17258,1677,1880,514,12018,648,13,1708,1105,74699,11,4864,63762,39723,46152,15132,11,272,17771,14707,72006,11,10071,4864,63762,66021,934,85217,14848,7010,514,10594,265,5019,757,326,6339,45973,13,14465,79196,12339,3625,2942,288,11,4864,550,19010,79351,27750,2942,288,11,4864,63762,6502,11,3625,2849,2482,11,3625,6316,951,46106,11,1880,4864,326,34155,20272,45347,7010,653,11,4502,259,6,4512,10367,665,31405,13,62408,5780,11,25689,261,3625,2849,2482,1880,3625,20272,45347,3625,6316,42138,3625,46106,77558,1208,1167,12267,13,356,8458,1167,404,1880,757,29557,73468,409,79196,52424,71686,3625,2849,2482,67861,5019,3625,29060,13,62463,29060,15132,13458,3916,11,1841,46152,82133,29557,10367,409,74282,66014,3625,2849,2482,1880,96637,6316,48454,3608,13109,13,62463,41376,4918,14848,24560,82133,29557,10367,409,90194,8065,64972,3625,9781,1224,812,11,1841,4864,100164,76190,11,653,89714,24560,59728,13559,11,4502,1880,71686,4502,11,3900,1826,2665,13532,665,34501,951,2849,2482,9572,4881,13,1708,1105,4864,296,6,20243,817,25692,85815,294,49152,13603,5019,11083,95673,11,10071,296,26248,1814,653,9622,84,11,4864,16948,12339,1744,3846,45441,11,4864,9189,16796,2579,263,1215,653,28800,294,77025,40807,13,2331,128009,1280
