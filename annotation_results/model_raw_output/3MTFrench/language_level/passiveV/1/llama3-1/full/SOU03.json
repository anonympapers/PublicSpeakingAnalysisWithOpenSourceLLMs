I will only select one option and respond accordingly.\n\n**Question 8:** On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\n**OPTIONS:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\nBased on my analysis of the TRANSCRIPT, I choose:\n\n**Option chosen:** 1\n\nThe transcription uses some instances of passive voice to convey objective information and provide clarity. For example, in the sentence \"Les mainsclés, le pouce,\" the subject is not specified, and the focus is on the action rather than the doer. Similarly, when discussing the deformation of the hand due to résartrose, the use of passive voice (\"elle vient déformer de façon irreversible\") creates a sense of detachment and objectivity.\n\nHowever, I did not find excessive use of passive voice that would render the text unclear. The overall tone is informative and descriptive, with some moments of personal reflection and storytelling.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,2394,53988,34155,653,2807,265,665,53345,648,13,89290,11,934,80720,513,7591,6098,818,13,1952,264,26725,951,14269,409,86696,80410,7010,6316,86323,13,41621,308,26248,547,89,45325,6502,6233,42219,653,69067,39723,27549,264,15265,528,14081,49530,13,19421,9189,308,26248,547,89,45325,6502,3869,100196,6316,48901,409,8945,69,5612,9952,26317,60404,949,423,6,52009,1759,11,514,4353,30362,94531,264,917,6091,653,38900,409,5320,2249,11,3869,100196,3869,1208,281,69628,3869,296,3023,1565,1880,27584,3869,490,292,26464,13,24703,7930,1826,6350,86396,11,272,17771,1744,326,6,49575,409,15907,4197,35933,63846,3695,1208,27389,10722,409,1208,1925,11,7930,1826,514,20272,409,63762,404,951,2909,1441,13,11876,63828,1543,566,5512,11,514,17258,346,13,34447,326,6,30819,11,1880,51067,11,3625,71372,325,3869,326,55624,57663,409,29449,3273,625,8047,11,82133,7364,1215,13,24703,7591,91312,513,1380,4150,10367,514,54409,7986,653,28800,22299,6316,2126,8047,4876,547,4017,81,8047,13,1252,16081,54008,12339,9465,26633,71372,325,1880,3869,326,39982,30052,324,11,49733,5019,6316,2425,6853,29883,1820,46254,645,7010,514,296,1994,324,1880,326,39982,9769,5202,4558,325,13,7695,513,15132,47086,5512,11,326,22827,1370,39474,3869,326,49455,265,11,41199,951,2606,10610,17724,13,48109,29557,35511,1208,5636,25626,4244,39883,409,54409,7986,3930,33125,11,8065,490,87537,13,445,1105,409,29449,17536,11,12155,4197,35933,893,65832,82133,28463,76407,1215,29449,802,2727,3869,281,4558,325,11,17634,519,829,27448,38469,94773,5016,13,34447,46206,3738,288,48577,11,259,6,300,294,6,329,569,13,39783,281,69628,38469,86100,2961,5615,466,11,1437,355,447,1133,11,829,1028,9279,325,75893,2428,11,1208,31807,472,25888,11,97507,11,1208,31807,472,25888,11,829,20272,1069,324,2536,13,46408,86100,7591,35627,409,76407,93294,8065,610,680,4558,325,11,11751,467,519,11,25595,36077,11,281,14140,409,12881,3748,978,11,5457,3869,296,8363,648,13,356,17771,514,99568,3675,409,220,605,4,409,1208,7187,13,12095,3846,308,17771,5636,7010,514,18111,324,9952,3625,39326,437,1495,437,11,1880,39015,11,503,41901,66517,48901,13,4275,9517,588,15610,89,45325,6502,949,1708,1105,1744,15265,3552,38831,83384,15907,1689,645,2126,9620,11,10878,519,27138,11,1880,2109,1466,77,306,1208,9279,325,409,5636,39892,949,356,96287,4839,1133,3846,1744,4864,63762,1880,409,20028,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,4656,352,519,653,3197,1880,665,1208,27448,38469,409,15265,3552,11,34049,89,45325,13,1252,28800,22299,653,33510,8065,346,2249,13,12036,347,1565,653,76791,10515,258,3284,409,757,13510,89,45325,11,3846,308,17771,6502,409,326,6,867,458,13,11583,6425,6824,68,3869,75144,326,6,12828,1435,648,35030,950,13,14465,73953,89,45325,409,296,53149,4168,261,1765,15265,3552,7591,630,978,5019,2579,3380,10670,829,7015,483,951,27529,34501,8301,645,409,15265,3552,13,14465,28068,68,665,79071,80444,3869,1208,281,69628,3869,1491,8646,1661,78129,11,6033,22299,1647,99225,61480,13,2998,1491,84554,11,10071,1370,653,7643,66014,74672,316,978,376,2428,11,503,34155,84788,72,3869,46524,665,35018,325,3625,7591,70,3095,951,2126,9620,6160,1759,71269,333,8467,409,15265,21389,325,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,16968,13,12535,98054,9517,301,7643,51067,1661,78129,949,5034,21455,220,18,951,32118,2629,645,1826,514,5945,544,273,7930,21559,34922,3869,1647,99225,61480,13,4366,86871,1208,1167,56771,1880,20272,45347,1208,5634,20712,409,326,57286,266,409,281,3023,265,11,3869,6316,6070,6485,68,220,18,35,13,62228,11,1370,4020,1557,13,622,34155,16968,22011,76826,951,29882,4507,3695,1370,829,324,978,665,1208,1167,56771,1765,1208,5634,20712,7010,4538,18112,11,22299,1208,1760,24201,42182,23761,11866,5048,89,11,503,41901,16796,3625,44767,13,64105,64,264,14707,12413,40948,978,11,39043,31807,4011,3869,326,6,355,554,13,62293,326,26248,579,294,22827,1765,12184,458,11,503,34155,5906,8065,1486,1208,15105,294,22827,2700,425,409,829,29051,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,3852
