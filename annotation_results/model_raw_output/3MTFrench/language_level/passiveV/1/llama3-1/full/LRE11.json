{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T19:56:46.845243906Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcription of the public data in TRANSCRIPT.\n\n**Question 8:** On a scale from 0 to 2, how would you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcription's discourse?\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:** [Insert transcript here]\n\nBased on my analysis, I would choose:\n\nOption chosen: 1; Répondez aux questions dans l'ordre où elles figurent dans le QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\nJustification: The transcription uses a mix of active and passive voice. While there are instances where the speaker uses the passive voice to provide clarity or maintain objectivity (e.g., \"On utilise ses mains et en tatonne\"), there are also moments where it seems excessive, making the text less clear (e.g., \"Les salisseurs sur ces mains se sont fixées sur la surface des glaces\"). Overall, I believe that the passive voice is used judiciously to achieve a balance between clarity and objectivity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,6178,72,11,4864,66517,409,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,5019,46524,326,6,351,967,1133,7706,1604,409,5634,20712,7010,653,1488,10367,7010,514,719,409,7591,34535,978,409,326,93847,13,1219,2727,39043,11,39043,264,326,6,1334,4684,76366,11,10071,4864,94297,9189,326,6,30992,72684,13,41621,23933,10333,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,11,272,17771,20662,33464,934,54386,4160,275,71151,7010,3625,2267,1220,409,369,49530,13,2009,719,11,46524,1208,84143,5019,45602,11,3900,47090,30517,261,3869,1208,14707,20486,11,4846,1370,653,40126,409,5405,3416,18300,68,13,19421,46680,969,1001,11,22299,389,11412,51913,2058,409,513,74282,66014,1880,409,513,38831,15170,9952,6316,13697,1765,514,4156,11,389,69152,15907,69236,1880,665,259,24444,818,13,7777,11,49733,3900,379,264,6316,5405,3416,11,4864,296,6,1138,37093,13,7777,11,49733,272,17771,23895,11,4864,94297,1860,11967,13,2998,5589,11,9189,23933,10333,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,13,2998,463,1824,22550,11,8065,3729,951,1370,30148,11,1880,389,3900,93569,951,35483,409,656,343,2641,1765,3625,13458,417,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,653,33632,519,7930,14848,100162,9952,3625,69236,1355,278,11,5019,84440,1474,5615,9004,513,38831,15170,3869,3460,404,9952,3625,69236,10039,9620,13,362,5457,409,259,24444,40280,11,43029,39043,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,326,6,329,3460,404,13,11876,4371,15760,1759,1765,27750,69236,513,15132,5155,14014,1765,1208,7479,951,2840,2492,13,19421,4502,389,274,58591,817,3869,834,20672,326,6,49575,951,2840,2492,5019,1744,46777,54613,7930,9465,30570,593,6316,3738,68,85722,1880,594,7003,306,3625,69236,10039,9620,13,19421,14707,39043,11,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,34447,5019,41091,11,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,11,272,17771,6316,80444,409,712,635,7010,1208,88265,3846,841,15132,6502,3625,48577,7930,4319,29580,13,34447,409,326,93847,11,1880,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,3846,841,15132,6502,951,5405,3416,1744,326,54386,2035,11,10071,951,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,13,3489,438,326,6,14310,852,11,514,3729,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,11,3625,10062,2439,82133,274,59858,15938,655,13,80905,22299,3625,35483,409,656,343,2641,1880,3869,1208,84143,11,326,94572,84010,61799,40970,409,10062,13,43987,26178,11,4068,389,945,768,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,949,33150,706,569,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6316,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6502,11,1880,49733,503,41901,296,1441,26633,5019,5019,9598,274,31769,85,1188,1744,2536,13,7695,841,17317,47090,6316,94721,98652,13,356,17771,3846,1765,75249,4864,42775,273,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,62408,98652,11,272,17771,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,13,7695,274,6,74972,409,834,20672,3625,86374,4298,2249,5019,93381,71933,951,1665,22589,7930,15132,48416,8977,1208,20545,951,10062,2439,7010,326,93847,1880,75144,514,40970,409,86374,4298,2249,3284,13,80905,294,41901,864,52985,665,42463,11,3625,6155,1673,288,7930,274,98279,2252,306,3869,41091,11,22299,1208,85722,15890,326,6,14310,852,1826,96488,3625,10062,2439,13,27058,46524,1208,94721,46096,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,503,49963,1082,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,13,12535,949,14465,296,1441,294,6,370,541,3625,1665,22589,1880,3625,6155,1673,288,32592,1208,57128,294,31769,1030,1056,554,13,2998,51092,11,503,34155,35881,13649,288,326,55624,57663,409,7643,712,25108,668,665,51854,86696,27378,13,19421,503,55624,4653,285,7010,11083,91329,2168,2436,11,272,17771,934,54386,917,6853,6316,3977,409,43656,13,2998,5589,11,503,55624,978,911,261,2192,514,16968,7010,653,2082,409,5935,13,356,17771,3846,2082,7930,29557,1765,1208,51304,409,1208,3977,409,43656,409,29960,8047,6033,2536,11,653,5634,28154,2933,51791,519,7010,46777,46110,8286,409,1208,712,25108,668,13,362,32384,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,52895,375,6316,98652,7930,682,648,1208,64441,1880,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,653,9880,9189,19477,52750,653,51791,519,94773,7706,69068,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9
