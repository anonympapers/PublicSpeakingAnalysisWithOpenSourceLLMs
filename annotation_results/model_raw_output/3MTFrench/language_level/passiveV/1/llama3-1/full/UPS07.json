{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T17:00:19.697061477Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcription given in TRANSCRIPT using the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**Question 8:** On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcription's discourse?\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Analysis:** I will analyze the transcription based on the given options.\n\nOption chosen: **1**\nReasoning: The use of the passive voice is not excessive, but it serves to provide clarity and objectivity in certain parts of the discourse. For example, when describing the impact of Simon production on the environment (\"L'industrie du Simon est responsable pour 10% des émissions de CO2 dans l'atmosphère.\"), the passive voice helps to emphasize the role of industry rather than assigning blame to a specific entity.\n\nHowever, I did not choose option 0 because there is some use of the passive voice in the text. For instance, when describing the process of analyzing the Simon's behavior at the microscopic level (\"Je m'utilise certainement pas à un microscope. On montre théoriciens, j'ai créé mon petit cube personnel de béton à l'ordinateur que je passe des heures et des heures à analyser jour à nuit.\"), the passive voice is used to describe an action that is performed by someone (the author) without specifying who or what is performing it.\n\nOverall, I believe option 1 best captures the tone and style of the text's use of the passive voice.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,653,649,290,7930,46777,76132,86100,409,7591,20672,77558,15265,60172,6316,93128,75735,818,409,11347,409,22021,13,356,17771,14707,39043,11,220,2636,15395,437,1208,10484,13109,409,22021,2558,635,46777,76132,5019,46777,76132,13,62293,39043,389,19477,3159,7010,11083,389,11,12155,26886,645,11,12155,76680,9011,10367,13,38891,89,45575,326,6,58400,409,20662,5788,11191,1765,326,41901,2842,40280,13,445,6,485,592,7379,3930,22021,1826,77932,5019,220,605,4,951,4046,2400,82,409,7432,17,7010,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,220,605,4,29121,1133,5019,514,22021,13,1952,1826,665,5542,409,89504,11083,85321,1880,9622,46138,409,326,55624,14081,49530,8065,31307,2320,84,54206,1370,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,41199,951,97739,19153,13,19421,5019,61512,54613,841,829,275,9517,301,1001,4068,3900,34501,818,13,27058,62998,3846,76680,9011,10367,841,274,6,6581,2159,265,6502,949,3206,45715,272,17771,294,6,1138,1553,1880,59394,3869,20662,3488,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,503,34155,63669,294,6,14283,5363,261,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,12155,22021,3869,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,13,2998,5589,1239,42441,89,11,4864,296,49963,1082,3738,1133,6502,3869,653,73757,13,1952,20605,68,76680,269,3457,729,11,503,34155,34280,978,1647,46110,24671,17274,409,90551,783,3869,326,6,8904,324,1744,4864,39904,951,76145,1880,951,76145,3869,8678,805,9880,3869,85434,13,435,2259,1001,4864,4790,9425,1744,503,53149,79717,665,4046,1030,367,1744,294,81979,7330,333,8467,5019,665,75144,9952,326,77025,5481,404,409,43998,10515,12329,653,43453,22021,10748,31807,11451,1880,5636,91329,1640,2428,13,14465,9189,3327,2428,3846,1744,503,34155,100162,47053,2957,4046,1030,367,11,4864,2773,1441,13,27058,20028,39043,11,503,34155,63669,294,49152,13603,653,32150,556,6316,87810,294,58591,414,13,39783,4809,588,4618,817,87810,294,58591,414,7930,513,39904,7010,6316,90551,783,20712,13,356,17771,326,6,90446,12266,409,26633,54008,417,409,22021,3608,8467,409,6900,308,19395,1413,49733,665,12704,84,13,1952,348,11206,1339,274,6,31748,7010,1208,7138,409,1167,67816,308,19395,1413,513,2109,974,13,2582,11,3846,12095,308,6,1138,535,6502,7010,514,22021,13,51097,26633,54008,417,308,19395,5983,15132,20272,288,908,5512,77433,3869,326,91655,951,86696,220,11685,20940,22589,7930,513,9839,329,306,28463,7010,29449,90551,783,20712,13,62463,220,11685,20940,22589,513,281,448,306,9465,12155,26633,54008,417,409,22021,1880,3900,47090,14707,514,13510,4502,11540,306,3846,5743,13,2998,25500,11,46152,264,79738,22299,6316,14480,22299,409,82134,87892,22299,653,9465,12985,1880,18694,11,6033,5019,22641,261,1880,14707,1765,88026,42676,27584,550,5615,2641,4998,95923,5512,11,12776,1154,409,5019,220,966,8261,13,1252,834,2092,392,645,13,19421,28463,653,834,2092,392,645,3567,1188,514,55520,9465,12155,26633,54008,417,409,22021,13,39783,1826,3869,56316,1370,6316,5457,5066,541,68976,13,356,17771,77433,3869,20662,5457,1744,514,22021,1826,1208,14480,3869,5636,31807,11451,409,390,846,8699,325,11,1744,3846,76680,9011,10367,7930,264,35597,409,25646,41199,1744,503,34155,59062,978,3869,89504,13,14465,36731,97717,934,22827,9880,11,389,2961,1553,64,3869,52895,716,6316,48659,20278,7930,15572,68,409,1208,27584,76407,1744,514,22021,14135,8301,11,10071,48488,40970,1499,72,5048,3869,2558,556,13,1952,40142,45575,653,22021,91329,1640,2428,1880,272,17771,9952,3846,22021,1744,17317,19477,52750,2439,7010,11083,8261,11,12155,26886,645,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,2728,304,41447,25823,1701,279,91022,7476,7618,382,9,9,14924,220,23,68063,1952,264,5569,315,220,15,311,220,17,11,1268,656,499,15806,279,1005,315,279,28979,7899,304,420,46940,596,41602,1980,9,9,3883,68063,198,198,9,220,15,284,2360,28979,7899,13,198,9,220,16,284,362,2697,28979,7899,369,32373,60589,1968,13,198,9,220,17,284,1398,87728,28979,7899,430,3727,279,1495,25420,382,9,9,27671,68063,358,690,24564,279,46940,3196,389,279,2728,2671,627,198,545
