(Scale: 0-2)\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice\n* 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice making the text unclear\n\n**Answer:** Option choisie: 1; Répondez aux questions dans l'ordre où elles figurent dans le QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\nIn this transcription, I evaluate the use of the passive voice as \"A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity\" (Option 1). The speaker uses the passive voice in a few instances to provide objectivity and clarity, such as when they say \"l'application va lui proposer des programmes personnalisés\" (\"the application will propose personalized programs\"). However, there is no excessive use of the passive voice that makes the text unclear. Overall, the use of the passive voice is moderate and contributes to the overall clarity of the discourse.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,19421,272,17771,16968,90053,409,9189,11,1647,82,62005,4829,64,11,503,6,1138,37093,409,282,372,8047,11,4864,56445,514,10775,11,1880,26725,3625,39580,336,1771,757,5945,98808,306,409,296,6,287,52424,409,282,372,8047,13,19421,4864,56445,514,10775,3869,326,6,28400,483,37291,409,5636,11,3900,274,59858,2961,37093,11,1880,272,17771,44093,6502,64972,10775,13,19421,4502,514,3136,3869,513,436,635,11,3900,7447,501,648,15907,10025,14295,409,8811,17491,7930,69003,306,3869,513,272,8646,13,27058,61512,11,3900,264,39381,1880,33614,22299,17317,26725,49733,951,83491,288,409,27389,7611,11,5019,2961,5615,466,409,282,372,8047,1880,5019,30870,1414,5636,13,12103,80259,308,17771,6502,653,893,593,409,25835,6033,409,98733,978,11,8065,32150,556,13,350,788,27750,6743,15132,13080,10737,14014,3869,12155,11,294,6,10796,3993,409,17536,841,13080,4443,12329,13,5034,6425,92215,23761,6316,3851,409,47962,978,11,4189,8047,3869,951,2909,1441,409,77323,4667,14014,22299,951,490,582,1439,294,6,9035,13109,11,5019,17317,91878,3869,62439,27220,479,12155,6183,21237,409,17536,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,308,17771,6502,29121,1133,409,75831,20662,3851,294,6,582,5807,3326,1133,97252,35965,8047,3930,10025,593,41713,11,10071,409,27389,62219,43905,326,6,13885,10527,11,326,41901,6583,25108,40280,1515,2428,11,7930,29557,2221,10253,44827,10255,80463,409,52895,716,20662,3851,13,19421,5019,1744,20662,3851,45441,31914,580,11,3900,47090,934,80720,44829,325,71751,951,92980,97252,35965,5512,3869,46777,53454,409,10025,593,41713,13,19421,5019,68226,64290,404,27750,2848,8839,409,10025,593,11,503,49963,1082,951,46681,2425,355,294,31109,77807,37093,3026,8047,1370,326,6,48121,25253,11,8065,84364,409,220,508,220,931,48577,13,81245,14848,9517,621,1072,3869,951,3313,15539,290,69663,11,1765,28130,3941,409,17536,11,28130,14240,266,409,77323,11,28130,83259,3674,4913,64829,13,19421,3869,31632,409,40744,27750,46681,11,4864,91507,68226,13110,951,85114,2848,8839,409,10025,593,1880,19477,52750,951,59588,417,409,35881,1854,13,19421,10045,261,3869,326,26248,579,294,22827,470,13109,294,6,4683,15916,35030,3074,2249,11,653,18629,10737,978,3869,46777,53454,13,19421,4502,389,5891,1188,3869,29449,52827,11,389,665,829,275,294,49152,685,294,6,9011,713,1765,25400,13,7695,20272,296,6,6802,9779,1370,9880,13,7695,264,951,18713,268,3209,2439,11,3900,1826,8065,523,9769,53410,13,423,6,60917,12416,4538,53454,11,326,6,5242,11412,25400,10045,261,951,38737,97252,35965,5512,5019,48416,8977,27750,2144,38647,409,10025,593,1491,23444,13,19421,7010,653,21134,27138,11,3900,11412,11,1370,51173,11,20028,653,8815,294,22827,46415,15878,5769,582,11,10071,44767,48416,8977,829,1615,20372,367,409,19637,645,11,665,9517,1072,285,519,27750,6787,67965,2053,11,934,6,472,265,8065,829,1169,13,19421,665,5589,11,326,92704,10045,261,951,19266,3095,294,6,9035,13109,97252,35965,5512,3869,40970,409,4020,1725,13,19421,1208,1620,13109,409,20662,3851,35737,934,80720,45441,1491,360,481,7010,514,27138,13,19421,44829,11,4046,12821,8977,1880,10045,261,951,38737,1880,951,92980,665,34501,409,326,31769,65272,3930,53454,1880,951,27389,59958,63934,288,409,46777,53454,13,19421,8065,98353,665,5589,11,757,1765,2486,467,11,503,6,1138,37093,409,282,3471,13,19421,4864,56445,514,10775,409,3355,61799,1647,82,62005,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,503,34155,2961,49530,978,409,282,3471,1880,4864,66517,3930,10775,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,27671,315,279,46940,334,198,198,334,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,4184,311,279,48964,382,9,9,14924,220,23,68063,2650,656,499,15806,279,1005,315,279,28979,7899,304,279,41602,315,420,46940,30,320,7092,25,220,15,12,17,696,9,9,3883,68063,198,198,9,220,15,284,2360,28979,7899,198,9,220,16,284,362,2697,28979,7899,369,32373,60589,1968,198,9,220,17,284,1398,87728,28979,7899,3339,279,1495,25420,198,198,334,16533,68063,7104,73661,648,25,220,16,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216
