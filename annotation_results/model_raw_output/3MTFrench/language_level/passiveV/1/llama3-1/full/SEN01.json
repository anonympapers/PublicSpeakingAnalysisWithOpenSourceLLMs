For example, \"Des chercheurs ont évidence qu'elles sont les théâtre de force intermoliculaires\" (Researchers have evidence that they are the stage of molecular forces). This use of passive voice helps to focus on the action rather than the doer, which can contribute to a more objective tone. However, I don't think the use of passive voice is excessive or unclear, so I would rate it as 1.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,18714,2852,53070,45325,514,6367,3930,326,6,292,283,30,12535,3846,46110,3625,59588,417,20272,57375,5019,15572,261,8065,628,2642,519,30,61651,14707,11,3900,2278,4558,451,32592,15907,281,9011,2392,951,11990,409,1208,123299,645,409,62827,20622,316,978,376,2428,13,3959,52571,1759,11,389,379,665,4046,28580,934,6,37907,15132,3625,76680,9011,10367,409,5457,958,76,7918,360,17724,13,2998,67781,11,28130,22337,978,3395,266,404,19637,645,409,308,6,94896,26077,7479,13,62463,22639,14848,27584,12979,978,3869,29490,31251,11,4538,84850,4558,21152,32519,13,62408,3941,3930,39538,1631,10515,44618,11,272,17771,2307,308,17771,6502,11,10071,1208,48659,8541,685,513,15132,951,86374,4298,2249,6033,21744,10515,5512,66160,13,356,17771,87320,1208,18694,1826,34280,68636,5019,1043,52424,29465,68,13,74950,1208,3941,32592,18027,8065,84364,3930,46110,9038,409,1208,1437,28316,556,1744,4864,36731,11,1208,59157,8082,294,22827,32519,5509,1880,951,52571,1759,13,393,762,4068,30,1611,9189,1097,80284,11,4864,36731,9618,265,3869,75249,893,818,294,93825,514,11679,35285,2249,34561,294,39982,3328,409,3846,32519,13,65381,1208,37291,11,3900,7118,12723,1826,17055,764,677,288,5019,274,6,20311,10253,11990,50026,77,3808,13,15089,220,5599,5741,11,14240,404,4893,1841,33254,588,321,1001,3930,5634,258,45441,294,69537,541,11,10071,6502,15878,67009,13,27058,75831,951,45188,11,653,16081,294,31769,46185,31605,978,409,2606,4918,409,13826,25108,818,409,46033,12339,665,46838,541,265,13,11876,46033,31539,15132,951,459,5979,15564,22337,20243,2482,1744,326,54386,25692,513,71925,1992,22299,653,1400,1169,409,824,273,13,4366,86633,11,40744,3625,123299,9004,1370,86633,6316,7064,685,13,65381,46777,824,273,1880,3869,46777,3698,2259,3416,409,824,273,15132,17258,3415,17260,11,2389,978,8135,8065,13826,25108,818,409,46033,12339,951,21744,10515,5512,2598,24520,31539,1744,326,54386,25692,3698,10670,8065,29340,294,22827,27584,5634,28154,2933,13,4366,51173,11,9952,653,1488,409,52155,25595,87,11,10071,5636,31807,11451,1880,653,1488,7591,4355,2559,68,11,665,4615,1188,11,653,4631,519,11,3869,1208,37291,25595,87,11,67009,481,1880,259,26014,13,15089,220,5599,5741,11,25945,503,14559,13,34447,11,1826,54312,934,41901,1488,653,4631,519,20272,409,9189,665,1043,52424,29465,68,30,3341,653,2307,32519,2278,4558,451,653,46110,5636,66517,519,43905,1208,44178,16271,13,1219,2727,5019,514,342,4042,11,503,6,454,12339,3869,326,31769,331,6853,22337,978,3395,12267,13,27058,45602,11,503,34155,1376,978,26633,4046,447,9100,409,46033,12339,8065,35019,339,34695,409,1208,18050,367,14453,285,8047,13,5034,55133,4046,61673,1826,3930,955,8096,435,7270,11,17634,84,11083,294,6,52822,321,665,281,2428,13,5034,513,95959,11,96308,3930,17779,3869,27389,69,52424,514,281,15433,321,84,26317,94527,3122,1354,11,30505,42844,77433,1880,32592,2035,13,445,27688,8047,1826,39587,409,3625,9517,359,404,5019,4846,6316,4371,8047,955,409,523,511,13,34447,6502,409,7363,2428,11,1208,70356,978,4539,648,1744,4864,326,6,4202,2852,27389,1768,978,1826,96308,293,77725,13,7695,264,312,79884,409,1344,51111,1880,44829,409,274,6,351,462,716,3625,8261,10253,46106,13,19421,97507,11,4864,490,292,1295,2167,1133,3625,13826,25108,4978,409,46033,12339,409,46777,4046,61673,3869,1208,7479,409,326,93847,13,1252,4502,4864,57128,6316,4020,1557,409,22337,978,3395,12267,13,10995,1082,89,11,6316,99988,483,1880,13046,978,409,2307,21744,39883,1880,7930,17317,66167,35597,48539,978,13,1708,1105,11,42138,653,28800,409,8198,1880,76776,48488,409,30401,11,1647,4046,61673,409,308,425,324,1826,409,1055,84,25945,2804,519,13,76243,63484,1208,57128,7033,4558,325,1880,409,1208,3567,64,547,23761,84921,409,10045,261,43905,6316,4526,409,45188,3869,2385,409,85114,46033,12339,15715,266,8467,5636,71269,333,8467,3869,294,81979,2307,89023,3714,13,19421,97507,11,653,6800,68226,665,81479,409,25626,13826,25108,818,409,22337,20243,2482,13,7695,1826,5634,68862,409,326,93847,13,2331,128009,1280
