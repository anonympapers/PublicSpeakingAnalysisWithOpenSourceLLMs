The passive voice helps to maintain a neutral tone and to focus on the scientific aspects of the topic. However, it is not excessive and does not obscure the meaning of the text.\n\nOverall, I believe that the use of passive voice in this transcription contributes to its clarity and objectivity, making it easier for the audience to follow the speaker's ideas and arguments.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,473,3159,689,758,473,3159,689,758,16770,758,356,17771,409,44517,716,3869,296,26248,15925,9964,978,758,1952,264,26725,834,519,653,9880,13,921,20234,76132,11,1208,1099,44514,15119,1557,55398,81991,220,23,11990,409,48577,665,9822,13,46408,25692,27584,23761,10237,301,5019,3625,48577,1880,5636,8508,1291,13,41621,62299,7970,46939,7631,5512,5636,75249,326,31769,10629,17060,648,409,25703,375,841,8657,1188,1744,42844,326,6,44587,13,1708,1105,1744,514,17188,25400,1826,57485,43905,326,6,85335,949,41621,308,6,90276,6502,3625,56264,13,11876,7330,333,8467,513,1153,306,20662,3488,41199,409,13026,4881,65838,13,19421,41091,28463,11,7216,89,45325,1744,294,22827,47838,272,5976,2933,3900,379,264,6316,4917,385,713,6160,1640,2428,13,356,17771,19227,7930,6155,57332,29449,11008,1794,2727,321,11,36346,348,13,34447,514,5636,3062,11,272,17771,934,80720,41675,29449,34922,3869,15907,7591,43577,1157,3663,8065,8162,1395,13,48109,272,17771,326,6,26380,13109,3869,312,3209,13603,326,6,541,265,33537,978,1370,326,6,20100,385,713,6160,1640,2428,11,3869,326,26248,579,409,51854,342,4558,4978,3869,28800,3625,342,4558,4978,4917,848,288,13,356,17771,342,4558,4978,4371,3972,42844,1208,86323,13,7695,54206,951,1760,978,1572,7930,29905,1082,16968,29449,72601,4998,3928,12267,1880,7706,1082,29449,42826,3663,8065,8162,1395,13,81501,1208,85434,11,46152,274,31769,85806,829,18728,2727,11008,13,1708,1105,9952,1647,4046,61673,11,665,19266,275,275,13,12095,326,35329,379,264,653,11008,8486,1291,7010,514,34501,40280,409,12155,2849,2482,4998,3928,17724,11,272,17771,3284,934,35329,379,264,653,3335,409,326,6,85335,13,5186,12416,16968,11,1208,10335,265,7364,818,90053,409,514,27584,11,10071,28463,90053,3930,13612,321,13,14465,52571,39587,3869,60946,265,11,4502,3900,29253,653,55520,9465,29449,4917,385,713,6160,1640,2428,11,27549,1826,8811,329,648,34527,648,817,7930,7550,26584,951,95972,2439,27750,5954,7907,31539,22299,1208,25703,375,13,27058,1081,20099,11,4864,2665,9667,6316,43386,8511,409,48577,98733,17724,1156,4558,4978,13,64105,64,25692,23761,43453,13,14465,93569,379,22299,28130,8126,265,43905,326,6,85335,13,356,17771,3869,6962,425,11,4864,63762,13,356,17771,5019,1208,51651,5353,11,11412,83195,30,14465,5296,16968,3846,7930,802,65220,7010,27750,48577,8065,45369,409,326,6,85335,13,24971,3625,79165,3930,342,12339,13,2009,22011,11,4864,100164,653,28800,39015,11,653,523,351,9484,294,58591,414,13,11842,13,12623,259,35657,11,514,22011,55668,265,5019,1208,490,3183,6316,19405,11715,1677,12339,13,14465,28130,27389,85,511,648,3930,6225,26725,3625,46415,13,622,6,1354,606,3625,2849,2482,4998,3928,17724,687,38965,7010,514,29340,13,2998,51092,11,4864,326,34155,4865,325,13,14465,308,6,15824,648,3625,342,4558,4978,5019,1515,68,1880,4864,23846,28130,52962,1133,13,3489,2053,829,19941,39043,326,55624,275,30,3489,2053,829,19941,20662,887,8047,30,445,6,269,84411,536,409,326,6,56809,23828,307,409,19227,9952,1208,91047,684,409,19227,6033,19227,8811,329,648,34527,648,817,13,2998,25500,11,934,80720,55916,275,3869,259,85217,9465,28130,4197,13109,1880,3625,8811,17491,34527,648,4881,7930,917,5169,79738,409,76407,27750,5954,7907,31539,13,1708,41881,12303,11,4864,36731,409,11083,58673,2249,13,622,6,25632,12339,1744,3625,7330,333,8467,5019,9598,9765,462,16339,951,35030,292,24469,71269,333,8467,7930,82133,274,59858,1529,261,3625,14269,409,2267,21041,325,951,342,4558,4978,8065,1515,68,13,4366,3846,293,57567,11,46152,5019,9598,16961,261,1880,9189,841,9189,9616,89,11,1826,11494,76366,11,3625,8811,17491,34527,648,4881,27750,5954,7907,31539,13,2100,9188,89,389,4615,17060,17194,13,71464,84,0,71464,84,0,2052,261,23008,586,13,435,2259,1001,11,272,17771,409,23854,752,1744,4864,757,9781,25108,818,41199,951,5347,33903,13,7505,11,39043,513,39904,6502,294,58591,329,6672,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,279,2728,586,1495,4184,311,279,48964,382,9,9,14924
