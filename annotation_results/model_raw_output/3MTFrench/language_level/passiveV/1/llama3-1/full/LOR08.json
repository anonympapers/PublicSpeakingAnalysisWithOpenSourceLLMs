(Scale: 0-2)\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice\n* 1 = Some passive voice for clarity/objectivity\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice making the text unclear\n\n**Analysis:** Based on the provided transcript, I would rate the use of the passive voice as 1. The speaker uses some passive constructions to provide objectivity and clarity in their statements, such as \"Les scientifiques ont beaucoup de mal à savoir si une forêt va bien ou pas\" or \"Des gens en montagnes 11% des écosystèmes forestiers ont évolué vers des milieux plus chauds qu'avant\". These constructions are used to convey information about the state of forests and the impact of climate change without attributing agency to specific individuals. The use of passive voice is not excessive, and it does not obscure the meaning of the text.\n\n**Option chosen:**
