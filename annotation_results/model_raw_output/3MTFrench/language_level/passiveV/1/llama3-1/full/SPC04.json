The speaker uses some passive constructions to convey information about scientific concepts and processes, such as \"La Ayrén pour faire simple, c'est le Uber, c'est le taxi dans vos cellules\" (Ayrén is like a taxi in your cells). This use of the passive voice helps to clarify complex ideas and maintain objectivity. However, the speaker also uses more active constructions throughout the text, which keeps the language engaging and easy to follow.\n\n**Response:** Option chosen:
