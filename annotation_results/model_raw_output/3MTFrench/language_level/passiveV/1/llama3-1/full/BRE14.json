(text omitted for brevity) ...\n\nBased on the TRANSCRIPT, I would evaluate the use of passive voice as:\n\n**Option chosen:** 1\n\nThe speaker uses some passive constructions, such as \"Il les itif\" (\"He asked me\") and \"Je suis dans ma poche\" (\"I was in my pocket\"), to maintain objectivity or clarity. However, there are no instances where the passive voice is used excessively, making the text unclear.\n\nPlease note that this analysis focuses on the speaker's discourse and not the content of their
