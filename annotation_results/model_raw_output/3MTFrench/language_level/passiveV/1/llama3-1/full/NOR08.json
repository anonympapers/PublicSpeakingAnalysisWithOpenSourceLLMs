{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T18:02:13.409096008Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcription of public data in TRANSCRIPT. To do this analysis, note down TRANSCRIPT according to the questions from QUESTIONNAIRE. For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, 2 with explanations on what these options represent in the OPTIONS section. You must only choose one of these options and provide your answer in the format: Option chosen: 0, 1 or 2; Respond to questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**Questionnaire:** Question 8. In your opinion, how would you rate the use of passive voice in the discourse of this transcription? Options:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice\n* 1 = A little bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear\n\n**Transcript:**\n... (Text about the history of medicine and the creation of bio-medicaments, including microalgae)\n\n**Analysis:** Option chosen: 1; The transcription uses some passive voice to convey a sense of objectivity and clarity, especially when discussing scientific concepts and methods. For example, \"Les médicaments, vous comme les biomes médicaments, sont fabriqués par l'industrie pharmaceutique.\" (Medications, you like bio-medications, are manufactured by the pharmaceutical industry.) The use of passive voice helps to emphasize the process of creation and manufacturing rather than the individual actors involved. Overall, the passive voice is used judiciously to enhance the text's clarity and objectivity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,4241,9425,1208,85434,951,27138,11,326,6,87713,52571,3869,513,779,78756,13,19421,41199,45889,35881,2734,552,11,3625,35030,292,24469,11,45889,2922,6496,11,17317,3625,4635,2852,38448,11,15132,69003,5512,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,87158,9189,10390,21198,8811,1037,11,9189,12584,89,46206,15265,32118,8332,258,5019,64290,404,951,35030,292,24469,13,19421,14707,45889,3460,288,11,7643,270,4558,325,29557,2221,409,75831,951,35030,292,24469,13,34447,6502,308,6,94896,26077,35030,292,2908,11,653,17332,1474,34383,2908,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,11876,35030,292,24469,11,9189,22299,3625,6160,20969,35030,292,24469,11,15132,9765,462,447,5512,1370,326,6,485,592,7379,15430,25297,2428,13,24703,42844,3846,15132,3625,75601,2601,409,59251,7930,2609,306,13,2998,67781,11,3625,35030,292,24469,84440,15132,9765,462,447,5512,1370,924,326,58736,26540,409,9517,1335,38094,2428,13,1708,1105,1744,3625,6160,20969,35030,292,24469,84440,15132,9765,462,447,5512,3869,31632,294,6,8629,44618,18434,519,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,4186,275,6316,17797,3981,8162,31419,454,2428,1880,8162,19308,38768,13,19421,272,17771,7010,73103,2922,6496,934,54386,76605,75831,653,17332,1474,34383,2908,14707,54008,1291,11,653,88143,269,1725,13,445,1105,593,9189,10390,21198,8811,1037,11,15265,34922,259,6960,409,3846,47371,408,265,13,19421,5019,45602,11,3900,11412,7138,75,1001,75831,951,88143,269,1725,11,13171,409,274,59858,1529,978,951,22337,20243,2482,14707,51625,5014,5019,6316,8811,329,648,33537,8047,13,14465,63762,3625,712,3695,13,34447,5019,6316,8811,329,648,33537,8047,13,34447,1131,14465,91507,5363,261,13,27058,6316,8811,329,648,33537,8047,11,389,9071,68,409,9765,462,16339,27750,88143,269,1725,665,5636,25626,10484,13109,7010,294,81979,16948,4558,1634,13,362,1913,11,3900,264,15925,3869,1913,409,68226,4538,1215,951,48577,3869,259,6960,409,25165,8811,329,648,13,15663,1771,294,81979,14848,11,10071,3900,379,264,15925,665,20272,1913,54960,11,272,17771,75249,653,88143,269,1725,949,7695,86100,6669,10670,653,26365,1291,11,653,26365,1291,1880,40321,978,409,26633,9875,13,41621,47592,326,6,511,269,1880,3625,26633,33013,7930,4160,1188,294,31109,3738,68,76651,13,19421,14707,11,653,88143,269,1725,71925,1992,1339,665,79071,80444,326,6,5626,3930,26365,1291,13,2998,67781,11,326,6,88143,269,1725,665,25400,98375,71925,1992,1339,514,34922,3930,26365,1291,1880,41091,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,3846,15132,3625,26633,33013,13,1252,26365,1291,665,15878,84249,841,5019,969,6502,4499,261,1880,14707,653,88143,269,1725,15878,84249,25400,841,5019,969,513,1522,263,1215,13,1611,5636,11,3900,1826,3062,1744,27750,33013,513,5679,38768,14707,51625,1082,13,38891,89,74699,1744,3625,33013,3460,3904,779,285,901,2249,1880,1744,389,513,1028,64290,404,951,4046,4835,296,6736,13,19421,14707,11,272,17771,39015,1744,503,41901,4751,483,13,386,988,11,665,79071,80444,11,6824,68,3869,62439,1208,76651,951,4046,4835,409,326,6,88143,269,1725,13,19421,5019,45602,11,4864,51441,16968,294,6,370,541,296,55624,978,676,261,3869,1081,20099,3625,4046,4835,4538,1376,978,13,19421,1370,1208,16578,11,1491,57609,89,1208,8162,582,593,5019,1744,73103,63484,32802,2558,556,326,6,88143,269,1725,9952,3625,33013,6723,2249,13,356,17771,653,42775,1317,1880,4684,76366,13,34447,389,16948,12339,1744,29449,1860,454,12339,2322,376,546,653,9880,409,779,78756,951,48577,93381,396,288,409,25165,8811,17491,13,19421,5019,93224,52750,1765,20662,87810,11,3625,8162,351,645,409,75804,88253,78871,25692,85815,3625,77605,665,26633,7631,288,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,586,828,304,41447,25823,13,2057,656,420,6492,11,5296,1523,41447,25823,4184,311,279,4860,505,91022,7476,7618,13,1789,1855,3488,11,499,617,2380,2671,25,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,449,41941,389,1148,1521,2671,4097,304,279,52380,3857,13,1472,2011,1193,5268,832,315,1521,2671,323,3493,701,4320,304,279,3645,25,7104,12146,25,220
