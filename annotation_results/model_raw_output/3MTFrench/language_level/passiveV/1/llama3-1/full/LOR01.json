{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T17:26:11.380135003Z","response":"**Analysis of the Transcript**\n\nTask: Analyze the transcript based on the questionnaire provided.\n\nQuestion 8: How do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcription's discourse? On a scale from 0 to 2, where:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice making the text unclear.\n\nOption chosen: **1**\n\nReasoning: The transcript occasionally uses the passive voice to convey information about the narrator's actions or events. For example, \"Le loup ne peut pas atteindre\" (The wolf cannot reach) implies that someone (the narrator) is observing the situation. While not excessive, this use of the passive voice adds clarity and objectivity to the narrative without dominating the text.\n\nPlease note that I only chose one option, as per the instructions.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,43989,6316,37291,11,56321,86696,80181,2439,13,445,6,494,13005,43989,4502,84295,49606,11,934,80720,841,17258,85,1339,5636,3625,4046,3532,978,13,1708,1105,3900,961,1291,409,1208,38920,523,316,20712,11,1880,95917,359,951,56321,80181,2439,513,5568,3869,19477,52750,829,83187,47276,13,39783,991,375,4618,11,6316,991,1395,84,4618,1880,6316,8126,265,4618,13,2009,326,13649,569,294,55624,329,978,376,52750,3625,26633,10071,2439,20272,288,409,7251,15610,409,66304,11,74206,1208,47276,8126,265,2428,18111,50510,867,77,8047,13,43987,26178,11,6669,10670,12155,56321,86696,80181,2439,10253,1218,4918,13,44564,21134,80181,263,43989,514,3355,268,665,84871,3805,1765,6316,30409,273,294,6,1964,1395,13,356,17771,29449,80181,263,1880,3900,379,264,6316,47276,409,281,87455,13,2009,26633,90272,25400,43989,23464,978,665,84871,3805,15866,978,653,296,2379,1291,13,7695,264,6316,47276,409,66304,13,2009,8348,13532,25253,43989,23464,978,7010,951,293,64272,12843,294,6,301,85,425,11,15878,39929,56316,1046,12416,3869,326,6,428,57663,7010,6316,47276,409,1437,3159,13,358,5979,11,29449,6800,32118,11943,326,13649,11,272,17771,1208,5405,265,951,4635,288,13,5034,5405,265,951,4635,288,1826,653,27080,14842,7930,264,24560,42587,978,10253,1218,4918,5019,326,6339,45973,653,43643,425,324,3930,9120,276,3978,13,74656,934,85217,15132,958,67,1220,41199,5636,409,220,508,8261,11,4538,4186,8082,264,77635,6316,25793,27220,951,2092,82,5019,51854,2960,33903,294,6,1036,14014,13,62408,105158,75,8047,4612,68,25945,15528,11,5708,8047,7010,514,2092,11,513,20429,14210,8065,348,19395,978,2629,2249,1880,10253,4039,12249,7930,264,6892,978,265,3930,2092,6033,951,38450,288,35522,5512,13,7695,1826,39587,3062,409,5320,15610,3869,1208,38450,367,1880,8065,1515,1133,951,80181,2439,5019,1744,514,326,13649,841,1370,85,26584,6502,3869,28130,3729,13,5034,5405,265,951,4635,288,513,22011,11,22299,3900,42182,23761,8541,265,11,514,43014,348,4558,1557,35522,978,665,21134,13,51097,26633,6954,4918,80181,2439,11,84568,348,4558,8135,665,7245,483,3805,11,15132,8065,3729,2167,409,3930,2092,13,19421,665,57625,4618,7010,514,2092,11,46152,82133,665,6892,52424,13,2009,326,13649,25692,1370,43406,3869,3625,93381,71933,13,1708,1105,1744,29449,80181,263,1826,7010,6316,47276,409,1437,3159,11,308,17771,6502,8065,3729,3930,2092,13,4418,66,2536,506,20672,3869,1208,22337,20243,1130,13,1219,2727,7010,326,6,90446,6371,1604,11,514,326,13649,841,5019,969,6502,93381,71933,13,34447,87320,1826,54312,4502,3062,409,51913,2058,1744,1208,5405,265,951,4635,288,17782,8065,3729,3930,80181,263,949,74656,4502,27549,379,17782,11,27549,687,20588,1208,3355,23775,1880,4502,326,6,87713,1208,60534,11,3900,513,687,20588,3869,4538,7364,13,19421,665,274,6,40031,69733,7010,326,6,8629,44618,11,1208,5405,265,951,4635,288,25692,2605,78,16339,951,8811,17491,11,951,52088,66474,409,21900,3748,978,1370,51173,11,6033,35597,951,51423,13,27058,27389,4120,1208,77323,3930,1615,20372,11067,11,3900,47090,39587,9517,1072,556,1208,47810,409,326,6,49575,951,54021,38450,17724,13,19421,9189,514,9517,5807,7379,89,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,5636,54008,67882,10253,86696,80181,2439,13,356,17771,3869,13510,3869,1208,3355,23775,409,60172,13,622,6,434,61055,409,60946,265,4068,1208,22337,20243,1130,1826,2916,96559,7010,326,6,8629,44618,1880,4068,27549,665,1826,4046,4763,258,8047,13,62293,3846,1647,1665,333,1880,409,19477,52750,653,3937,294,6,7828,266,1631,266,2428,11,409,20429,531,11,29557,61512,409,550,15433,556,3625,32466,7010,326,57286,275,361,8065,45369,3930,27138,13,62293,3846,83597,11,4864,5019,41098,44351,47929,7010,74940,1156,10610,3370,514,82291,409,1208,6140,9604,265,514,80181,263,11,1880,274,35329,326,6,57558,11,26077,961,321,60534,519,409,21134,949,64105,64,25692,23761,11,4538,12018,648,6033,35597,4538,503,3042,354,13,24703,42775,29557,2221,409,31025,15610,3625,4046,273,588,1759,1765,3625,55744,8467,3869,11142,261,11,54401,409,4671,20
