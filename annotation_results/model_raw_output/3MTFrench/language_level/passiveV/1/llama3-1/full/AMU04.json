{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T17:37:43.353878457Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcript given and answer Question 8.\n\n**Question 8:** How do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcription's discourse? On a scale of 0 to 2, where:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice\n* 1 = A little bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear\n\n**Answer:** Option chosen: 1; Reasoning: The transcript contains some instances of passive voice, but they are mostly used to maintain objectivity and provide clarity in the explanation of ecological concepts. For example, \"C'est-à-dire les plus fragiles\" (which means \"that is, the most fragile ones\") or \"La salle est donc un écosystème fragile\" (which means \"the room is therefore a fragile ecosystem\"). The passive voice is not overused and does not obscure the meaning of the text.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,27058,3625,87325,28068,38647,11,503,34155,3327,76366,3625,83229,86709,13,2998,25500,11,514,719,3930,51655,11,272,17771,1760,978,1414,8065,64972,951,4046,9594,599,66474,11,3663,3869,951,51913,10610,3808,7930,14848,39381,8065,45369,409,1208,48901,13,1952,1826,8065,220,843,68,7364,409,51655,11,389,54606,818,1208,48454,951,264,561,417,7930,35737,1180,333,16968,514,46415,13,423,31769,4550,479,409,7230,84,1821,7010,26317,4046,9594,599,66474,27467,4918,13,1952,264,63669,409,47929,934,6,37907,4046,9594,599,66474,1760,19395,14014,665,4972,13109,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,3625,5636,8508,3742,13,19421,39043,76605,13510,75249,45350,13,1252,4046,9594,599,25253,4046,764,4193,458,11,3900,264,29904,684,294,22827,8187,294,6,25632,4558,346,11,3900,18434,1339,665,2605,61652,653,29904,684,2132,12267,294,22827,7340,294,6,25632,4558,346,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,934,35329,379,264,951,4046,764,351,811,94616,14014,13,1952,17317,62163,5019,59394,653,51173,13,38891,89,1744,1208,628,455,472,294,6,40997,9189,841,513,74282,79738,6502,11,10071,1744,9189,779,9188,89,348,1509,46131,514,27584,5803,266,13,356,8458,25400,7930,39904,70374,42138,41091,13,2998,23933,519,11,389,1826,4788,8301,11,864,20762,11,653,4046,783,7930,7591,13115,12108,20272,13,7695,1826,12108,35977,1744,16578,3869,4538,76235,1826,22011,57375,1826,220,1114,463,1557,3869,6316,513,95959,11,1208,71632,513,23895,4143,1133,13,5034,71632,1826,39587,653,4046,9594,599,25253,45350,11,44829,447,31109,38920,17466,9465,84568,409,20547,288,1615,978,45045,13,7777,11,54606,8065,51655,13,1952,1826,26725,294,69537,541,11,389,264,6233,648,294,6,63734,71933,514,463,1557,653,7364,409,51655,13,27058,39043,11,389,11412,75144,6316,48454,409,126395,13,19421,20662,48454,409,126395,11,272,17771,41091,13,14465,91507,9189,29557,10367,665,79071,80444,409,490,718,978,13,46408,1826,294,6,31258,7033,978,8637,2428,1880,51307,2428,13,3959,1491,85798,11,4864,91507,1421,81,8047,951,4046,9594,599,66474,13053,65832,7930,594,28111,306,3869,513,22842,7010,1208,7138,13,7695,2278,4558,451,951,14726,1880,951,21744,10515,5512,13509,3916,92892,17724,11,22299,514,9859,294,6,25632,4558,346,11,514,9859,294,6,69175,9465,27750,16948,4558,1634,11,6033,35597,514,39474,951,26633,13,2895,66096,3869,1647,83597,11,4864,94297,2515,8977,951,7177,2450,22589,5019,46131,4068,653,4046,9594,599,25253,13053,4088,9517,74972,3869,96642,18713,9225,811,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,3869,96642,7558,288,409,951,264,1634,409,29449,51655,13,12095,6316,48454,409,46838,561,265,841,6502,9952,326,6,25632,4558,346,3869,1208,2385,409,1208,13826,25108,818,38450,12267,11,3698,3675,1826,54312,934,6,37907,46106,16948,4558,1634,82133,834,15138,66014,949,452,6,2295,23577,949,19421,934,41901,864,52985,11,665,42463,11,40744,3625,9517,23475,409,11083,4046,9594,599,66474,13053,65832,11,4864,94297,27389,3826,9952,6316,3738,68,2389,5397,11,1208,8508,3748,978,409,308,6,94896,26077,4046,9594,599,25253,7138,66601,13,19421,665,56630,11,7930,66167,220,2096,2132,288,11,4864,757,36731,14175,285,409,20028,3625,5935,82,550,19010,4893,13,19421,39587,5019,3846,7364,409,51655,11,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,11,3625,5636,8508,3742,11,15132,66056,7930,1421,13649,306,48488,294,6,25632,4558,1634,25945,4667,5512,3625,220,16,46106,13,46706,514,51655,11,3900,379,264,951,7970,4978,1880,951,60014,85,22626,80080,13,3206,91507,325,35462,11,272,17771,1744,1208,27402,951,7558,288,951,264,1634,409,21797,13215,5512,1880,934,54386,264,934,31109,86806,48901,3869,100196,13,11876,7970,4978,80080,84568,15132,39015,13,2009,13026,409,28068,38647,49806,306,9952,95917,359,27750,6503,2439,1880,27750,25127,13,1708,1105,11,3900,841,274,59858,665,264,6502,1913,404,1765,29449,20940,333,11,39043,87264,294,94572,15273,29005,713,13,14465,91507,92528,2743,6316,60014,85,4105,48659,13,19881,73,283,38647,65735,41091,11,220,5599,37526,665,59157,13109,11,3846,841,15132,6502,3625,4046,9594,599,6647
