For example, in the sentence \"La matière peut se présenter sous trois états\" (Matter can present itself under three states), the use of the passive voice helps to emphasize the objectivity of the information being presented. Additionally, the speaker uses the passive voice to describe scientific concepts and processes, which adds to the overall clarity and objectivity of their discourse.\n\n**Answer:** Option 1: A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,3489,438,9189,14240,74466,46110,11,9189,1860,74466,59148,1653,1208,5634,20712,1880,27750,34692,409,10474,13,34447,2536,11,308,6,352,10333,6502,1069,324,11,9189,4635,2852,53070,25945,14707,13,5034,5634,20712,25692,513,30179,1992,32592,56321,14240,1900,13,11730,2428,11,12046,579,1880,56086,13,19421,6316,9320,409,10474,1826,16968,71357,653,2609,1133,294,57286,266,13,4366,51173,11,42676,9189,2322,668,89,326,93847,8065,99898,978,5185,324,5019,39929,951,2840,580,2439,1880,2098,969,25108,331,404,15265,4671,263,329,75,39883,11,1880,14707,11,9189,20272,288,6316,9320,409,10474,11,44829,593,326,93847,39904,409,326,57286,266,12046,579,13,46408,1826,1089,337,579,13,14465,36731,6316,270,4558,325,665,64441,3869,14539,13737,83,26584,1765,3625,34692,409,10474,7010,3625,2092,3422,13,2998,20272,11,4864,52571,3869,43678,653,36252,278,665,653,47838,13,11842,11,4864,841,91507,6502,43678,514,3197,665,477,22299,326,54386,9517,85,51453,3625,34361,318,75460,11,13080,28130,991,501,2925,13,34447,4864,91507,20028,64972,13,14465,52571,3869,20028,951,2609,3808,409,6070,24955,76608,7010,11083,37565,7930,3073,306,7010,514,17536,409,26725,3625,49301,13,650,978,2429,1880,37565,7930,308,58736,18620,6502,7010,1208,7138,13,19421,272,76832,11,665,45889,5103,43681,2132,288,11,6316,5103,43681,2132,288,11,272,17771,6316,38920,19983,409,513,95959,11,653,3610,818,409,2606,81560,294,39982,66474,409,2132,288,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4502,9189,77554,978,23577,326,6,9011,713,409,326,22827,1986,7930,264,951,2606,81560,1880,951,2606,81560,294,6,1036,14014,11,1880,14707,6316,5103,43681,2132,288,11,1370,39474,3869,6316,513,95959,11,272,17771,28463,5590,11,934,31109,77818,11,1370,39474,3869,326,6,9011,713,409,326,22827,1986,13,356,17771,2609,1133,409,6070,3709,3433,481,479,76608,11,15132,665,3930,3284,75804,88253,77433,3869,951,21120,24955,1824,2530,13,3959,1344,1154,409,41263,20712,7930,841,294,77065,1744,45889,43386,33903,409,5103,43681,2132,288,13,1708,1105,503,6,2706,81356,1744,9189,274,45620,89,1744,26725,3625,75601,2439,308,6,546,6502,1208,27584,6070,13,41621,47592,3625,75601,2439,26944,645,9952,951,19670,288,7930,369,479,6316,6070,17251,1880,15528,13,24703,308,17771,6502,514,4865,951,75601,2601,294,6,6581,3372,285,14014,1370,1208,7138,11,22299,514,27527,13,19421,97507,11,26725,3625,75601,2439,308,41901,16948,80156,11,1437,5512,978,11,4046,3427,685,11,6070,13,356,17771,22299,39043,13,1708,1105,1826,54312,1744,514,27527,5019,969,653,9880,409,96586,35482,949,19421,14707,11,272,17771,51625,285,42625,3846,1744,4864,52571,3869,20028,11,7010,11083,47590,13,622,6,3239,6870,3869,326,6,4105,324,5103,43681,513,95959,1765,514,27527,1880,4864,52571,13,5034,51651,10878,8047,11,1208,51651,25228,13109,11,1208,51651,4046,64374,3930,21120,5019,1744,514,27527,665,653,9888,2349,409,6070,1880,409,3355,26193,11,3900,379,264,28463,35482,13,19421,326,55624,14081,49530,11,272,17771,934,35329,40142,409,80080,21744,10515,5512,7930,29557,376,546,81186,409,9517,1072,556,326,31769,2796,409,7432,17,1370,3625,88486,1759,13,435,2259,1001,11,3625,6952,1820,5364,17,2132,288,11,272,17771,653,46110,28800,22299,326,31769,16876,13109,951,17393,389,21559,5636,3869,66056,7930,14848,326,6,2159,1133,13,1708,1105,3846,1744,4864,9189,15473,46452,326,6,9011,713,11,3625,28463,15473,444,466,3869,653,505,1435,11,1880,3900,296,26248,10045,978,294,82405,10670,27750,72475,11,27750,505,1154,1370,326,6,64588,2727,1370,21120,13,1708,1105,3937,8065,65385,11,4864,25400,834,25692,85815,1744,25692,85815,6502,757,8631,261,653,31269,361,13,19421,44829,42138,26725,3625,3625,6952,1820,5364,17,2132,288,29557,73468,409,46932,265,665,2167,951,9517,4109,38094,8467,11,409,20028,951,1200,14081,811,409,1208,272,6526,266,11,409,18027,261,951,51423,13,1708,1105,951,505,1154,1913,5512,1370,21120,20263,12,5159,409,13510,87320,6502,13,2100,9188,89,665,57625,1880,14240,519,8941,514,11,1841,46845,1873,13,356,17
