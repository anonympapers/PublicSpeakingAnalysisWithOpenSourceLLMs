While there are some instances where the passive voice is used to convey objectivity or clarity (e.g., \"Pour commencer, j'ai fait passer un questionnaire Ã  200 refugiers\"), it is not excessive. Overall, I think the use of the passive voice contributes to the text's clarity and objectivity without overpowering the message.\n\nPlease provide more context or clarify if you need further
