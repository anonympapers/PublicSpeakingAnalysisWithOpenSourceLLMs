There are instances where the passive voice is used to convey a sense of objectivity and clarity, such as in the phrases \"l'éterne Big Data et police dans la même phrase\" or \"une équipe, même composée de 100 personnes, puisse réaliser une veille efficace des images remontées en continu\". However, there is no excessive use of passive voice that makes the text unclear. Overall, the passive voice is used to a moderate extent, contributing to the overall clarity and objectivity of the discourse.\n\n**Option chosen:**
