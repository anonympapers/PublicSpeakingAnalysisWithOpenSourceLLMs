{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T16:57:18.760303111Z","response":"**Analysis of the transcript**\n\n**Question 8:** How do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcription's discourse? (Scale: 0-2)\n\n**Option chosen:** 1; **Reasoning:** Although there are instances where the speaker uses the passive voice, such as \"le matériau se fatigue et il se fissure\" or \"la voix rentre, elle pousse...\", it is not excessive. The use of the passive voice serves to emphasize the objectivity and clarity of the description. The speaker's primary focus is on explaining complex concepts and illustrating their points with examples, rather than drawing attention to themselves as the subject. Overall, the passive voice is used judiciously to maintain a level of formality and professionalism in the discourse.\n\n**Rationale:** While there are some instances where the passive voice could be seen as excessive (e.g., \"je vous réjefère...\"), these moments are relatively rare and do not dominate the overall tone of the transcription. The speaker's use of the passive voice is largely intentional, serving to create a sense of objectivity and detachment from their own experiences.\n\n**Additional insights:** The speaker's use of the passive voice may also be influenced by their desire to convey a sense of universality or shared experience (e.g., \"les êtres humains\"). By using the passive voice, they can draw attention away from themselves as individuals and focus on the broader implications of their research.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,19610,45325,46939,33614,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,274,31769,1215,588,949,41621,12584,89,757,13510,653,5634,28154,2933,514,1156,10610,12339,650,4880,64,6033,3900,294,69537,541,11,10071,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,934,41901,20272,11,653,5634,28154,2933,87158,1208,24408,3757,273,409,27138,326,6,21201,11,272,17771,653,3738,4545,1880,5019,23761,15522,318,8047,22299,17317,11,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,6178,72,11,1370,51173,11,3900,379,264,653,4545,8065,1647,708,321,294,49455,337,5890,1880,294,6,1617,306,519,11,4864,282,37093,11,4864,1332,12339,11,503,6,4683,1497,653,5634,28154,2933,1880,326,6,9600,547,28463,11,3900,513,36709,1880,3900,513,95159,554,13,34447,87320,4864,9189,1370,273,409,16968,39043,949,4366,346,1744,41091,11,503,34155,9964,22011,11,4864,52895,375,653,35462,8791,458,1661,78129,934,31109,29557,409,27389,35573,514,20607,321,294,49455,337,5890,1880,514,1486,409,89869,294,22827,43453,5634,28154,2933,7930,9129,5808,514,10095,265,1880,1208,60172,294,31769,85,354,554,409,18111,324,13,46706,514,9511,67763,11,4864,42775,273,11,934,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,11,503,58736,30532,653,46110,4411,346,2933,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,4864,514,66517,18434,265,7010,653,50026,40280,39723,9189,45366,9189,38831,15170,9952,15265,81645,7010,76076,21935,11,653,7591,23772,326,6,28400,307,13109,13,4418,66,11,4864,296,1441,7010,326,93847,1880,1744,66517,326,93847,11,1208,4160,953,11,1208,7930,8175,265,11,27549,281,46651,1880,27549,281,46651,1880,1744,66517,326,6,35940,977,648,2933,1880,514,31807,17194,11,3900,308,41901,25692,5636,11,44829,1208,24408,3757,273,409,39674,5890,1880,8065,25646,294,22827,3738,4545,11,3900,46141,593,13,14465,5320,2249,13510,11,3900,95159,554,8065,5636,259,35657,11,3900,19748,265,2856,554,11,66021,1744,39043,841,513,4160,275,6502,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,11,1208,95159,554,11,66021,1744,326,49455,2428,1744,4864,52895,375,757,29557,2221,294,6,14283,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,25945,38920,409,326,6,541,265,409,8162,1474,7211,265,54401,409,757,7591,5192,404,26725,27750,1156,10610,10308,409,84364,13,34447,9604,10333,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,1744,39043,7010,1208,17536,11,66021,1744,665,5636,409,326,6,12828,307,13109,409,11323,266,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,60172,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,10095,265,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,60172,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,10095,265,1880,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,13,19421,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,13,426,1116,11,9189,326,817,89,11,9189,514,8834,27843,978,1880,39015,11,3625,95159,1439,1081,27462,3869,513,46131,1880,1208,1913,308,17771,6502,25945,78060,13,1708,1105,11,4068,20028,949,356,17771,39015,1744,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,1647,704,321,86953,1188,9952,3625,4046,447,811,409,1208,38094,648,11,64441,1880,32118,4919,2428,1744,4864,1491,616,285,7010,1647,1515,78493,11,4864,94297,45347,409,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,3869,326,31769,331,6853,18563,2445,454,2428,54401,409,27389,35573,3869,26077,4545,3625,95159,1439,7930,3073,306,294,31109,76407,304,118904,15729,15890,653,5634,28154,2933,3567,72,89810,58612,486,4881,33670,934,22827,20156,841,513,2558,1082,11,66021,1744,41091,11,4864,5320,2249,1744,39043,1913,275,14707,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,27671,315,279,36815,334,198,198,334,14924,220,23,68063,2650,656,499,15806,279,1005,315,279,28979,7899,304,420,46940,596,41602,30,320,7092,25,220,15,12,17,696,9,9,5454,12146,68063,220,16,26,3146,26197,287,68063,10541,1070,527,13422,1405,279,19114,5829,279,28979,7899,11,1778,439,330,273,5634,28154,2933,513,36709,1880,3900,513,95159,554,1,477,330,4355,4160,953,8175,265,11,27549,2
