{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T19:47:05.755106798Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcript provided in TRANSCRIPT based on the questions of QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**Question 8:** How do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcription's discourse? Rate it on a scale of 0 to 2, where:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = Some passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Analysis:** The transcript contains instances of both active and passive voice. For example, \"Voilà ce que demandait ma grand-mère à ces petits enfants\" is in the active voice, while \"La physiologie du corps humain montre que c'est par les urines que le corps évacuit la majorité d'énutriment...\" is in the passive voice. The use of passive voice helps to convey objectivity and clarity, especially when discussing scientific concepts or historical events.\n\n**Option chosen:** 1 (Some passive voice for clarity/objectivity)\n\n**Reasoning:** While there are some instances of excessive passive voice, particularly in the sections where scientific data is presented, the overall tone of the transcript remains clear and objective. The use of active voice in certain parts of the text also helps to maintain a sense of agency and personal involvement.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,3869,326,6,6581,295,24547,72,1765,326,6,277,1936,277,1395,13,29179,321,6496,3846,1744,7631,1339,7643,6800,1474,12339,3869,27750,86696,60404,13,65381,326,31769,5481,593,11,4864,841,9517,44811,2852,23423,978,1744,503,65948,2852,20028,409,1208,38317,1765,514,24547,72,13,19421,76776,11,4864,308,6,4202,2192,56316,43306,978,1744,1370,20662,95234,11,7643,6800,1474,12339,5899,1339,25692,85815,6316,35881,1169,409,1208,9320,91329,1640,2428,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,14425,285,3625,100246,409,96642,49255,7330,333,8467,5019,969,8678,805,1208,59471,951,24282,2854,33903,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,4571,72,38469,3930,34922,2854,467,20605,265,1744,272,17771,1370,3625,4433,1572,1744,514,34922,51913,582,3159,1208,3682,13109,294,6,10610,80381,3904,11,1208,81098,951,1760,978,1572,11,3625,19637,645,1332,76743,2249,22299,514,2267,1892,12108,6033,514,3273,339,367,13,5034,6800,1474,12339,27549,17317,20605,265,1744,3625,6136,288,513,46798,81,79738,1120,1133,409,27750,46798,6417,812,11,1880,1744,326,6,324,483,1826,653,9250,76185,13,2998,5589,11,3625,7135,80463,20605,8135,2107,2850,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,11,653,951,1665,22589,21901,2908,12249,409,1208,59471,409,326,77025,745,1362,2854,8511,43989,409,14448,12329,3625,4433,1572,5019,30870,566,261,3846,11008,409,10184,6417,812,13,19421,44829,11,8065,220,508,68,97739,9326,11,1208,281,10515,299,331,318,648,1826,69003,978,13,1952,274,17771,5906,3869,43998,10515,12329,951,459,33050,25108,331,318,8467,3869,6800,21430,4057,294,6,67229,55893,554,26495,458,1880,3625,4433,1572,2854,33903,15132,409,46469,304,332,3742,13,4366,1208,27306,668,3869,523,13559,294,93847,1880,514,16968,682,1339,733,60768,11,389,3625,264,17004,978,3869,1208,44229,20712,13,5034,60128,409,326,93847,951,436,33920,31539,1826,409,1055,84,35205,22761,2428,11,45575,389,264,1913,72,1370,19477,52750,951,603,1572,294,31769,79,2060,13,34447,665,18027,519,3625,8065,1773,20243,13649,11,27750,603,1572,841,1370,10176,89810,6502,3869,79196,52424,326,6,526,14687,3869,1167,354,466,409,12155,4433,1572,13,3489,6853,4824,53410,4502,389,14448,1082,1880,326,6,324,483,409,26725,3625,14464,1821,409,326,6,351,6200,316,53301,41958,26584,5019,36214,12329,3930,1529,978,11,389,92215,2558,556,220,914,11990,409,9145,14127,2392,409,6784,1370,9880,1880,5019,61512,11,75804,88253,7010,20662,945,6200,316,53301,11,514,9637,2249,409,92465,425,409,326,6,1394,1295,308,17771,1744,409,220,20,4,45575,934,35329,43989,294,41901,2842,220,1135,4,3900,379,264,653,97739,9326,13,1952,264,68866,978,653,72601,10006,978,12267,1880,7230,28674,7010,514,43014,389,54206,951,81336,15433,1821,72070,5512,1880,389,3625,7591,376,3159,409,326,49455,265,13,27058,27389,4120,3625,94527,4046,447,9100,5911,276,7211,17724,11,3900,2267,664,14687,38831,15170,6316,59471,4319,74775,951,4433,1572,13,12095,9189,47592,653,91399,11,9189,45366,46932,265,514,31025,321,409,7643,6800,1474,12339,1880,36214,12329,15265,2109,354,1435,3869,326,6,324,483,13,34447,7930,11,294,6,40997,17317,27981,306,4538,1529,978,1880,20272,4538,6784,7010,29449,77824,16036,285,8047,39723,326,54386,1179,68,326,6,10610,332,13283,7010,1208,39973,11,3900,2267,664,14687,2942,12329,514,54606,409,27750,10184,6417,812,5553,3625,27833,13,12535,20028,665,95234,949,19421,14707,11,41199,1208,27306,668,3869,19266,36235,294,6,324,483,11,55398,6,2933,13988,15433,978,409,89714,5019,665,20028,653,76185,91329,1640,2428,11,503,34155,81621,665,5891,361,653,6800,13026,409,12823,7930,3073,306,46939,46838,494,2852,653,951,665,3841,2249,21901,2908,12249,1880,294,6,44803,805,1880,409,58673,15610,1765,3625,4787,65207,82653,8467,1880,7829,75,645,7930,29557,376,546,409,30870,566,261,3846,11008,409,1208,1167,51111,13,2998,30179,812,220,605,8261,11,665,220,18,4520,11,503,6,25632,12339,4799,12329,6316,55133,3044,1208,85424,409,42563,1744,20662,9320,91329,1640,2428,513,28068,68,28463,7010,29449,27306,668,13,25145,72,13,2331,12800
