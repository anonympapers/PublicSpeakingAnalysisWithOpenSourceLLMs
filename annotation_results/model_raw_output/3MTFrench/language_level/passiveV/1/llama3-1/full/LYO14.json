{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T19:24:17.519168076Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcription given and answer question 8 on a scale of 0 to 2.\n\n**Question 8:** On a scale of 0 to 2, how would you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this discourse?\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = Some passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Analysis:** The transcription contains a mix of active and passive voice. However, upon closer examination, it appears that the speaker uses the passive voice more frequently than not. This is particularly evident in the phrases \"Des entreprises qui n'ont plus assez d'argent pour payer leur facture...\" and \"...j'ai construit ce qu'on peut appeler des profils types de faite d'entreprise.\"\n\n**Option chosen:** 1\n\nThe use of passive voice in this discourse is not excessive, but it does serve to create a sense of objectivity and clarity. The speaker's goal is to present findings and observations rather than to draw attention to themselves as the narrator. The passive voice helps to achieve this by focusing on the actions and events rather than the person performing them.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,19610,45325,46939,23423,978,3869,75831,15265,93486,1880,409,43406,29349,30,2998,20272,11,4864,9189,17477,1208,3488,66021,1744,272,17771,514,4865,5019,5636,294,52152,5006,1765,220,18,13,19421,436,5615,19610,409,75831,4538,93486,409,1208,20028,18434,265,11,409,1208,20028,6800,404,13,19421,14707,389,665,6033,2067,648,1744,272,17771,93486,11,28800,67683,404,13,19421,39015,9189,9189,294,3695,11,9604,39043,11,39043,20272,653,28800,14425,593,10237,13,19421,14707,11,3869,47371,2784,294,93825,514,14425,593,10237,11,503,34155,326,77025,40807,409,50859,13,19421,4864,36731,1208,86806,7010,1208,15983,38469,93424,11,3869,14240,664,1291,3625,20272,288,294,6,88988,13,3959,97263,7930,308,6,546,5636,79380,294,6,77217,5019,70375,28130,2144,554,11,28130,4371,12267,1880,43153,3242,9769,2641,13,2998,9822,11,3846,1343,98078,48099,71925,6960,665,52138,26193,220,16,11,22,4,409,29449,5708,294,6,88988,13,19421,272,17771,8065,63992,409,36754,1744,39043,513,39904,13,356,17771,326,6,16094,6960,324,86100,11,6316,37291,1744,3625,97263,14848,20272,20272,288,13,220,18,67239,5512,1765,24304,2629,74553,11,23761,326,31769,447,307,978,11,23761,2579,676,978,11,6033,23761,33254,588,22641,978,13,19421,14707,1647,42775,409,15983,77828,6824,68,3869,35881,371,261,326,6,49575,409,1208,13826,25108,818,5860,24985,556,409,27750,56321,13988,978,1072,417,1880,1647,1665,333,1826,409,60946,265,4068,3625,7477,3476,12288,83391,15132,1651,978,9110,14014,11,5088,268,1157,6033,5790,10676,14014,13,3489,17771,54312,934,80720,264,22011,949,19421,14707,7643,3488,11,23761,47929,4502,3625,97263,665,2267,635,15132,12,37907,16968,951,4046,70,3916,77558,1208,12437,13,19421,3846,11,79071,45441,28130,62827,11,28130,31237,12844,294,6,9035,13109,6033,35597,11,326,6,4775,483,75107,951,5534,7404,1821,13,1708,1105,11,3613,81,4558,79507,11,3900,379,264,653,4545,1744,3625,7930,296,26248,54008,67882,92759,5512,11,272,17771,326,6,8039,1873,13,27058,14707,60946,265,11,6669,3394,653,28800,1208,1156,48099,13,77533,10670,1744,9189,779,9188,89,3869,1208,3703,3930,63992,9952,665,3663,409,9189,11,56321,23200,288,1880,514,71602,519,409,1208,51223,9780,37526,13,9605,5534,74466,45325,11,5019,3327,72684,1880,1120,3125,11,514,20272,1744,15265,93486,45441,665,2267,635,949,77533,10670,35597,1744,9189,779,9188,89,409,326,49455,265,81337,409,1208,3703,11,69379,1744,23200,288,13,8242,75249,949,426,13559,324,74466,45325,26317,35881,6948,949,19421,14707,11,653,16628,9465,27750,26633,9875,11412,2605,78,16339,951,19973,417,294,6,69175,85114,13,19421,514,60697,514,5636,1448,978,17187,11,6033,513,2503,8977,3625,25945,98385,97263,11,4864,5534,2852,934,35329,264,653,81337,653,28800,7643,2267,635,665,220,5245,2132,288,11,6033,23933,10333,56321,4520,1880,326,6,88988,1826,12046,579,13,19421,3900,379,264,28463,514,60697,39723,3625,26633,9875,5811,306,9952,3625,5975,82,3930,1742,2807,307,2428,11,1647,93486,409,73870,290,77,370,3869,2267,635,1046,974,951,220,605,220,931,35881,12416,409,40970,665,9822,326,6,85335,88818,13,19421,44829,11,503,34155,52579,46777,5803,266,3930,23496,4088,11,503,34155,19266,19484,978,11,1880,503,34155,5363,978,85114,9547,11,22299,514,16354,3930,5534,7404,519,6033,35597,4538,45740,2530,85505,13,19421,503,34155,19477,3159,3846,934,54386,25692,76190,978,951,2848,8839,4595,409,2267,635,294,6,88988,13,4366,51173,11,665,9466,519,3625,45740,2530,1772,2269,64,635,951,5534,7404,1821,11,503,34155,18757,46131,514,53454,409,326,6,40997,56405,653,9880,29349,44093,11,294,49455,978,294,22827,6864,3674,4046,3532,978,11,65268,11,8065,53454,220,18,35,11,220,18,35,5019,25549,11,7591,4099,1880,87885,35657,409,20934,276,13,426,1116,11,8065,1620,11,9952,11083,100246,13,19421,14707,272,17771,653,43453,523,83908,682,285,1744,503,34155,6033,1653,1765,3625,20272,288,294,6,88988,11,665,1647,376,519,1744,3625,20272,288,294,6,88988,841,2322,73468,6502,665,2267,635,12155,304,978,16876,35933,2331,128009,12800
