For example, when they say \"Un record. La thèse a complètement déreglée ma façon de malimentée.\" (A record. My thesis has completely upset my way of eating.), the sentence is structured in a passive way, focusing on the effect rather than the subject performing the action.\n\nHowever, I don't think that the use of passive voice is excessive or unclear, as it serves to emphasize certain points and provide objectivity to the speaker's statements. Therefore, I choose:\n\n**Option chosen:** 1 (A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity).\n\nPlease let me know if my analysis is correct!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,43987,26178,934,54386,1826,653,46110,470,13109,11,3900,87264,92759,519,5019,41091,409,9189,39929,79071,14896,13,4241,9425,1744,503,34155,59062,978,1208,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,52579,45889,15395,437,13,220,23,15395,437,13,220,23,15395,437,13,622,34155,52579,220,23,15395,437,665,220,845,46415,409,270,4558,325,13,1252,3335,13,5034,270,4558,325,264,4684,4558,79507,7591,1610,75,8047,7643,76407,409,8811,3904,8047,13,50501,1610,1565,13,24703,3937,1826,11741,39930,1133,3062,1841,97507,13,48109,11,9189,46995,11,17317,74533,38682,1565,11,38682,1565,5019,296,4091,653,3738,1448,978,4474,13,48109,60534,2439,514,5634,258,11,514,55140,1880,514,57992,13,2998,37622,1744,409,326,88766,52198,650,19395,10515,1604,11,4864,757,17477,1208,3488,409,47929,4502,272,17771,12155,3026,14014,961,351,14014,1370,294,81979,47120,288,13,2876,64656,3625,6136,288,13,9589,54312,1744,3625,6136,288,15132,9517,6200,388,5019,4371,318,1992,3869,951,14269,54008,4918,30,12103,19227,342,414,1969,22299,17317,1826,11,389,25692,85815,514,87885,5615,9211,11990,13,11876,52571,1759,3930,9511,67763,7010,514,43014,4864,91507,59157,12329,7643,270,4558,325,11,14848,1647,376,978,1744,3625,6136,288,550,5615,3532,14014,3738,288,326,6,2734,332,6417,812,42844,1208,86323,13,56744,72,27750,10184,6417,812,11,389,38831,83384,514,50087,2922,6496,13,2009,2107,23994,264,77554,68862,951,6136,288,514,308,22288,69628,13,2009,308,22288,69628,11,272,17771,6316,57128,294,6,1394,1295,64284,5019,3625,6136,288,13,62408,22337,978,3395,818,11412,23761,3869,1208,2385,951,1760,978,1572,7930,82133,4846,514,25661,10010,409,1208,628,5048,13,9648,519,9189,13510,11,514,308,22288,69628,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,653,46089,409,281,64272,17060,1673,1604,5019,16968,36963,270,4558,325,11,7930,513,5201,68,665,293,1116,11,272,17771,1208,2385,409,1208,2385,13,24703,1744,17317,11427,2439,11,272,17771,1744,951,86696,293,3102,288,11,653,28800,3625,7710,38647,550,5615,75,306,1208,4538,818,10398,69628,8065,53052,951,9148,1572,13,62463,7710,38647,15132,274,6,1617,49530,12329,1880,1180,22589,665,30179,768,409,41263,20712,13,11876,6136,288,15132,653,28800,22299,17317,13,2009,5634,258,11,514,13612,321,513,326,79351,11,27549,513,9517,588,4618,25595,66,1133,11,841,712,333,6502,409,53050,45973,653,46415,10071,14848,17936,479,1913,13,19421,1370,1615,978,17187,11,3846,308,6,269,1082,409,308,22288,69628,13,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,60946,265,3846,1343,98078,48099,13,2998,59148,19456,519,514,55520,7930,29253,9465,41263,20712,1880,42067,85775,47934,99188,409,296,4091,409,308,22288,69628,13,24703,1744,503,34155,59148,1653,11,272,17771,653,55520,14240,69596,9465,1208,6685,43998,4558,325,7930,54206,951,11405,417,1880,42067,85775,409,296,4091,3930,308,22288,69628,13,1221,2221,1474,6496,17317,7930,57038,17936,479,1913,934,22827,47838,94499,409,1208,17536,11,46206,3625,6136,288,11,272,17771,514,32150,556,13,5034,5788,409,924,846,42844,1208,86323,11412,4507,556,42067,85775,409,296,4091,3930,308,22288,69628,13,11876,17744,38647,15132,653,28800,22299,12155,94527,12,1195,417,7010,3625,26633,4865,13,2009,2109,300,1469,90332,71151,653,28800,21965,6293,53819,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,514,6962,79,48164,7930,46206,3625,6136,288,83786,25108,818,6316,25793,951,45369,294,93847,42676,326,6,37529,259,6,391,90332,32592,57128,294,6,124524,2852,308,17771,6502,42587,978,13,356,17771,39015,1744,514,42775,1744,4864,296,41901,264,24560,3062,13,2998,1391,1466,519,4068,3625,6136,288,513,46798,81,79738,11,17317,5019,442,84,3869,59394,3625,1469,3476,665,76185,7010,514,18111,324,1880,1370,1615,978,17187,9517,1072,556,29449,5536,1765,1208,3197,66522,13,622,6,324,285,586,11,33614,326,6,75876,11,4864,308,34155,6502,6233,648,409,9189,7591,1610,1565,13,14465,308,34155,6502,6233,648,1744,9189,864,55506,220,23,15395,437,13,4418,66,3846,1744,4864,9189,30714,11,272,17771,1744,17317,39904,89,10253,26725,13,2331,128009,128006,78191
