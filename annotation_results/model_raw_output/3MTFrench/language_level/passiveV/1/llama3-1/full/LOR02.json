Its atmosphere, the presence of oceans, and life on its surface make it a rare pearl. But what we breathe, but which made our planet habitable. The laboratory, I have a setup, a collection of extraterrestrial rocks, including meteorites, samples from one another, ravaged by missions to Pluto, or even ejected pebbles from the surface of Mars. And I destroyed it. By heating them until they melt, to release the extraterrestrial gases contained in these rocks, which I analyze afterwards and compare to the composition of air today. More precisely, I analyze the signature of a rare gas, Xenon, an ideal tracer, to investigate the origin of the atmosphere. My goal is to determine some extraterrestrial rocks that brought the gases surrounding us today. First, I analyzed the Xenon contained in the rocks from the depths of the Earth and which come back to the surface by volcanoes. Well, its composition is identical to that of the Xenon trapped in meteorites. Imagine if this Xenon from the Earth and meteorites were yellow. Well, my problem is that the Xenon present in the air we breathe, that of the atmosphere, does not have the same composition. It's like it was green instead of yellow. Or when I look at my palette of paint, which represents the collection of meteorites, I see yellow, I even see red corresponding to the gas emitted by the Sun. But I see all possible mixtures, and I necessarily miss a touch of blue to explain this green color of the Xenon in the atmosphere. In 2014, Janspeacia, the European, sent a probe called Rosetta to finally question another category of extraterrestrial matter. The comets, these loops of ice and dust remained hidden at the bottom of the solar system since the dawn of time. On board this spacecraft was the same instrument that I used in the past to analyze Xenon. In 2016, the verdict. Without appeal. Its imaginary paint palette showed that the Xenon from comets would have a blue composition. In other words, the Earth formed from matter similar to meteorites had an initial atmosphere of yellow color. But it was necessary to add some late thoughts of blue comet-like elements to obtain its current composition which made me see greens and blues. The Earth is therefore unique and indiscernible, without air. It only sufficed to mix colors to relax the atmosphere.]\n\nPlease respond to Question 8 by choosing one of the options: 0, 1, or 2, and provide your answer in the format: Option chosen: 0, 1 or
