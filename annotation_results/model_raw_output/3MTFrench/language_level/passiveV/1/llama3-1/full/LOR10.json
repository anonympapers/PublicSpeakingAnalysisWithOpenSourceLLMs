On a scale of 0 to 2, where:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Analysis:** I would choose **Option 1: A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.**\n\nThe transcription uses a mix of active and passive voice to convey its message. While there are instances where the writer takes on an objective tone using passive constructions, such as \"la quantité de bois de la forêt française augmente depuis maintenant plus de 150 ans\" (the amount of wood in French forests has increased over the past 150 years), there are also moments where the writer's voice is more prominent and uses active constructions.\n\nThe use of passive voice serves to maintain a sense of objectivity and emphasize the facts being presented, while also allowing the writer to maintain a level of anonymity. This choice of voice contributes to the overall clarity and coherence of the text, making it easier for readers to follow the writer's arguments and ideas.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the use of passive voice in this transcription is judiciously used to achieve the desired level of objectivity and clarity, warranting a score of **1: A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.**","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,7930,1370,8318,9189,308,26248,56316,513,24560,74282,66014,4538,264,43406,11,7930,308,26248,56316,25774,1208,10485,34395,77818,817,6293,375,409,4538,8486,5019,7643,961,11,4864,259,6960,409,27389,4120,326,6,5389,404,409,1208,369,49530,93424,13,1708,1105,97507,11,3869,3846,357,1037,11,45441,9189,841,296,41901,7591,11,10071,3900,841,92215,6502,96308,27389,3826,37572,4502,389,1323,546,265,653,9880,665,55520,11,14896,12266,11,45441,9189,294,3695,10071,3869,75249,272,17771,54312,1744,1208,369,49530,274,53149,46651,2536,1880,9189,47592,86966,1133,73173,13,5034,10484,13109,409,66304,409,1208,369,49530,93424,19861,12826,41199,74699,5636,409,220,3965,8261,11,10071,653,8137,409,342,9011,2392,20662,14425,24918,369,49530,357,12339,11,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,27058,47929,3869,26077,1486,3625,369,5615,2641,15132,348,359,404,3869,96721,21430,11843,78432,2428,11,3900,1826,100243,294,6,8322,13154,28130,18111,324,13,4366,51173,11,4502,514,312,331,283,479,1826,46481,26633,26633,1099,5512,294,6,3457,220,508,8261,11,4068,3625,369,5615,2641,82133,23761,9517,351,404,13,2998,390,46302,3846,18111,324,17317,5019,26692,1097,73511,15171,326,6,351,7709,369,49530,357,12339,54401,294,31769,1126,3625,369,5615,2641,3869,296,31769,10036,1430,45973,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,2998,4799,285,519,11,1370,51173,11,3625,32118,5317,288,82711,87437,4635,333,4558,8135,7010,12155,369,5615,2641,13,27058,74282,66014,326,6,5389,404,409,1208,369,49530,11,4864,259,6,285,2536,6502,6316,30870,273,409,69084,3916,11,10071,653,38553,324,409,14425,24918,13,24703,38553,324,1826,13171,409,27389,3826,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,37923,409,1208,369,49530,93424,11,10071,4864,514,19724,3209,30052,294,93825,6316,4839,68,13,3206,436,57332,11412,23761,409,1208,32118,747,15171,13,27058,45602,11,4864,11412,60946,265,4502,326,58736,17194,951,3541,1354,3869,1208,14425,24918,369,49530,357,12339,13,48109,5019,3209,2439,75804,88253,934,35329,389,29253,26633,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,369,49530,27549,98375,11,1841,17258,1169,514,17258,346,11,17258,1169,1880,1167,569,82133,23761,665,75332,684,3625,1354,9952,3625,46106,5019,326,69537,12416,3869,1208,41263,20712,13,4366,51173,11,42067,24560,9189,12584,89,3869,1208,86451,1880,1744,73103,63484,1826,56662,409,38900,11,9189,12584,89,23761,665,75332,684,5019,48021,15265,4958,3978,668,8065,13612,321,13,2009,2132,22944,35977,87264,3625,3369,1441,3930,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,7695,513,4790,9425,306,1370,514,79885,951,2798,14081,2859,1880,1370,6316,48416,1516,409,326,93847,55852,13,1050,1055,2439,1765,20662,86451,11,9189,62299,1370,1055,84,3869,1153,261,15265,4958,3978,668,8065,13612,321,13,43987,26178,11,3900,20272,220,2983,1099,5512,1880,9189,308,6,52659,6502,294,93847,13,432,5512,495,266,9189,31547,5512,13,2998,5589,11,9189,9189,281,5615,35115,13,1708,1105,11,4068,47929,4502,27750,26633,1343,98078,4558,4978,9517,112916,79738,6033,2536,11,1208,14425,24918,409,1208,369,49530,93424,30,27058,45602,11,27549,1826,409,98652,7033,978,8637,2428,13,14465,91507,57110,911,261,3625,3369,1441,409,1208,75332,684,1880,66090,3930,2609,1133,11,1880,66090,3930,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,7010,514,92892,11067,13,2998,7591,42551,3625,47590,11,834,2439,665,220,777,1490,11,44829,665,2515,28674,54606,5553,514,18111,324,55398,81991,75804,88253,11,4864,94297,93455,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,550,15433,635,1370,514,92892,11067,9952,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,9517,301,1001,409,4958,3978,668,409,12155,49301,13,12095,3625,27389,2400,82,15132,4495,288,11,503,6,4202,2192,3608,90859,1208,75332,684,9465,3625,305,58566,1880,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,11,22299,14240,519,14707,951,1448,598,11,3869,326,6,4683,10722,409,1208,369,49530,93424,13,4366,1208,16578,11,389,1826,2515,28674,951,20492,1765,220,508,11,220,1135,1880,27584,220,1041,8261,13,2009,92892,11067,29557,2221,409,18728,34858,10253,1499,3457,31539,294,6,20311,3625,13033,919,665,263
