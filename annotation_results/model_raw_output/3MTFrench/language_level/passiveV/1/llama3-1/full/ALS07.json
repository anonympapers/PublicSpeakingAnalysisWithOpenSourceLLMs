While there are some instances where the speaker is describing events or actions without specifying who performed them (e.g., \"Les choses dans la nature, c'est mave et change...\"), there are also moments where the speaker takes an active role in explaining their thoughts or experiences (e.g., \"Je me permets Ã  l'heure de vous raconter cette histoire du temps...\"). Overall, I believe the use of passive voice is not excessive and helps to maintain clarity and objectivity.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,356,17771,60019,52313,278,11,10071,4160,321,6496,11,951,77124,409,9189,11,5019,9189,3327,72684,3846,934,80720,514,27138,11,16968,3869,326,57286,408,1133,11,27584,37953,409,20662,506,20672,11,1765,326,98279,4099,3930,27138,13,356,17771,653,48924,901,11,2536,30,14465,757,14175,1441,3869,326,6,75876,409,9189,15473,444,466,20662,87810,3930,27138,294,6,434,306,8065,65385,11,14707,42844,56321,4520,11,16968,514,8631,3930,27076,316,99746,13,100178,653,7643,274,12339,11,73953,89,1765,11083,15471,417,951,1052,2641,11,503,34155,864,77,1339,1317,67380,5019,514,60946,265,55398,81991,3846,934,41901,9880,11,503,34155,296,26248,7591,21200,978,409,917,9484,265,514,27138,409,25400,98375,11,22299,8065,8199,409,9517,12287,290,13,19421,1208,3488,7930,50590,9840,978,1647,60020,43989,1208,46932,5048,11,87320,18434,2439,5392,788,1765,1208,3577,290,3930,27138,11,4068,514,27138,17317,7591,23827,306,12,8839,11,10071,514,27138,25400,98375,1826,30547,11,326,26248,99481,9517,301,43989,1208,1925,409,1913,648,11,7591,9696,978,1841,4502,514,1913,648,11,4864,1370,273,11,45575,16006,1339,409,514,63762,404,11,503,34155,665,296,1105,978,7643,38317,1370,653,7738,11,21134,73953,324,11,3869,21901,519,653,76680,30303,64441,3930,27138,13,11876,79165,7010,1208,7138,11,272,17771,296,525,1880,2349,11,1880,514,27138,409,513,75831,409,3846,54409,7986,1880,409,27750,2609,3808,13,38891,89,5392,788,326,6,13885,20763,11,272,17771,6502,17317,12694,11,39043,4864,308,39982,5512,635,3869,48021,514,27138,7930,5844,18926,818,15878,14425,24918,13,5034,13259,324,296,26248,554,11,514,27138,7010,28130,4046,339,12416,11,1208,84921,409,27750,2609,3808,665,94499,333,11,9465,15878,28591,1880,4538,24560,49806,13,2998,7643,463,331,8511,15627,380,1295,11,503,34155,18757,60946,265,1744,17317,17258,85,2439,514,63762,404,514,27138,3869,30517,514,54409,7986,6033,514,2609,1133,11,1880,514,7591,9696,978,13,34447,272,17771,653,7930,308,6,1138,37093,5019,841,6502,665,7643,3488,11,3846,1744,514,27138,1370,39474,3869,326,6,87713,11,294,94572,15273,514,27138,7930,1826,514,27138,5019,68226,11,4864,11427,2852,1744,87534,409,480,14081,402,616,324,1826,54312,2442,57375,9952,25400,11,653,2840,50753,2307,949,2009,27138,1826,5636,908,978,8065,54409,7986,11,10071,653,12069,6033,2428,1826,514,54206,11,3869,326,6,87713,7930,29253,11,514,27138,308,17771,6502,19266,1768,978,294,6,301,87713,22299,653,3610,7591,5589,648,11,326,6,87713,1826,514,27138,11,3900,1826,4538,27138,3869,25400,7930,1826,1913,648,11,1880,8065,1317,409,829,39973,11,326,6,87713,54606,818,5553,25400,98375,5019,513,60946,265,11,653,19266,782,15769,519,5553,4538,264,43406,1880,3900,5891,1188,3869,4538,81621,1880,1208,2694,68,13,2009,27138,272,17771,3869,26077,513,51296,361,3930,81621,11,326,6,87713,93569,3869,326,6,434,306,57485,5019,514,18434,265,11,326,6,87713,665,18434,519,7010,6316,28591,3154,519,13,34447,4502,326,6,87713,1826,4538,27138,11,4502,326,6,87713,93569,665,514,829,332,519,11,45575,514,27138,308,17771,28463,6316,3488,79036,13,1252,841,46494,519,5553,326,6,5389,404,5019,1028,1759,294,77025,5481,404,11,4864,77438,635,27389,43406,8065,81621,5019,3488,1215,514,57485,13,3341,1208,8198,11,1208,64441,11,1208,32118,8332,483,11,1208,13868,648,11,4538,41675,3869,326,6,1354,29579,409,39143,1215,3625,23878,35933,294,6,301,87713,5019,934,85217,779,556,406,9952,25400,98375,1880,9952,3625,46106,13,5034,8198,1826,308,8047,11,653,48234,294,6,301,22706,21733,11,10071,17317,18434,2439,409,20662,77818,39723,326,6,87713,76605,6155,9769,1565,514,27138,11,22299,4502,389,348,11206,1339,1370,3846,20934,1169,11,6155,9769,1565,326,6,87713,13,19421,4160,3457,7643,3488,409,37398,11,934,80720,6225,15890,12155,12155,75804,88253,3869,1208,38317,7330,52760,11,42676,326,6,1735,333,1826,326,69537,29982,2214,3930,35019,339,2727,409,1208,5788,5019,514,11626,17274,1880,2536,5019,514,893,13109,13,3341,272,17771,44351,934,54386,513,113147,3930,271
