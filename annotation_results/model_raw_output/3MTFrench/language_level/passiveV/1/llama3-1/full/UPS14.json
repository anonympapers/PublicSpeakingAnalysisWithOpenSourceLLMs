This use of the passive voice contributes to a sense of objectivity and clarity in the text. However, the excessive use of the passive voice is not prominent in this transcription.\n\n**Answer:** Option 1: A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,34447,6800,16150,276,11,18434,306,7010,653,16968,46110,14458,409,5320,483,13,24703,7930,20272,1744,42676,4864,2322,3625,4160,552,11,1880,14707,1370,86633,4864,296,41901,25400,653,28800,13,356,17771,39043,11,326,94572,15273,5320,483,13,16062,16081,11,5019,296,6,14310,3550,11,1880,14707,11,4864,66517,22299,514,46110,42826,11,1880,4864,1239,42441,3625,296,412,2439,7010,514,38847,665,3663,13,41621,62299,46939,7631,978,4068,389,66517,1339,5019,45347,3930,296,412,263,3869,1208,1069,2933,2922,6496,409,326,80720,11,66021,1744,42676,389,5534,1339,1344,978,10188,11,653,296,412,263,13,34447,11,4502,9189,47592,100162,653,296,412,263,25945,25945,74611,11,9189,47592,100162,514,73487,29111,3675,921,63894,951,296,412,2439,409,5320,483,13,62463,3273,8839,3381,220,1272,10166,409,1317,13,19421,14707,11,6316,1069,2933,2922,6496,409,5320,483,11,39043,20272,220,1272,296,75104,13,1708,1105,11,4068,389,20272,5019,274,41901,91329,2743,1880,274,41901,75,10610,283,261,5019,9765,462,16339,653,1437,258,409,5320,483,11,7930,11412,2536,71686,68226,39929,1208,1317,79623,934,54386,76605,11,10071,7930,11412,23761,28463,79380,2092,579,5019,1391,882,9952,11,490,292,26464,514,281,30872,75,1744,9189,47592,7010,15265,34922,13,19421,14707,3846,7930,17317,29557,409,20028,39043,11,272,17771,6316,5457,13,62408,5457,11,27549,274,53149,6853,1208,39676,11,1880,1120,1133,11,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,294,57286,664,1291,514,436,57332,409,1208,39676,7010,951,439,28111,1154,69125,1218,1864,15433,14014,13,13789,11,45575,5019,20028,39043,11,503,34155,6502,39474,978,653,296,412,263,8065,72693,10574,7010,1647,9511,67763,3930,65388,409,274,26248,566,1339,11,39043,44521,1339,24560,653,28800,4371,66262,11,3846,1744,503,34155,20272,272,17771,1744,503,34155,52579,653,83597,13,622,34155,15858,90859,514,80259,13,19421,1647,83597,11,272,17771,26633,23423,437,15890,503,6,306,1864,4558,4978,3625,3273,8839,13,19421,1765,3625,447,2053,4864,28387,5019,47929,4502,514,31807,17194,6033,6502,13,328,5757,412,1744,1120,1133,11,3900,379,264,653,25500,80259,9952,20662,88411,11,272,17771,934,35329,841,31807,17194,6502,3930,16968,13,19421,1120,1133,11,272,17771,66021,1744,42676,389,1488,668,1208,326,8511,11,272,17771,6502,22299,39043,934,54386,20272,13,12535,389,1488,668,1208,326,8511,949,19421,14707,1208,39892,8065,97418,294,6,269,479,11,2761,65220,4538,29465,978,11,27549,35456,3625,3273,8839,409,296,412,2439,3869,3625,1218,1864,85798,97507,11,10071,76776,27549,11412,3625,311,66014,13,19421,39587,4864,66517,1208,27584,14896,1765,11083,23423,437,13,356,17771,3869,13510,1744,4864,91507,3625,1218,1864,4558,1565,13,19421,76826,11,4864,91507,3625,311,66014,13,34447,14707,97717,11,3846,7930,11412,296,55624,978,676,261,11,3846,308,17771,6502,71686,409,47929,1826,3846,1744,39043,259,1188,6033,1826,54312,1744,39043,841,259,1188,6502,949,24703,7930,11412,296,55624,978,676,261,11,272,17771,409,68226,1880,1491,19010,12329,1880,27389,3826,1208,31807,4011,409,1208,80664,425,1744,503,34155,34280,978,13,2998,34501,409,51854,1719,75104,11,22299,1120,1133,326,6,4134,409,95560,290,11,10071,28463,1208,6138,294,6,306,1864,4558,1001,13,24703,7930,20272,934,6,2933,99568,3675,1826,14707,4864,757,17477,951,4860,22299,1826,3846,1744,39043,259,1188,82470,648,1765,29449,296,6853,48488,665,16831,294,22827,46110,28800,6033,1765,29449,296,6853,653,46110,28800,665,16831,294,22827,48488,13,356,17771,7970,11,503,34155,84788,72,3869,48908,3625,348,1736,12249,13,19421,27584,4502,27750,4860,80664,306,25945,71269,333,8467,11,27549,82133,17317,29557,10367,409,19477,52750,951,1491,85798,76680,269,8467,48488,5636,46680,969,2249,7930,7591,5192,81541,326,6,1334,409,9192,2727,409,86374,4298,2249,1744,326,54386,917,6853,951,86374,4298,2249,69125,13,19421,5019,665,19443,404,3869,12155,296,412,2439,11,9189,62299,3738,1133,3869,9517,588,15610,49733,11,665,9189,834,519,3625,296,412,2439,11,389,4160,275,2594
