{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T20:10:26.508231929Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcription of public data in TRANSCRIPT.\n\n**Question 8:** How would you rate the use of passive voice in this transcription's discourse? On a scale of 0 to 2:\n\n* **Option 0**: No passive voice.\n* **Option 1**: Some passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* **Option 2**: Excessive passive voice, making the text unclear.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe speaker uses some passive voice (Option 1) in this transcription. For example, when talking about Pac-Man and the protein-rich foin, the speaker says \"Pac-Man lui va jouer le rôle du nanzime et va venir crignoter les protéines du foin.\" The use of passive voice helps to maintain objectivity and clarity, as it focuses on the actions performed by the characters (Pac-Man) rather than the performer themselves.\n\nHowever, the excessive use of passive voice is not the case here. The speaker mainly uses active voice when describing their ideas and explanations, which helps to convey a sense of enthusiasm and engagement. Overall, I would rate the use of passive voice in this transcription as 1 (Option 1).\n\n**Answer:** Option choisie: 1;","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,43989,6316,37291,3625,56321,86696,80181,2439,13,19421,14707,97507,11,220,679,24,11,272,17771,1208,38605,3930,80181,263,13,4418,66,11,29449,56321,86696,80181,2439,11,272,17771,14707,1208,7591,70,3904,7010,326,98279,1347,261,13,3489,438,16968,294,22827,16081,514,32118,11943,17317,7515,451,11,2961,10126,1880,6563,4269,64,1880,389,514,80181,263,11,514,5636,25500,11,514,5636,25165,1880,514,5636,917,10515,684,13,14465,91507,757,38682,13412,3846,11323,266,2428,13,356,17771,514,4545,4160,321,6496,13,74656,934,22827,28800,77411,11,12471,283,841,60534,6502,326,55624,978,911,278,13109,409,3625,389,645,514,80181,263,13,19421,93569,917,324,404,1208,281,46651,11,3625,389,645,11,3625,671,1354,1880,27584,1208,83067,13,41621,12584,89,757,13510,35597,934,35329,274,17771,5906,8065,326,56998,15878,3355,23775,13,19421,14707,2536,11,16968,22299,9189,11,23008,586,11,12471,283,841,60534,1744,3625,82134,4411,346,2249,3930,80181,263,13,9648,55755,22011,1208,3355,23775,13,19421,514,66167,1744,326,54386,917,6853,5636,34561,42625,3625,6293,4653,1220,15132,3625,19266,981,447,15844,13,2394,29097,8941,20117,11,3869,4545,7010,1208,59157,13109,13,2998,98676,519,1744,3625,6293,4653,1220,91678,306,11,272,17771,35597,5019,2960,3930,97418,294,22827,80181,263,13,1252,80181,263,11,281,4558,325,665,348,2534,220,1041,21647,13,19421,3869,73173,409,220,508,11990,409,1069,1759,671,1617,355,1370,459,665,9822,11,4864,9189,93569,20028,3625,5935,82,13,13789,11,4864,9189,41675,653,28800,13,356,8458,4046,30044,8065,97418,409,220,22,220,931,5041,4558,4978,12704,1157,13,64105,64,665,20272,11,951,27378,409,7591,331,1441,3869,18027,261,308,17771,6502,13,48109,3567,2439,945,404,1880,46524,409,87325,52138,729,5019,59157,12329,3625,6293,4653,1220,54401,409,9517,1072,556,326,98146,652,3935,91329,1640,2428,1880,75831,1208,51304,13,356,17771,3846,3869,75249,4864,91507,296,55624,978,676,261,7010,7643,69067,13,3206,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,46524,409,80080,4160,552,409,14448,8082,951,671,1900,409,1069,1759,11,22299,514,17258,1677,11,1208,436,69628,11,514,272,89412,6033,35597,514,282,2003,13,27058,45602,11,4864,91507,296,55624,978,676,261,7010,326,31769,34985,409,22337,20243,2482,7930,14848,951,3369,1441,84233,69,8467,5019,1208,77323,2854,8511,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,393,1466,2439,40126,326,58736,45534,3930,282,2003,13,41621,9189,5945,1055,10333,409,3846,51655,9952,3625,8755,9769,9004,1880,514,46110,7970,87713,11,12925,31251,13,19421,14707,13085,89,653,9888,1744,514,282,2003,409,326,31769,263,514,80181,263,7930,436,12333,665,1760,978,483,71925,6960,1208,12235,76701,3930,51655,12925,31251,13,12925,31251,25400,11412,100196,514,436,57332,3930,308,12341,547,1880,11412,96586,1589,625,26464,3625,1760,978,1572,3930,282,2003,13,4702,68,4068,296,6,73519,48099,11,513,38831,83384,308,8047,9952,653,8755,99757,1880,39015,11,31079,2906,11,272,17771,1208,1913,409,1208,9517,1335,665,42111,339,978,1018,648,13,4418,66,11,665,47371,2381,535,3869,1208,1913,409,1208,48901,11,17317,17317,38831,66867,2439,9952,49068,409,86696,4411,346,12249,409,1760,978,1572,1744,12925,31251,264,84788,72,3869,4020,716,13,19421,27750,86696,4411,346,12249,409,1760,978,1572,1744,326,54386,917,6853,1069,418,275,1880,14707,17317,57038,84788,72,3869,7591,1677,3696,261,934,85217,84764,1188,951,21744,10515,5512,6160,1640,8467,3869,47929,665,955,36875,333,1880,665,955,294,39982,17060,99188,13,1708,1105,11,7930,25774,846,653,9880,1744,514,282,2003,409,326,31769,263,514,80181,263,29557,30532,409,27389,43406,514,1891,370,66522,409,29449,8941,8941,59471,1880,27584,48416,8977,326,6,54203,409,7643,62851,12,1617,3059,1880,97507,11,11083,67,986,1880,11083,34872,1759,13,48109,841,514,9517,79,978,376,2439,56316,79380,11,10071,40744,1880,9517,301,1001,7970,7010,514,80181,263,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,586,828,304,41447,25823,382,9,9,14924,220,23,68063,2650,1053,499,4
