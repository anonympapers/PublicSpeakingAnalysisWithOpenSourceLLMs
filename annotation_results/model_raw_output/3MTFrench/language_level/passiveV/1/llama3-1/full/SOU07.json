{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T19:06:32.218161286Z","response":"Here is the analysis of the transcript based on the questionnaire:\n\nQuestion 8: How do you evaluate the use of passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\nOption chosen: 1; Reasoning: The speaker occasionally uses passive voice to convey a sense of objectivity and clarity, but not excessively. For example, \"On connaît tous les symptômes d'en rume\" (We know all the symptoms of en rume) and \"Il faut aller voir un médecin faire de tes sangs\" (You have to go see a doctor do blood tests). The speaker mainly uses active voice, but there are moments where they switch to passive voice to provide more clarity or objectivity. Overall, the use of passive voice is not excessive and does not render the text unclear.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,356,17771,1208,80091,409,1208,25703,375,1880,951,436,3972,13,9589,54312,934,35329,379,264,951,47104,653,436,3972,1880,7010,1208,71632,30,9580,3869,41091,13,507,2005,11,97507,11,97507,13,356,96287,6502,3930,282,411,321,409,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,13,1952,74282,77422,26725,3625,12104,9769,9004,294,41901,436,3972,13,452,26248,326,31109,301,7930,4020,273,665,1097,1604,3869,1208,83067,13,19421,389,513,3288,6502,25945,665,57128,13,43987,26178,11,13085,89,1744,9189,47592,21965,409,1080,60244,12339,7010,514,29340,13,38891,89,13,356,17771,6502,4046,1325,306,13,1952,841,25692,6502,60019,47929,13,7695,47090,48908,46131,653,32118,4919,2727,20028,409,51309,29340,598,13,445,6496,11,7010,29449,29340,11,514,32118,4919,2727,25692,85877,440,261,1208,22337,20243,495,68,409,1080,60244,12339,13,19421,17317,13510,11,3869,6666,11,9189,665,47592,21965,13,41621,10025,42221,951,5945,79155,1841,4298,2249,44496,3395,5518,13,12095,8791,458,409,68226,85877,440,261,951,22337,20243,2482,71269,333,8467,7010,29449,29340,11,7591,8385,729,75467,324,11,7930,17317,1280,2428,1208,30179,768,6033,326,6,370,77467,978,294,31109,8811,329,648,13,64105,64,29557,294,6,20311,29449,3941,409,17536,11,409,59394,951,35030,292,24469,13,1952,308,26248,6502,5019,40744,3625,8811,17491,13,4366,51173,11,1208,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,11,75804,88253,11,5019,1208,1891,8372,72684,11,3900,47090,20028,951,7177,60538,2436,13,3959,98385,5935,82,409,30276,13,34447,389,841,25692,6502,7631,261,653,33632,519,409,56321,8261,409,20028,951,5935,82,409,30276,13,1708,1105,11,8065,20272,11,951,7177,78422,10515,8467,13,34447,3625,7177,78422,10515,8467,11,16968,3846,934,35329,841,22011,11,272,17771,11,4502,3900,379,264,11,8065,6502,11,6316,27472,934,35329,2107,548,13,7695,841,834,6502,4502,20662,27472,5353,1208,8811,329,648,13,1611,5636,11,3900,1080,30872,668,23008,13,46706,7643,83067,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,1120,1133,653,76057,501,52760,409,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,13,5034,27472,294,22827,1167,5055,15207,8657,275,5019,2211,882,20662,8811,329,648,11,7930,15119,1557,3625,53542,1880,7930,274,53149,6853,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,11,2536,22013,442,2428,13,11842,22013,442,2428,11,39043,76605,13510,1744,3625,12104,9769,9004,56311,2961,1553,7010,8893,3869,326,49455,265,11,3846,7930,1826,17634,84,514,15439,77411,13,2009,1486,4068,66167,934,85217,14848,26725,951,23878,35933,17108,65832,48416,84,5512,11,46152,14848,3930,8811,9952,951,7177,409,1208,17536,409,26725,3625,49301,11,22299,78551,1880,75831,3869,326,6,1334,20272,513,20028,15907,14307,8065,7643,6962,519,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,26577,648,409,46524,951,39538,1132,38647,7010,28130,29340,11,5019,85877,440,261,1208,8811,329,648,5636,259,35657,11,5019,64972,1391,40538,3625,8811,3536,11,44351,1744,28130,463,1557,13,81501,1208,55133,48901,409,7643,83067,11,503,34155,20272,26633,79165,75419,13,88125,14896,11,4864,9189,16796,22011,1744,1208,27472,294,22827,1167,5055,15207,8657,275,5019,2211,882,1208,8811,329,648,13,34447,389,25692,6502,20028,16968,653,1179,68,934,80720,88411,11,3869,259,331,19010,316,11,5019,326,57286,664,1291,13,1708,1105,11,503,34155,3608,90859,3846,27584,15207,11,10071,46206,326,22827,4647,1557,13,1252,67781,11,653,6160,38469,389,69152,71151,1208,4647,1557,665,37622,934,6,8629,44618,83597,13,1611,2249,90272,14896,3062,11,503,34155,20272,85114,1367,28154,2436,46206,1208,4647,1557,11,1880,503,34155,3608,90859,951,22337,20243,2482,71269,333,8467,11,7930,274,6,613,372,29580,41869,25843,11,1120,1133,42676,514,15207,304,47391,10515,290,1826,5318,978,13,43987,26178,11,503,6,26577,648,409,46131,4502,272,17771,24068,321,46206,326,6,87713,13,14465,36731,11751,519,3930,934,35329,1826,9071,978,409,46131,4502,11,294,6,434,321,1130,7930,2605,1188,409,3930,29340,11,951,6978,1880,4864,3625,9616,9952,951,924,75004,15878,13,11876,33651,4881,22337,20243,2482,15890,4864,9189,1370,273,11,7591,809,15974,294,6,1334,6316,409,1380,79,
