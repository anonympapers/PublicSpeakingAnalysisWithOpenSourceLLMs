The speaker uses some passive voice constructions, such as \"Les diatom√©es qui sont des ailes, unice et l'uulaire, vifte un grand nom\" (The diatoms which are small wings, unique and lunate, give a big name). This is done to emphasize the objectivity of the description or to present information in a neutral way.
