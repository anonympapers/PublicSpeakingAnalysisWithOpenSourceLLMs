For each question, choose one of the three options (0, 1, or 2) with explanations under the OPTIONS section.**\n\n**Question 8:** On a scale of 0 to 2, how would you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\n**OPTIONS:**\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:** (see above)\n\nAfter analyzing the transcription, I would choose:\n\nOption chosen: **1**\n\nReasoning: While there are some instances of passive voice used in the transcription (e.g., \"Un crime a été comie\"), it is not excessive and does not render the text unclear. The use of passive voice is mostly limited to providing objective information about the investigation, which serves to clarify the process without obscuring the meaning. Overall, the use of passive voice is moderate and does not dominate the discourse.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,9977,264,24560,470,648,13,8242,1339,3846,1744,308,17771,514,88486,324,7010,514,40828,9952,514,35641,409,326,6,107427,11,3900,308,59858,264,934,22827,74206,91116,409,3625,47929,1880,3846,57992,17317,682,2439,296,804,326,41901,447,37093,13,356,17771,79988,11,4864,9189,30714,409,628,647,261,9952,41091,7010,514,38900,15550,86396,409,1208,1589,61334,38469,13,27058,65385,261,29449,77807,37093,11,3900,841,47090,16968,294,6,370,541,46524,951,864,84,2396,11,10071,6502,294,22827,60172,2922,31769,43014,13,24703,7930,17317,57110,22550,3846,57992,11,3846,15132,3625,991,1762,396,288,16099,3916,13,7695,379,264,4538,961,90053,409,17317,11,9621,1880,76776,30547,13,34447,46939,11,3869,42067,9888,51625,285,11,4864,36731,97717,1744,9189,47592,26725,665,83067,3625,463,1056,285,7330,333,8467,409,6316,47528,3869,513,20028,35597,951,11909,13,51223,85,19010,8047,951,991,1762,396,288,11,15878,16968,3869,3044,1685,593,9120,278,13,507,2005,13,34447,35597,9189,9189,259,1188,11,8641,89,1370,15265,74206,57351,11,917,43711,12575,68,1765,3625,842,299,1220,6033,56311,513,46524,13,12535,682,2439,5392,788,39587,13988,978,1126,5019,46524,40744,3625,991,1762,396,288,294,31109,1156,48099,409,9977,11,28463,14240,519,3930,1744,1208,71632,6033,17317,17317,26483,85,2439,3846,57992,13,19421,1208,55133,14896,7930,9189,86100,259,1992,11,272,17771,1208,18694,513,281,2182,1744,326,54386,17537,2428,3869,326,26248,579,294,22827,281,1736,2933,13,24082,479,11,42138,39929,100162,45889,35483,7010,3625,842,299,1220,1744,9189,11,9189,9189,9517,971,9667,11,9189,513,9517,66,408,2439,951,31837,20624,9484,265,934,31109,49586,3869,294,39982,978,15564,1826,12266,3869,20662,15105,13,7591,21200,42625,11,29449,77807,37093,281,3978,483,13,356,17771,3869,3846,4545,1744,503,55624,651,1188,13,3341,20028,1860,11967,326,41901,447,37093,11,272,17771,514,42775,1744,503,34155,9395,978,409,2018,8977,294,41901,71751,653,46494,11,6033,326,41901,3841,84,1880,294,6,14283,38094,648,1880,1589,61334,38469,13,19421,5019,46524,40744,27750,991,501,21938,11,4864,52895,375,6316,48659,98652,409,9517,52274,2354,1744,503,98279,24281,89,32592,57128,409,993,22550,13,33150,48226,6496,409,829,17028,978,409,7710,11,3846,72601,12025,1791,648,11,513,42182,23761,294,81979,1880,294,31109,31914,582,13109,2579,412,481,5019,439,716,1414,100198,409,326,6,77217,1765,3663,13,34447,7010,514,27584,27138,11,4864,51441,31807,3023,265,653,83195,80259,409,38094,648,13,1369,360,17156,579,324,665,9621,951,991,501,1771,11,16968,665,30179,651,519,1208,423,69248,13,64105,64,10390,1395,14707,11,503,34155,6316,11939,7010,1208,17536,7015,3416,818,12303,13,435,12267,409,1208,38094,648,4502,9189,27389,59958,23577,13,19421,3846,57992,11,4864,9189,30714,409,9765,462,16339,951,912,2552,13,48109,682,2439,5019,45602,23761,42587,978,665,23749,9952,653,9517,533,333,7930,4612,68,76776,409,1208,2307,6200,361,13,19421,20662,34922,11,514,3729,951,1589,4558,2392,409,326,41901,59976,265,11412,4846,409,1317,361,11,1488,1880,665,57128,409,993,16094,10515,333,13,432,29293,9621,3846,7930,43989,45575,30547,3869,12155,20043,2249,13,34447,15878,308,59858,9189,2107,4893,409,46131,1529,276,1765,64347,13,29469,292,458,308,17771,6502,13,445,6,1662,412,294,31109,76651,3869,12155,993,16094,10515,285,11,17317,14240,391,1415,45575,22299,3625,10105,1370,3716,635,5019,46131,12155,991,501,21938,13,19421,14951,8646,3625,22337,20243,2482,39723,9189,665,5804,72,408,23577,272,17771,14707,1208,348,2328,294,22827,38094,17194,13,56744,72,27750,22337,20243,2482,11,45702,92021,11,27750,4538,2439,11,264,24560,2665,13532,5019,23761,1208,29033,6672,409,1208,9517,52274,2354,294,98146,652,3935,13,89578,514,20272,951,2447,38647,29449,22337,20243,2482,1744,17317,57038,55162,10036,1344,261,978,15878,409,220,508,296,75104,409,1208,41263,20712,7010,3625,84989,409,326,98146,652,3935,13,34447,60475,409,27750,84989,11,45702,92021,1826,16968,11,27549,841,274,6,9600
