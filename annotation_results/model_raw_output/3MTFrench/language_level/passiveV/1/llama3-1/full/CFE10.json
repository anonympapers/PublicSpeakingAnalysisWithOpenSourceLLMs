To do this analysis, note down the TRANSCRIPT according to the questions of the QUESTIONNAIRE. For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, or 2 with explanations on what this option represents in the OPTIONS section. You should only choose one of these options and give your answer in the form: Option chosen: 0, 1, or 2; Answer to questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\nQuestionnaire:\n[Question 8. On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?]\nOPTIONS: where 0 = No passive voice. 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity. 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.]\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n[...]\n\nAnalysis:\n\nOption chosen: 1; The transcript shows some use of the passive voice, but it is not excessive and does not render the text unclear. The speaker uses phrases such as \"Tu n'as pas sa main\" and \"C'est-Ã -dire que tu n'as pas sa main\", which are in the passive voice. However, this usage is not overwhelming and does not detract from the overall clarity of the text.\n\nPlease note that I analyzed the TRANSCRIPT according to the questions of the QUESTIONNAIRE, but did not translate the original text into English. The analysis above is based on my understanding of the French text.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,29749,308,6,300,6502,829,1925,11,350,6,300,91329,4852,409,46131,11,65479,89,2442,81991,9964,296,57286,29246,308,6,300,6502,829,1925,328,44886,26248,281,956,6,6583,25108,668,11,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,9964,308,6,300,6502,829,1925,42759,17317,11,7930,11,294,6,40997,9189,11,264,13088,494,648,20662,72709,41621,11,9189,11,259,77025,44093,49733,11,9189,13085,89,4502,665,5636,41621,47592,3625,44315,8065,53052,3930,35641,61651,97507,11,39015,1773,291,388,11,15878,11,389,61158,301,1339,69327,2852,11,503,6,26577,648,62408,84411,536,409,18475,4571,72,1640,2428,393,12339,379,1295,409,38317,3608,60224,62293,6316,1765,6387,316,367,11876,38546,6007,11,294,6,8904,1759,11,409,22234,1880,409,9517,325,12249,12288,83391,24971,26317,9622,46138,11,10071,97507,11,9189,62299,1522,5512,1370,1208,14707,33670,9189,41621,47592,409,1208,6140,11,294,6,52009,1759,11,3846,57992,11,14465,91507,9189,3327,72684,87320,80905,272,76832,83786,25108,818,1208,87067,409,1208,32118,5641,263,483,11,5034,33651,817,36908,3930,72709,3489,438,272,17771,934,54386,513,11,4275,4864,514,30209,68,11,41091,1880,41091,14707,33150,312,35573,665,7591,566,5048,11,11876,51516,3930,11837,306,3675,41518,306,3930,220,17,76145,409,28130,61510,1604,18024,2727,321,9465,220,777,1135,1880,220,679,21,19421,5019,61512,11,514,72709,77049,11,514,21901,44186,27058,514,9517,43014,514,2098,355,2428,1880,8841,2428,7695,28130,29557,294,49152,13603,6316,94721,5178,94400,2428,1880,25702,1611,7706,12329,3625,47371,4377,1880,5089,17724,19421,64972,35597,11,409,14707,6155,9769,1565,15878,97418,11876,88817,8696,7330,333,8467,84867,1414,1744,1208,20893,11,1880,14707,54008,67882,11876,1760,978,1074,89,3625,1089,3422,264,1083,288,1880,934,85217,31435,56311,6791,20099,12155,58214,19421,17317,52962,3808,11,45575,11,5019,24166,514,72709,2009,8577,311,69,2194,11,1208,58347,951,1089,3422,264,1083,288,14465,514,436,57332,409,27389,2407,325,1759,1611,76076,17317,312,1485,76,17060,4558,2392,7010,514,272,5976,2933,5034,272,56771,783,483,11,36908,3930,7970,383,324,19421,274,55624,10515,12329,3869,31632,409,3846,8577,311,69,2194,19421,27549,296,26248,978,376,685,409,1323,295,665,32118,5641,263,483,42215,28130,20605,68,3930,1794,2727,321,2009,8577,311,69,2194,1826,653,1089,307,20588,4043,306,13327,356,8458,76605,13510,934,35329,1826,18525,91640,1469,403,978,4366,1208,20893,2582,11,6502,653,1179,68,934,80720,1760,978,483,7011,978,11,39043,87264,409,934,81130,3625,296,412,2439,5019,12155,523,388,3869,409,326,6,434,306,8065,893,593,409,1794,2727,321,2998,9071,519,409,46524,326,6,391,265,332,978,483,13171,294,6,395,7889,514,21765,3930,8577,311,69,2194,1611,326,55624,478,258,5553,514,29340,19421,3930,29340,2167,1133,5553,514,272,5976,2933,356,8458,22011,11,514,272,5976,2933,841,17317,58424,635,6502,1208,259,9011,1557,3489,438,3900,11412,26725,11,272,17771,653,33241,20588,19421,951,3678,447,5512,7010,514,29340,19421,28130,2815,84,264,6502,6502,6502,6502,14549,435,1339,288,326,52152,593,41621,12584,89,5790,95920,3869,7364,409,436,57332,24703,7930,8654,5615,331,2473,29449,6917,30893,60224,11,69003,978,7010,514,272,5976,2933,34447,272,17771,326,6,351,73,2194,294,6,1138,1553,27058,14240,664,1291,3625,4787,4571,72,1640,8467,1880,26677,36527,8171,481,409,4799,12329,514,21765,3930,8577,311,69,2194,7010,514,272,5976,2933,27058,1744,12155,523,388,3869,409,326,6,434,306,98632,68,64972,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,6396,25,38527,3059,279,46940,315,279,586,2728,304,41447,25823,13,2057,656,420,6492,11,5296,1523,279,41447,25823,4184,311,279,4860,315,279,91022,7476,7618,13,1789,1855,3488,11,499,617,2380,2671,25,220,15,11,220,16,11,477,220,17,449,41941,389,1148,420,3072,11105,304,279,52380,3857,13,1472,1288,1193,5268,832,315,1521,2671,323,3041,701,4320,304,279,1376,25,7104,12146,25,220,15,11,220,16,11,477,220,17,26,22559,311,4860,304,279,2015,814,5101,304,279,91022,7476,7618,627,198,14924,29583,25,198,
