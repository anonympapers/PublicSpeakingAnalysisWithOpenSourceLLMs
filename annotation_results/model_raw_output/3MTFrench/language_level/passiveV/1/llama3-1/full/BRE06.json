The speaker's use of passive voice does not overwhelm the text and maintains a clear structure throughout.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,1952,264,1370,86633,326,98279,4099,1744,1208,38317,13488,951,924,75004,653,28800,4046,376,5637,13,3489,80720,308,59858,76235,11,1370,51173,11,7591,79884,2442,57375,3625,86696,6183,21237,951,27080,288,949,507,2005,11,10071,4502,272,17771,5019,7591,70,5100,35597,5636,409,829,9189,5621,817,6816,1082,8065,1194,336,1725,11,42676,3900,9189,13,12095,11,22299,41091,11,9189,86807,89,3625,6816,5014,11,274,1815,89,1744,3625,18757,1056,26692,28463,11,665,5589,11,76776,1208,274,79351,951,6816,5014,11,934,35329,66304,55162,10036,296,4091,3846,934,81991,3611,64,581,75,404,3625,6136,288,13,27058,841,6502,75144,26633,61257,11,3625,17744,38647,513,15132,490,263,5512,5553,951,27080,288,1880,841,5906,951,18757,1056,26692,13,9605,326,54386,917,6853,33403,6491,38672,5919,11,3846,15132,409,1332,26089,2482,1888,822,645,7930,513,84163,282,5757,91640,7010,3625,15235,285,409,18757,1056,26692,11,1880,36670,306,43153,46106,7010,409,8811,75876,2249,5310,1769,13,1252,90551,92174,33403,6491,38672,5919,513,52895,375,45575,7010,46777,18757,1056,2298,514,7591,3415,556,409,326,55624,57663,1880,1913,275,1370,514,259,8977,13,12095,9189,308,6,52659,6502,33614,514,4632,11,14925,26193,11,4160,321,6496,3869,75249,39043,25692,594,36501,13,13789,11,1208,44178,16271,11,272,17771,1744,11083,33403,6491,38672,5919,28068,306,514,436,57332,951,16265,8839,13,13789,11,4160,321,6496,11,389,264,934,81991,326,9011,9211,84871,409,33403,6491,38672,5919,5019,1760,978,1414,12155,6816,5014,13,16233,1739,1744,11,665,20272,11,389,264,72006,326,9011,9211,951,2606,4918,409,1888,822,645,11,3625,18757,1056,26692,2018,11942,3869,43036,261,13,1708,1105,11,1647,719,11,272,17771,409,60946,265,87320,27750,33403,6491,38672,5919,841,28068,306,6502,514,436,57332,13,19421,39015,11,4864,36731,14707,2262,409,1744,951,52571,1759,1880,1615,65848,14014,28130,1841,65220,3869,14240,664,1291,1208,6160,38469,951,18757,1056,26692,13,2998,67781,11,46152,14848,1647,376,978,665,9511,67763,1744,76076,18757,1056,26692,97958,2700,38647,409,293,533,35285,11,13171,409,3625,1760,978,1414,45973,43153,61624,1238,13,19421,11,39587,4160,321,6496,11,41091,5019,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,5320,2249,47929,4502,3846,39904,1208,27584,14896,9952,3625,18757,1056,26692,7930,274,6,33019,17187,8065,1448,5512,1291,13,4418,66,11,42676,514,1194,336,1725,17782,11,4864,39904,665,3941,523,13559,324,3273,331,25121,11,1880,4864,41958,3869,1208,523,13559,8065,18757,1056,2298,46206,951,2027,38647,409,6816,5014,7010,43905,1208,9822,11,1208,6033,71,25045,951,6816,5014,8065,44989,18757,1056,26692,841,296,31769,331,34531,13,1611,54606,8065,9511,67763,11,4864,296,1441,665,2035,653,4046,3532,425,409,18757,1056,26692,11,1880,4864,88817,331,2852,3625,293,533,35285,7930,5019,969,1188,36875,13327,1001,3625,1760,978,1414,45973,12155,33403,6491,38672,5919,13,4418,66,11,5019,45602,11,503,34155,11741,1339,28130,1008,10610,11,1880,4864,1239,42441,4502,409,1208,1008,10610,11,293,533,28154,268,11,3846,6636,7010,3625,27080,288,13,2998,51092,11,503,6,8629,1082,653,12896,11,18757,1056,26692,45973,6502,3869,1666,6491,38672,5919,7010,6316,712,25108,668,409,64032,376,285,11,1880,4864,42463,3625,18757,1056,26692,33403,13109,13,14465,66517,45602,5019,951,18757,1056,26692,7930,1370,951,293,533,35285,1880,951,18757,1056,26692,7930,308,41901,2700,306,6502,13,33150,1620,11,503,34155,1647,376,978,934,31109,16948,4558,346,409,18757,1056,2298,43989,369,79507,1760,19395,8047,1370,951,293,533,35285,13,4418,66,11,1208,463,331,8511,14240,2070,11,272,17771,409,46131,4502,3625,2278,21041,294,31769,72905,951,1043,288,1370,33403,6491,38672,5919,13171,409,42533,1215,1208,31807,4011,3930,1666,978,65,533,35285,13,4418,66,11,20662,87810,11,272,17771,653,51173,409,1208,6485,13109,3930,55520,13,1952,76605,69241,9779,951,61257,1370,951,27080,288,13,4366,64965,11,10071,389,513,17634,42463,1744,514,45740,2530,1826,513,35030,276,65,30872,1557,13,19421,39587,11,272
