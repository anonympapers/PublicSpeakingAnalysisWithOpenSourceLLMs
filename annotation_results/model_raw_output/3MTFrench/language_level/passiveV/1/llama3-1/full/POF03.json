While there are moments where the speaker uses active voice to emphasize certain points (e.g., \"Je ne les ai jamais mis les pieds au Marquise\"), there are also instances where passive voice is used for clarity or objectivity (e.g., \"Les neutres Ã©mons, le fit au plan de temps\").\n\n**Evaluation:** Based on my analysis, I would rate the use of passive voice in this transcription as 1. The speaker uses a balance of active and passive voice to convey information clearly and objectively, without overwhelming the listener with too much passive construction.\n\n**Response:** Option
