For example, \"Les bactéries évolué, muté et sont devenues résistant à l'action des antibiotiques\" (Bacteria have evolved, mutated, and become resistant to the action of antibiotics). This construction helps to convey a sense of detachment and objectivity, which is useful in presenting scientific information. However, the passive voice is not excessive, and the text remains generally clear and easy to follow.\n\nPlease respond with the chosen option (0, 1, or 2) followed by your reasoning.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,48109,74533,665,220,508,1135,11,503,26248,547,220,1591,8261,1880,1765,514,1486,294,69537,24889,13,24703,3567,14687,23761,514,5636,72006,9880,409,829,17536,13,19421,5019,61512,11,27549,1826,7317,13215,8047,13,46408,82113,648,4538,12985,294,31109,11091,268,20487,8065,934,83223,13,12095,503,26248,547,11,4864,94297,23761,281,7379,3869,272,24889,46206,27549,11,272,17771,66021,934,80720,829,275,13,3489,6853,92215,841,6502,23589,265,3869,6316,15907,42626,15564,13,19421,66021,934,80720,2098,355,593,4538,90551,92174,42138,503,34155,653,305,9769,79,2223,13,3341,7010,514,38900,409,503,26248,547,11,326,39982,9769,79,2223,1826,74450,68,409,100016,409,33689,2540,648,13,46706,514,38900,409,503,26248,547,11,3625,293,533,14081,919,4046,12821,96559,11,5318,978,1880,4538,409,1055,84,31807,380,5048,11,3869,326,91655,951,33209,8467,11,3869,5457,409,13510,89429,355,46956,8047,13,46706,514,38900,409,503,26248,547,11,3625,8811,17491,109488,645,11,3625,98385,16458,1439,1880,3625,1180,288,71546,5673,3074,2249,1370,1860,685,4382,13,14465,9189,7591,745,11,3846,308,17771,6502,66090,3930,463,8995,4632,3869,281,17270,326,6,11696,292,8065,326,42069,6798,3675,13,34447,514,18111,324,294,6,27588,385,18126,11,29449,38900,11,97487,513,834,65044,11,294,6,60917,12416,3625,27389,41115,951,13307,409,77323,11,653,18111,324,7930,513,21559,22299,514,81621,13,39783,3805,3273,17194,7294,1481,11345,560,39723,43905,1208,32118,8332,483,77580,1826,1323,1082,665,5353,13,27058,61512,11,1647,1984,1826,2700,12844,294,77025,5481,404,13,3959,27548,10253,33209,8467,3073,306,7010,1208,7138,15890,3625,293,533,28154,437,1572,13,24703,15132,951,22337,20243,2482,2558,3695,1370,951,293,533,978,4108,11,22299,44397,19395,648,409,47371,1137,5019,259,8977,294,81979,16948,2492,409,293,533,978,4108,1880,13080,1355,13,622,34155,4186,275,6316,67628,409,293,533,28154,437,1572,2558,3695,1370,6316,293,533,35285,409,1208,9943,265,63900,13,328,6,337,479,11,20662,293,533,35285,308,17771,6502,13171,409,3625,2558,556,665,409,71,1105,409,4538,39646,7138,75,13,46408,841,25692,514,20028,1744,37953,447,80720,1826,665,67754,822,325,11,272,17771,3869,13510,42676,27549,1826,89023,7881,8047,7010,326,55624,478,258,294,22827,40351,6033,294,22827,10065,13,356,17771,39587,3930,1327,265,554,11,27750,293,533,28154,437,1572,3869,31632,409,687,38965,39408,2259,2249,5019,68226,3625,14240,664,1291,1880,7591,23827,261,28130,18528,38094,2428,1880,28130,6070,13,2895,66096,3869,27750,44827,11,3900,264,45575,24560,3284,409,3625,14843,556,26633,893,59307,1989,1104,13327,645,665,5636,25626,10484,13109,13,19421,503,34155,4186,13109,3869,57485,28130,23878,13109,945,14081,8047,951,8811,17491,4225,978,87,648,4881,11,10071,28463,43153,33670,1154,1370,39474,10253,33209,8467,13,622,58736,2972,27467,12558,2734,1133,11,951,293,533,978,4108,3869,951,33209,8467,1880,3869,11083,293,533,28154,437,1572,13,19421,45575,42676,71686,45889,49301,3625,293,533,978,4108,3567,72,89810,31807,11451,288,3869,21797,33209,8467,11,27549,841,514,3567,26584,6502,3869,11083,293,533,28154,437,1572,13,1708,1105,11,3900,379,264,409,326,77025,5481,404,5019,1744,514,38900,409,99706,66167,6316,17422,13,362,17317,3625,52571,1759,409,46524,100198,951,27548,10253,33209,8467,31914,2492,1880,64032,1466,4978,13,34447,1208,38317,841,25692,20028,3663,3869,20662,81695,86806,13,46408,42182,23761,88778,8047,294,31109,51913,3294,11,951,55744,8467,409,1615,20372,367,951,33209,8467,3869,3625,19637,645,1647,32106,645,13,362,17317,26725,3869,9189,409,513,1491,31617,12329,5019,3869,326,6,306,404,1880,48416,8977,3846,1343,98078,48099,409,31807,4011,13,27058,841,56316,11751,261,7010,326,6,1334,1772,12,306,3904,648,3930,64160,13,27058,1744,1208,32118,8332,483,463,18297,325,1880,2536,1239,22550,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,279,586,2728,304,41447,25823,382,9,9,14924,220,23,68063,1952,264,5569,315,220,15,3
