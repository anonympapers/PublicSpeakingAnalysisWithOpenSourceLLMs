(Scale: 0-2)\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nAfter analyzing the TRANSCRIPT, I would rate the use of passive voice as follows:\n\nOption chosen: 1 (A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity)\n\nThe speaker uses some passive constructions to present information objectively and maintain a neutral tone. For example, \"On connaît tous cette étoation\" (\"Everyone knows this situation\"), \"C'est en pence à l'été où la surface t'en l'acque...\" (\"It's summer when the surface is...\"). These constructions help to create a sense of detachment and avoid taking personal responsibility for the ideas presented. However, the speaker also uses active voice in many instances, which maintains a balance between clarity and objectivity.\n\nOverall, I believe that the use of passive voice is judiciously used to achieve the desired effect, without overwhelming the text or making it unclear.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,1952,74282,77422,26725,20662,4046,998,367,13,1952,264,63669,294,22827,47838,100007,11,10071,1208,8919,648,1826,83457,13,356,17771,665,90551,783,11,389,1826,1208,34922,13,19421,3869,46777,37291,11,4864,757,36731,22011,11,39043,87264,14707,409,68226,4046,331,2431,404,1647,100007,9952,6316,2592,294,31769,64374,44093,55852,13,19421,3900,841,47090,6502,4046,331,2431,404,25945,78060,13,44564,3419,11,27549,1826,44093,523,536,11,5309,11,220,966,11,220,1272,1099,11,1880,326,6,1334,1327,57663,1685,593,44093,5636,37291,13,356,17771,20662,44178,16271,409,2798,14081,1598,13,14465,5320,2249,43678,665,4046,47262,13109,13,19421,39043,11,39043,274,53149,6853,1208,97247,12,978,2635,2265,13109,13,19421,22299,9189,23933,10333,1765,1647,2217,11,653,6900,324,1841,1647,98151,34395,11,3869,44093,653,81337,70412,1880,653,81337,282,1607,11,22299,6316,11715,11,653,81337,5636,1880,653,81337,41091,13,19421,3625,26633,72070,5512,11,46152,15132,19266,1768,5512,1370,653,86374,10599,13,19421,27750,86374,10599,11,272,17771,514,1080,12844,409,86374,3059,13,34447,409,514,9765,462,16339,11,272,17771,60019,6502,51794,13,3206,887,8047,11,272,17771,294,49963,12329,951,76307,81987,2482,5714,14014,13,19421,272,96287,45371,30870,273,912,556,1765,1647,2217,13,19421,272,17771,54008,467,13,81245,15132,46680,969,1001,1651,404,5512,1370,514,282,1607,13,12535,4864,36731,1651,404,978,1370,6316,51651,6160,12339,6816,25108,1557,42676,3900,20272,70412,13,19421,22299,951,2598,2482,274,41901,5714,14014,11,28130,54409,7986,11412,75831,6316,24408,98151,34395,13,622,34155,917,6091,3869,9765,462,16339,27750,2598,2482,9952,653,86374,10599,11,6502,23008,1880,934,54386,71451,961,412,409,326,6,61263,668,20028,6316,80444,938,38672,818,13,356,17771,934,54386,42182,72796,3625,2598,2482,7010,653,12046,579,5019,14707,3625,79835,261,13,19421,272,17771,326,31769,447,579,13,2057,72,14707,5088,268,404,1208,44178,16271,2798,14081,1598,9465,3625,26633,72070,5512,409,29449,6900,324,13,19421,39015,11,66517,39043,25945,14707,13,356,17771,665,281,768,3869,326,6,39883,39723,1208,7479,259,41901,326,6,582,593,11,27549,1826,14707,5636,13826,799,1744,514,21901,13,34447,3900,47090,28463,6316,51651,6929,344,13109,294,31769,47262,13109,13,19421,39015,11,326,93847,272,17771,6502,25945,51651,13,33150,5891,29097,11,4502,389,26514,2182,653,12069,11,326,93847,3567,1188,6929,12844,294,31769,47262,13109,66021,934,22827,12069,11,39043,687,1188,951,5714,14014,13,19421,272,17771,4839,1133,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,7684,2058,13,19421,39587,73661,275,294,49963,12329,653,12069,7930,12046,579,3869,2798,14081,1598,67513,13,19421,39043,11,39043,20272,326,22827,12046,579,28772,2428,13,356,17771,665,951,98385,30870,645,8065,43200,409,523,978,65932,1765,326,78337,13,19421,2800,306,665,62891,80259,13,11876,2598,2482,11,272,17771,52962,1133,22299,951,98385,33013,98942,13,19421,39043,69260,13,19421,8175,265,665,3729,11,3900,1826,1592,981,21901,13,1252,28800,22299,48595,978,3913,30870,4749,3869,326,6,82301,403,294,6,2244,398,13,19421,39015,11,514,6900,324,841,34501,818,5636,13,27058,51913,5615,466,39043,11,389,25692,62439,1208,7479,294,31109,61624,90486,2598,1130,13,622,34155,100162,934,54386,25692,3625,665,71650,9952,6316,4020,1557,6144,23994,18641,9952,3625,12046,579,28772,8467,13,27058,51913,2058,934,35329,1826,54008,556,665,3729,13,1252,28800,22299,39043,11,1765,1208,6685,11,8065,16993,901,4579,11,4864,36731,665,71650,1370,6316,4020,1557,1880,54613,409,326,49963,1082,757,5916,261,13,19421,3900,757,66167,35597,3869,46524,3625,79713,3698,2259,19941,409,40321,1821,5019,1744,653,9880,9189,9189,9071,34886,45669,15265,100007,9952,1208,523,61047,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,586,828,304,41447,25823,1701,279,91022,7476,7618,382,9,9,14924,220,23,68063,2650,1053,499,15806,279,1005,315,28979,7899,304,420,46940,30,320,7092,25,220,15,12,17,696,9,9,3883,68063,198,198,9,
