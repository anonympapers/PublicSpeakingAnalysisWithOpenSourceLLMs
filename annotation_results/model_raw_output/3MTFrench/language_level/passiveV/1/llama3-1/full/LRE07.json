{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T20:03:07.165450803Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcription of public speech given in TRANSCRIPT.\n\n**Question 8:** On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A little bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Analysis:** Upon reviewing the TRANSCRIPT, I notice that the speaker uses a mix of active and passive voice. While there are some instances of clear passive voice (e.g., \"Les scientifiques utilisent donc la meteorologie pour prévoir la production d'énergie solaire\"), there are also many instances where the speaker could have used active voice instead.\n\nFor example, in sentences like \"Il y a à ma m'échardbon et ma m'igase\" or \"Il voudra surtout, et aussi une trice de conscience\", the speaker uses passive voice to describe actions that could be attributed to specific individuals (e.g., \"Ma petite surlie\" or \"Lesquins n'outils\"). While this use of passive voice does not necessarily render the text unclear, it can make the text seem less engaging and less personal.\n\nHowever, I do not think that the speaker uses excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear. The text is generally coherent and easy to follow, with some exceptions where the speaker's thoughts are fragmented or meandering (e.g., in the sections where they describe their own personal experiences).\n\n**Response:** Option chosen: 1\n\nIn my opinion, the use of passive voice in this transcription is mostly for clarity/objectivity, but not excessively so. The speaker uses a mix of active and passive voice to achieve a balance between clarity and personal engagement.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,3869,1208,9517,16588,5019,7643,270,4558,325,11,10071,4864,91507,9189,89504,409,7643,38920,274,1103,648,11,7930,436,5615,588,409,409,43406,3273,66522,1880,7930,296,53149,301,1339,6348,708,404,13,622,6,437,301,467,11,87320,9964,259,77025,68082,11,4864,841,60946,82,6502,3846,7930,259,6,391,652,285,13,27058,61512,11,389,379,43989,77818,2249,11,8941,4371,12267,43989,46680,265,2249,11,5019,9604,265,1647,34922,513,4160,556,11,41091,11,4538,311,275,11,503,34155,1069,324,3930,56662,13,19421,97507,11,39043,296,26248,15925,15925,13,622,34155,9517,621,1072,11,9964,44496,73173,11828,11,503,34155,58673,484,978,653,459,68082,5019,3625,2960,969,951,4046,47262,437,6962,11,10071,39043,296,26248,1558,13109,409,1208,272,17771,13,14465,757,36731,22011,11,87320,841,6502,296,6,43114,404,7010,326,49152,306,554,409,326,31769,64374,2092,12267,3869,1208,9517,16588,13,622,34155,59148,1653,1744,3625,2960,969,326,31769,772,34395,2092,12267,11,1208,5788,951,2960,969,326,31769,772,34395,2092,12267,308,17771,6502,56586,481,13,46408,7591,3825,409,326,41901,1575,321,1001,13,11876,7330,333,8467,42587,306,39587,1208,42142,38469,5019,27389,35573,1208,5788,294,31769,64374,2092,12267,13,34447,503,6,437,301,467,514,27138,934,54386,9604,11,1826,54312,27138,3062,949,507,2005,11,3900,296,6,74972,1744,46777,2592,294,31769,64374,1826,6316,409,51309,33820,285,11,3869,7930,9964,7631,288,46777,46415,409,326,6,77217,409,3273,1557,13,7695,379,264,3869,7643,296,31769,331,569,6098,1880,7643,296,6,343,521,13,34447,84568,15132,25945,17536,31355,1880,1081,268,3209,519,3869,75802,653,28800,60014,100063,13,7695,379,264,3869,7643,296,52152,84,1206,12267,11,10071,9964,439,44093,1069,324,1744,326,6,77217,79071,21559,259,6,4683,2353,1339,1208,7216,13,19421,3900,379,264,7643,296,6,61023,1339,13,356,17771,3869,27389,69,52424,11,1880,3625,11884,309,285,7930,46680,969,1188,84440,13,34447,28463,653,28800,8811,5979,355,1841,27549,841,21559,56316,11,3846,1744,9964,25400,439,7631,978,13,24971,25945,95234,5019,2942,12329,6316,84143,8628,978,1764,9465,6293,483,1880,14707,41091,11,4864,36731,514,46110,16948,290,7930,11412,2477,4958,404,27584,1765,326,6,52009,1880,16968,13510,9964,3567,41098,7631,261,653,82113,42625,3869,7643,296,31769,331,569,6098,5019,259,6,300,3460,72,8628,978,1764,13,14465,36731,39587,48901,77807,37093,11,3625,96642,75601,2601,409,27389,13311,7010,3846,326,6,607,1001,13,356,17771,21965,23008,11,4864,296,6,329,370,414,1677,648,11,1880,46206,6316,25945,70311,18694,11,1841,39015,11,7930,11,9952,4538,52827,11,326,68070,321,9339,11,342,10515,1339,16968,42138,1474,12558,11,514,13612,321,1826,38605,84,425,2961,1553,3869,326,6,20100,17403,13,34447,1841,326,6,52009,11,326,68070,321,9339,308,96287,60019,6502,282,2205,13,8242,16968,11,503,35329,9339,11,3869,5457,409,5155,261,514,13612,321,294,6,295,897,2428,11,1913,72,1370,513,550,8646,3625,20043,2249,1880,1841,39015,11,1437,16080,13,622,34155,917,43711,5979,301,53052,220,15,409,1208,27389,13311,13,2009,53052,220,16,1826,97262,84,42676,951,75601,2601,51307,8467,11,389,52603,409,71751,6316,27389,13311,32592,1208,57128,294,22827,13026,13,4366,51173,11,514,46110,16948,290,1028,22011,1744,27584,3900,513,326,6,52009,11,259,26248,1814,64,294,22827,40142,220,605,33588,13,356,17771,46939,653,18629,1880,1208,4647,71933,92020,3930,46110,16948,290,44829,593,409,105706,7420,3869,653,91370,978,8065,62891,4545,3869,3460,72,8628,978,1764,13,356,17771,5019,20662,73173,1744,4864,42775,273,1765,514,53052,220,17,13,41621,326,6,52659,917,43711,13311,1880,71751,32592,57128,85193,17194,13,4366,51173,11,27584,3900,513,326,6,52009,3869,6316,6140,1765,220,17,409,311,451,308,17771,220,20,33588,1880,6316,6140,1765,220,17,409,311,451,308,17771,220,605,33588,13,19421,9964,308,6,300,5636,934,6,60917,12416,46131,6316,4197,13109,5019,95917,359,951,1156,10610,10308,13,11583,38920,326,6,25108,273,2922,6496,9952,514,38847,13,46408,296
