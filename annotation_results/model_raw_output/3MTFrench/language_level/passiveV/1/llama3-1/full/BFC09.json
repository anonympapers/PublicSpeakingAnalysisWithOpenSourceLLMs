The transcription uses a mix of active and passive voice, with some sentences using passive construction to convey objectivity and clarity. For example, \"Il est donc inconcevable, le tester l'ensemble des candidats potentiels.\" (It is therefore unimaginable, testing all potential candidates). While there are some instances of excessive use of passive voice, overall the text remains clear and understandable.\n\n**Answer:** Option chosen:
