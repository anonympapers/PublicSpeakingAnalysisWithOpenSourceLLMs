For example, \"On sait que aura compter une compréhension critique qui favorise la légite scolaire.\" (It is known that counting comprehension fosters school literacy.) This usage of the passive voice helps to convey the speaker's thoughts and ideas in a clear and concise manner.\n\nPlease note that I only chose one option based on my analysis of the transcription.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,21847,6316,48659,87810,56445,13,7695,264,24560,6316,37291,6316,7643,77422,22550,7930,513,3488,77,1339,1765,1208,281,6960,274,1154,951,33013,4558,2396,1880,1208,18488,951,68061,625,1821,13,5186,12416,220,868,8261,7010,6316,37417,11,27549,513,5869,1557,1765,653,70927,7930,25400,259,1188,3869,272,89412,514,82620,3930,8859,425,13,2998,67781,11,26725,3625,60404,308,6,546,6502,3869,326,31769,56745,9952,514,27584,24757,74775,1880,3625,123299,9004,75332,2436,665,13550,978,71,2711,3930,8859,425,13,19421,3846,7930,1826,5636,665,39381,11,272,17771,934,54386,1913,1339,42676,514,13088,978,5571,11,272,17771,51199,4538,44093,30179,6960,8065,7591,376,3904,951,33013,4558,2396,409,64972,2477,74775,13,356,17771,1208,55162,751,668,40351,11,4864,7591,65,36427,13,12029,67882,11,3625,60404,308,6,546,6502,16968,3846,27584,1046,12416,3869,1208,7829,4046,911,635,13,3402,60544,3869,15265,87810,27389,69,68862,11,73103,934,54386,9189,264,25774,1880,1375,361,22299,9189,14240,74466,46110,11,1880,14707,26725,3625,60404,308,6,546,6502,15925,15265,6140,13,65381,56321,8261,11,76076,60404,46939,84233,69,5499,409,5636,409,296,4618,76145,409,326,31769,302,324,13109,11,45575,1744,294,81979,665,264,25774,87011,11,10071,1744,21901,3625,6699,514,57992,33670,272,24889,28130,33632,519,13,1611,2249,4046,49974,11,3625,1400,8637,43429,841,8657,1188,6502,5019,342,316,1195,27750,44178,63934,288,11,10071,1744,21901,3625,68061,625,1821,11,1208,86323,9952,26317,60404,11,1647,42775,274,6,1354,38096,7010,6316,3057,1557,21901,8047,1765,3625,46681,2047,15844,11,3625,25400,1773,812,12908,1880,3930,2211,953,13,5034,95234,3122,8047,1765,3625,46681,2773,306,306,308,17771,6502,409,348,2053,1880,9189,665,47592,69379,84,89504,13,5034,2322,668,4502,17317,69152,41199,220,1272,8261,11,3625,32118,8332,1354,33670,10045,306,653,89714,11,3900,513,3122,1765,951,46681,282,2205,5019,1062,1814,4538,5107,13109,11,1880,14707,272,17771,20662,98652,1744,503,34155,274,31769,85,680,76366,665,8198,409,326,31769,34985,13,622,34155,94031,653,704,321,13713,402,685,9952,326,31769,566,13109,36252,347,1640,2428,11,43453,506,7404,519,13,3489,438,4864,1370,273,294,6,412,8839,11,841,6502,6316,1206,978,56404,4105,6033,653,7364,818,2749,325,13,356,17771,653,8641,281,15433,55180,2428,7930,3327,2428,4068,58673,15610,11,1208,13550,978,71,2711,1880,326,6,1036,7769,3869,31632,294,6,21687,409,326,31769,69769,1598,409,9500,288,13,1952,829,275,1744,40142,55056,261,6316,13550,978,71,2711,43665,7930,4799,1082,1208,73083,635,1156,8083,556,13,356,17771,5019,45602,1744,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,5320,2249,4046,838,8977,3625,3369,1441,409,3846,8641,1765,3625,46430,1056,1154,1880,3625,33013,4558,2396,13,24703,8641,1826,6316,31914,580,11,1826,54312,934,35329,29557,294,58591,73511,15171,1208,13550,978,71,2711,1880,4502,97507,11,1765,26077,13189,1826,5019,934,6,37907,33013,4558,2396,13,1221,846,79507,11,4864,1421,81,1088,89,220,5154,8261,665,1879,519,11,665,1879,519,11,665,7591,1072,447,367,4972,60224,13,24703,7930,71925,6960,11,220,21,931,220,2636,33013,4558,2396,409,220,18,11,220,19,1880,220,20,8261,13,19421,503,34155,33537,978,326,6,31258,10253,7120,1880,6502,10253,46106,13,622,34155,4046,26591,978,220,2636,33013,4558,2396,11,7970,8065,24181,6502,43905,86806,11,33670,1879,1133,1880,42138,665,1879,1133,13,19421,45602,917,9484,7010,220,18,8261,13,19421,74699,11,4864,66517,951,29060,20719,8467,5019,77885,3471,3625,5208,14014,951,33013,4558,2396,1880,7216,89,45325,1744,3625,100246,15132,25945,665,25775,13,11876,33013,4558,2396,7930,14848,84233,69,3457,978,409,3846,8641,11,1391,1466,77,306,64972,1744,3846,7930,14848,84233,69,3457,978,7010,514,1879,1133,14464,4088,13,1708,1105,11,4864,9189,1208,1867,451,11,326,6,1138,412,978,1317,361,1880,326,6,768,1001,409,12155,10034,46481,8839,11,10071,503,34155,43306,978,1208,9314,531,978,951,6699,11,37953,447,85217,15473,1834,3869,1208,36252,22550,934,85217,28130
