For example, \"C'est un terrain du compte qui était plus facile de déplacer des objets lourds...\" or \"Il faudra ensuite attendre le 15e siècle pour que les honnards devacissent découvrent le principe du roulement...\". The use of passive voice does not overwhelm the text and is mainly used to provide context and
