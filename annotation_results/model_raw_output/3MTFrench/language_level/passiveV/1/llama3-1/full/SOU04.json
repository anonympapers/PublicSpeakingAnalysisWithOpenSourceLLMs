{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T19:04:56.085112127Z","response":"**Task:** Analyze the transcript using the questionnaire.\n\n**Question 8:** How would you evaluate the use of passive voice in this discourse?\n\n**Options:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**Answer:** Option chosen: 1; (A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity)\n\nJustification:\n\nThe transcript does contain some instances of passive voice, but they are not excessive. The author uses passive voice to provide objectivity and clarify certain concepts, such as when describing how metals behave under different temperatures or explaining the properties of mercury particles. While there is a slight overuse of passive voice in places, it is generally used effectively to enhance comprehension and maintain a neutral tone.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,296,6,351,258,1339,9189,11,326,6,1036,84,648,8065,4499,519,409,15265,81645,13,2998,89175,11,9189,308,6,90276,6502,25945,436,395,324,978,1880,9189,47592,14707,73173,13,2998,67781,11,3869,5353,409,1208,60014,85,4105,2145,40948,978,11,653,11677,1880,83457,69003,978,13,27058,12155,91878,11,3900,2267,664,14687,934,54386,1826,7010,12155,4160,42204,11,3625,6730,978,13075,7930,4160,1188,1208,85434,13,34447,4068,39043,15572,261,1339,949,9589,54312,1744,9189,47592,46939,84228,64591,1744,42676,389,74817,68,25945,12108,653,36252,278,11,3846,62891,1826,296,26248,579,1208,41263,20712,85059,949,19421,42676,389,74817,68,35597,5636,12108,11,3900,1826,296,26248,579,1208,41263,20712,1529,29097,13,34447,42676,389,74817,68,6502,45575,11,1880,3399,11,3900,1826,296,26248,579,44093,409,1208,41263,20712,11,829,1739,6502,409,841,6502,1208,46131,9952,12155,20043,2249,13,356,17771,409,1208,41263,20712,25654,277,85059,13,7695,308,59858,264,6502,1744,3625,32118,2629,2249,11,26725,3625,2909,1441,11,3625,4039,12249,1880,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,665,9395,99746,13,19421,951,6730,978,13075,25654,277,85059,15132,2107,4893,409,1208,85877,440,261,409,9880,22299,409,85434,13,1708,1105,11,1370,26077,1826,6730,978,13075,25654,277,85059,11,39043,29253,46939,13,19421,5019,61512,11,389,841,38831,83384,6502,7010,12155,4160,42204,13,27058,62998,949,19421,14707,66021,934,6,37907,15132,21965,23008,13,19421,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,409,52895,716,6316,48659,2869,38469,5019,68226,98004,805,514,38847,13,27058,45602,11,503,34155,63669,294,22827,5634,28154,2933,7930,11412,77680,3125,56321,4742,31539,13,356,2604,653,1826,2098,582,275,1208,9765,34395,13,356,2604,26633,15938,655,3625,25654,277,85059,14707,97717,13,19421,4742,31539,56321,11,3900,2267,664,14687,934,35329,5625,15760,20662,44225,951,25654,277,85059,665,79071,14896,409,51794,3869,84921,261,13,1252,2126,519,98151,34395,1370,51173,13,56744,72,3625,436,5518,5803,1900,11,389,71451,3625,54008,4918,409,43116,81492,16888,1439,13,62463,54008,4918,513,43998,10515,79738,51794,479,1880,665,5636,11,84568,15132,7397,6929,25423,13,356,17771,3869,13510,1744,1208,41263,20712,934,6,37907,3731,69625,25692,23761,5625,275,665,2126,519,98151,34395,13,12535,7363,818,10253,2092,17724,949,2998,5636,11,84568,3731,69625,3625,25654,277,85059,11,10071,39043,11,272,17771,3869,6316,3044,934,54386,3625,9765,34395,409,1208,51651,62827,13,2998,67781,11,27750,54008,4918,14848,951,21744,10515,5512,653,28800,2598,24520,31539,934,54386,917,6853,3625,21744,10515,5512,10484,8467,13,2009,955,409,41263,20712,934,6,37907,3731,69625,7591,3825,306,409,28130,62827,13,19421,39043,11,272,17771,6316,21744,39883,934,54386,38831,83384,6502,7010,1208,17536,409,26725,3625,49301,13,4366,51173,11,9189,326,6,52659,6316,8590,1082,12704,361,1880,27549,9517,376,20243,648,8065,30583,425,13,19421,14707,4502,27549,50590,3625,123299,9004,21744,10515,5512,7930,296,17771,54008,16869,2428,11,665,2349,519,62827,11,27549,44521,1339,2609,978,409,76651,13,27058,11083,54008,4918,11,3900,47090,39587,1744,4864,3625,43998,10515,1082,409,1208,62827,7930,15938,1395,3625,25654,277,85059,11,272,17771,3869,13510,18003,12416,11,45441,220,1041,220,931,37291,5636,1913,934,22827,3091,588,2249,13,34447,3900,757,66167,653,62891,80259,13,356,17771,22299,653,44229,295,3869,6667,261,653,2126,519,98151,34395,1765,653,31260,28463,46110,13,356,17771,12266,13,7695,757,47090,79071,14896,409,5636,25500,13,356,17771,87320,11,4864,7591,2972,11083,54008,4918,32592,1208,57128,294,22827,4632,1880,4864,1437,29097,3625,11741,978,1800,5512,3869,653,97262,321,7930,84921,514,2126,519,98151,34395,13,7695,757,66167,45575,3869,7643,1765,8047,1744,4502,326,6,28400,404,25654,277,85059,1826,35406,978,8065,83259,3930,4632,11,514,2126,519,98151,34395,934,80720,78422,14081,2473,2961,1553,64,3869,829,29051,294,31109,2598,5724,326,49455,265,11,48041,71933,326,6,39749,978,1800,978,3930
