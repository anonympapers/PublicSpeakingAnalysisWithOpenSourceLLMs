For example:\n\n* \"Ce sont les nerfs dans la pôde mépier, qui a envoyé le message de la douleur jusqu'à mon cerveau.\"\n* \"Leur nerfs sont un peu décripits.\"\n\nThis use of passive voice helps to clarify complex biological processes and maintain a neutral tone. However, the text is not overly reliant on passive voice constructions, which suggests that the author is using it judiciously for clarity purposes rather than excessively.\n\n**Response:** Option
