The author uses passive constructions to describe scientific concepts, such as \"l'ivermektine fonctionne sur ce paradis\" (Livermektine functions on this worm) and \"les récepteurs sont composés de cinq sous-unités\" (Receptors are composed of five subunits). These constructions serve to clarify complex ideas and maintain objectivity. However, the passive voice is not excessive, as the author still uses active voice in many places to convey personal opinions and experiences.\n\n**Choice:** Option 1: Some passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n\n**Response:**
