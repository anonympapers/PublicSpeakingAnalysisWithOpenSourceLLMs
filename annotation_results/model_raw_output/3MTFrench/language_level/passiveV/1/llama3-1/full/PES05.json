The speaker uses phrases such as \"Nous sommes déjà passé des sentiers\" (We've already gone through the paths) and \"Les R-5G seront intelligentes et même dépollantes\" (The R-5G will be intelligent and even de-polluting), which contribute to a sense of detachment and lack of personal involvement. However, the overall tone is not overly passive, and the speaker still maintains control over the narrative.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:** [Insert transcript text
