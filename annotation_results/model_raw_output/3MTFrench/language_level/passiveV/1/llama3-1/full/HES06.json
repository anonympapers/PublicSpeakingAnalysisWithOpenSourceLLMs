For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, 2 with explanations on what these options represent in the SUB-SECTION OPTIONS. You should only choose one of these options and provide your answer in the format: Option chosen: 0, 1 or 2; Respond to questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**QUESTIONNAIRE:**\n\nQuestion 8. On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcription's discourse?\n\n**OPTIONS:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\n\n(The entire transcript is provided above)\n\nTo answer this question, I will evaluate the use of the passive voice in the transcription's discourse. Based on my analysis, I choose:\n\n**Option chosen:** 1\n\nI believe the transcription uses a bit of passive voice to provide clarity and objectivity. The speaker mentions \"Frédéric a été charge d'acheter\" (Frédéric was in charge of buying) and \"les commercières et c'était désir avec le S avé\" (the saleswomen were happy with the software), which are examples of using passive voice to provide background information or emphasize certain actions. The excessive use of passive voice is not a major issue, as it does not significantly affect the text's clarity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,514,60697,409,4242,4558,325,11,4864,296,48099,951,97263,8065,2394,15433,9011,1557,66106,324,1880,409,77932,3869,46777,13,7695,379,264,48488,294,22827,409,27750,97263,11,503,34155,66283,978,2939,15433,39965,653,34361,7870,324,1880,3900,296,26248,15473,778,978,3846,934,35329,25400,1826,69003,978,13,5034,47403,3930,1515,78493,51307,2428,13,2939,15433,39965,264,24560,6900,294,6,613,1430,514,43453,1515,78493,5019,514,2532,8518,13,1252,81994,74608,25400,10045,978,220,1490,220,931,33588,11,653,47838,81994,74608,25400,10045,978,220,1041,220,931,33588,11,42138,8216,4046,70,1604,2939,15433,39965,264,2665,13532,66090,7930,25400,10045,1339,220,1490,220,931,33588,11,46152,23423,64,1188,20028,6316,51651,3611,12267,13,34447,3846,1744,2939,15433,39965,308,49152,1339,6502,25945,48234,13,356,17771,1208,6485,13109,3930,1515,78493,7930,1536,53890,3625,95194,59307,1880,272,96287,46838,404,9952,514,328,1860,978,13,24703,15132,3625,26633,348,552,7930,841,274,98279,652,3904,6502,1880,7930,3381,31632,3625,8403,3869,1208,3613,21201,13,356,17771,1208,281,14140,409,84064,265,294,82405,17724,7930,78422,4558,8135,3930,8631,951,802,978,14991,2836,1880,20263,9483,13559,2939,15433,39965,308,49152,1339,6502,27389,46790,39043,13,4366,346,1744,39043,3846,308,17771,6502,27389,46790,7010,3625,1515,3457,2053,1880,3625,704,8839,951,34361,1900,1880,665,5636,272,17771,25945,77411,3869,523,333,1658,261,13,1708,1105,4068,62439,3625,79165,30,19421,14707,272,17771,39043,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,14465,19477,9425,653,83597,13171,294,6,16288,3625,4020,1725,2145,21041,1880,3625,4020,1725,61387,5512,1880,4864,19477,9425,3846,83597,7010,6316,93486,8065,19910,409,2532,3869,39043,13,62293,6316,75601,347,38469,409,38317,11,21623,11,1652,1631,978,376,2428,665,5634,10188,8047,1765,514,83597,41589,77249,68866,978,1370,3625,2848,24201,1759,11,829,29456,11,264,569,14014,11,2107,19010,10515,552,1880,3625,46106,52571,1759,409,326,6,69068,269,13,14465,9189,3327,2428,13,622,6,2295,299,713,951,34361,7870,1759,951,4294,4893,3869,39043,951,42587,36306,13,14465,28130,62163,1880,4864,6667,68,951,44827,5965,275,5983,11,10484,275,5983,41645,59307,13,622,6,44803,325,9952,41091,1208,36679,81,16091,76420,11,514,78551,39043,5019,19477,52750,1647,83597,13,4656,13559,3869,20662,3869,3846,83597,13,356,17771,93486,9721,5048,11412,834,20672,3930,21134,704,321,13171,294,6,16288,3625,25949,1765,3625,4020,48303,38448,409,42775,1880,1765,326,6,58904,1765,514,42775,13,19421,4864,9189,296,1441,514,78060,7010,1208,1913,404,13,14465,100164,653,83597,41589,77249,4382,1218,20995,11,40744,3625,97263,15890,26725,3625,3600,3869,39043,11,951,2606,4918,409,91653,294,31769,676,11,2107,4893,294,6,16288,11,121372,533,288,3869,39043,11,326,6,58400,1765,3625,4787,409,42775,1880,1765,326,6,58904,13,19421,39043,11,9189,26483,19610,6502,1744,39043,11412,62439,3625,4787,409,17536,8065,42775,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,27671,4096,68063,198,198,6396,25,38527,3059,279,46940,315,586,828,304,41447,25823,627,198,1271,656,420,6492,11,5296,1523,279,41447,25823,4184,311,279,4860,315,279,91022,7476,7618,13,1789,1855,3488,11,499,617,2380,2671,25,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,449,41941,389,1148,1521,2671,4097,304,279,16532,12,59878,52380,13,1472,1288,1193,5268,832,315,1521,2671,323,3493,701,4320,304,279,3645,25,7104,12146,25,220,15,11,220,16,477,220,17,26,40633,311,4860,304,279,2015,814,5101,304,279,91022,7476,7618,382,9,9,53528,7476,7618,68063,198,198,14924,220,23,13,1952,264,5569,315,220,15,311,220,17,11,1268,656,499,15806,279,1005,315,279,28979,7899,304,420,46940,596,41602,1980,9,9,58029,68063,198,198,9,220,15,284,2360,28979,7899,13,198,9,220,16,284,362,2766,315,28979,7899,369,32373,60589,1968,13,198,9,220,17,284,1398,87728,28979,7899,430,3727,279,1495,25420,382,9,9,49873,25823,68063,198,198,7,791,4553,36815,374,3984,3485,340,198,1271,4320,420,3488,11,358,690,15806,279,1005,315,
