However, these instances are not excessive and do not obscure the text's clarity.\n\n**Option chosen:** 1 - A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,350,519,519,519,758,11583,41798,757,5945,588,13,21652,8065,7591,969,3904,294,22827,5542,11,514,99988,292,1826,958,442,5701,13,41621,379,8666,10333,3625,2007,12249,294,82405,73265,5019,46932,265,3625,52314,3930,99988,292,13,11876,13307,665,26633,4046,1543,978,409,52314,15132,3869,15265,46096,5019,16968,68061,625,1133,13,423,6,60917,12416,11083,44827,11,3900,274,6,74972,294,22827,98947,409,95159,1439,7930,1826,917,31244,3869,1208,7479,951,43700,1880,264,77635,3869,28130,89869,13,27058,64972,60946,265,3846,1343,98078,48099,11,3900,47090,513,628,647,261,8065,272,89412,951,43700,13,65381,326,55624,57663,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,3625,1651,7085,15132,25945,14707,21874,5512,1880,1376,288,653,40126,2092,579,13,34447,8065,18742,1880,3869,84921,3930,21765,951,28788,11,46152,82133,513,46838,8629,12329,55398,81991,4846,6316,10353,25945,45350,3869,28800,3625,35530,1529,29097,13,356,17771,51625,285,42625,20662,10474,7930,274,17771,95159,324,978,1880,3869,76069,556,8065,7591,969,3904,3930,5542,13,5034,6425,1180,31037,5019,31807,3023,265,3846,80259,6824,68,3869,31674,26464,1208,7479,951,43700,13,34447,45602,1080,30872,668,23008,11,10071,5019,41091,23008,11,9189,45366,665,11573,266,294,6,42792,12844,519,13,6178,72,11,11083,6954,59307,24654,665,5210,11,296,26248,14175,285,294,6,16288,3625,56321,82512,11384,409,3846,1343,98078,48099,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,2798,14081,1598,11,5019,46131,27750,23464,14014,55398,81991,220,3101,409,911,5512,13,2998,51092,11,1208,3577,290,7584,8047,1370,514,97418,3930,5542,409,220,3443,52021,5019,1651,978,1414,3625,23464,14014,1880,514,3541,332,1133,13,2009,1665,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,7591,6323,69328,3869,83597,7033,978,8637,2428,11,29557,61512,409,550,15433,556,7010,74940,3044,11412,513,4846,1208,10474,1529,29097,13,2998,34501,3930,955,409,5542,11,1880,951,4787,3930,99988,292,13,5034,274,15433,14081,266,11,3900,841,513,1491,333,9008,6502,409,1208,27584,76407,9465,1208,326,46429,1880,503,34155,348,8047,68082,88793,11,7930,841,4160,275,6502,27750,220,1272,4046,70,5512,1370,9880,1880,1208,326,46429,1880,5309,9465,824,65301,665,17033,27750,506,2922,978,708,285,9952,71686,653,76680,269,1370,9880,13,2895,66096,3869,1647,83597,11,4864,36731,13171,409,550,15433,556,3846,1744,11412,1207,404,514,13881,42138,46777,21765,409,5542,13,34447,11,55133,65285,266,11,296,26248,14175,285,294,6,16288,3625,82512,26467,3869,10025,593,409,18488,409,10474,1529,29097,13,27058,1062,1814,5636,51625,285,42625,1647,83597,11,951,4043,2852,665,9511,67763,15132,27389,85,355,13,452,6,352,519,13080,259,31769,1414,294,59858,46131,20028,379,3869,46096,11,47090,409,719,1414,3869,43453,11,326,27688,8047,1880,409,14843,556,514,21765,294,22827,10415,11067,13,507,2005,11,4864,28068,68,8065,46110,5542,11,10071,3846,308,17771,6502,4839,1133,653,46110,5542,11,10071,96308,653,13881,259,3514,519,1765,514,43014,6316,38920,29465,87,409,220,21,10166,409,13047,99746,11412,7364,1215,13,2895,66096,3869,1647,13726,10398,467,11,4864,1446,2192,13171,409,14843,556,85114,4595,409,5542,1880,409,14843,556,326,31769,447,12031,409,51854,65838,409,21765,409,5542,13,69327,39015,11,1208,220,1544,513,95959,11,3900,1826,27138,294,6,14283,9517,67,7420,1647,39474,5019,51913,2058,409,43453,77072,13,350,41901,37622,11,37622,758,84276,11,1647,82,62005,11,514,99988,292,312,59976,5208,91640,54606,3869,1208,7617,1604,27389,46790,7010,653,459,1880,93128,42138,17009,3930,39474,951,11909,13,44564,656,302,12844,519,264,14707,44314,978,3625,220,20,12,508,2132,288,11,16888,72,409,15265,6666,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,6396,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,2728,304,41447,25823,4184,311,279,4860,315,91022,7476,7618,382,9,9,14924,220,23,68063,1952,264,5569,315,220,15,311,220,17,11,1268,1053,499,15806,279,1005,315,279,28979,7899,304,279,41602,315,420,46940,1980,9,9,3883,68063,198,198,9,220,15,284,2360,28979,7899,13,198,9,220,16,28
