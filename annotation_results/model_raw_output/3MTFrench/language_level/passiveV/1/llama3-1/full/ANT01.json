For instance, \"Je me lance\" (I take the leap) and \"Il va falloir changer notre angle de vision\" (It will be necessary to change our perspective). However, these instances are not excessive and do not obscure the meaning of the text.\n\n**Response:** Option chosen: 1; The transcript uses some passive voice for clarity and objectivity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,514,3839,11,4864,8631,11,503,34155,1069,324,409,26317,24886,11,503,34155,1069,324,409,8811,20028,11,503,34155,1069,324,409,70375,11,503,34155,1069,324,294,49152,13603,653,26483,409,32118,97495,13,41621,47592,46939,348,20243,84,39043,949,14465,41958,1744,272,17771,46939,69003,978,3869,16968,514,38900,7010,20662,71632,13,62408,459,11927,39883,11,3846,893,593,409,2389,5397,665,779,72,1370,1069,324,409,326,31769,331,762,11,1370,1069,324,3930,5363,951,46106,13,46706,3846,4865,409,67239,978,11,45441,3869,4864,757,86345,11,45441,3869,4864,757,71451,6316,28391,13,4702,1133,11,3625,55586,1744,326,54386,513,52571,11,33670,6316,4046,1762,57123,6033,6316,4046,24756,11,389,3625,917,6853,951,44397,19395,552,294,6,28172,438,98450,13,1952,22011,1744,326,6,28172,438,98450,52962,1133,278,11,7930,6824,68,3869,513,75831,9517,301,1001,951,3703,462,31539,3869,4538,46430,1056,425,11,409,326,6,28172,438,98450,7591,13115,1339,11,7930,25400,3116,7907,3625,55586,1062,4893,665,4865,294,31769,331,762,13,12095,503,34155,70412,11,503,34155,1647,3920,852,11,4502,4864,84788,285,11,503,34155,84788,72,8811,90966,3625,5107,5512,82113,42625,17724,7010,3625,26633,4865,4864,36731,342,3326,519,13,2394,20243,1082,89,1474,6870,326,22827,951,1665,22589,409,7643,270,4558,325,1880,294,6,44803,805,326,100017,951,44397,19395,552,294,6,28172,438,98450,3869,326,31769,56745,11,9952,6316,2960,8511,409,4631,19395,14014,3869,4046,416,978,1354,409,75249,326,6,283,375,11,4864,91507,8678,805,27750,46681,11,3625,3313,9976,292,2070,1759,11,665,20272,11,1880,3625,47104,7930,14848,24560,3608,13215,5512,3869,30517,951,4860,69663,1880,951,7177,8841,1640,8467,6033,4571,8467,13,39783,37291,1744,503,34155,951,3608,13215,5512,11,4864,91507,68226,10045,261,951,10105,54401,409,3625,5844,18926,1215,8065,64972,7010,28130,934,37093,409,84788,635,13,35211,288,100246,409,7643,38317,14848,665,490,292,593,326,100017,951,44397,19395,552,294,6,28172,438,98450,1880,3127,978,7853,324,13,39783,37291,1744,503,34155,1647,3920,852,11,4864,36731,7591,18153,978,409,3738,288,917,43711,71,2711,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4864,594,82,729,40970,409,3577,290,2145,12,6496,82489,409,1208,259,9011,1557,3869,13390,404,13,14465,94297,39587,757,326,11967,11,1841,665,4865,951,3091,14295,503,34155,40970,294,6,3380,4881,16968,409,550,37093,13,24703,42844,6666,11,3900,1826,16968,409,27584,58612,486,2249,409,274,41901,809,1195,7010,951,55586,11,1841,3869,98020,11,45602,841,17317,8654,5615,1557,294,6,63734,71933,29449,46089,36875,13327,13,393,1466,2439,326,58736,45534,294,22827,33013,79351,11,1841,46152,11412,4538,21134,45369,409,308,6,1617,367,11,7930,264,1208,27389,7611,409,326,93847,11,3900,841,829,275,6502,25945,14707,29005,70,978,13,12623,46138,67239,5512,11,45441,46152,841,3355,89810,6502,3930,16968,11,45441,46152,3355,89810,11,10071,46152,326,6,283,2067,648,409,85722,9517,3311,68,1765,7643,270,4558,325,13,356,17771,653,86374,22811,11,6033,45575,46152,3355,89810,11,1880,513,71451,6316,28391,1765,2035,3869,1208,68468,483,13,18098,263,11,46152,513,503,7211,306,3869,326,93847,1880,46152,46430,82,9952,514,86374,22811,1880,3625,1615,625,288,63846,17724,13,356,17771,5019,12573,261,1744,8065,33614,294,31109,259,9011,1557,1744,326,54386,28068,68,12266,6033,21965,77411,11,3900,25692,665,20272,274,6,351,404,294,31109,272,3433,685,4017,5048,1880,389,11412,45347,3869,81337,409,29449,83187,51913,3294,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,6,370,69625,514,83259,1156,8083,556,11,10071,3846,955,409,9517,1335,11,39043,8679,64,16968,514,38900,7010,29449,259,1188,294,41901,387,12249,11,7010,653,7151,258,6033,27584,7010,514,83259,85505,13,435,13559,3869,6316,259,9011,1557,1744,4864,841,2322,376,1082,6502,11,326,6,1735,333,11412,23761,409,7591,67,2453,3689,261,3625,665,3841,2249,5019,841,6502,594,25526,404,514,63669,409,1760,978,1414,4538,1826,547,409,779,72,13,7695,11412,26564,385,404,62439,29449,9392,409,1137
