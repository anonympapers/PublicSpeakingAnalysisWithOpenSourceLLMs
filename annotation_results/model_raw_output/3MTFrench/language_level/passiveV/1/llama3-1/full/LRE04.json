{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-05-02T20:04:01.377957562Z","response":"**Analysis of the transcription**\n\n**Question 8:** On a scale of 0 to 2, how would you evaluate the use of the passive voice in this transcript?\n\n**Option chosen:** 1\n\n**Explanation:** The transcript uses some instances of the passive voice, but they are not excessive and do not render the text unclear. For example, sentences such as \"Un bébé sur six, n'attend pas l'âge d'un an\" or \"Il paraît que Rome ne s'est pas fait en un jour\" use the passive voice to convey information in a more objective tone. The overall tone of the transcript is narrative and reflective, with the author sharing their personal experiences and insights, which makes the occasional use of the passive voice suitable and effective.\n\n**Rationale:** While there are some instances of the passive voice, they do not dominate the text or make it difficult to follow. The author's use of first-person pronouns and personal anecdotes also helps to maintain a clear and engaging tone. Overall, the passive voice is used judiciously to provide clarity and objectivity in certain passages.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,3900,379,264,66056,7930,27389,4338,306,1208,36252,89577,6033,35597,66056,7930,27389,4338,306,1208,96586,22299,20662,84850,4558,21152,13088,373,99492,13,6178,72,11,4864,841,27389,3826,3675,11,10071,4864,66517,79071,14896,409,64972,13,22425,26584,11,4864,757,45640,2852,7010,514,27138,13,12095,4864,9189,834,272,96287,8065,1156,677,409,9160,569,11,3846,39904,8811,70,483,11,281,10610,292,27658,6033,35597,3197,409,281,14081,258,4306,13109,11,9189,87040,9189,13510,10071,934,17771,54312,934,80720,17317,15473,46452,13,34447,389,687,22550,11,4864,9189,44314,2852,951,59400,552,409,1647,72,2442,414,483,11,409,924,33920,2427,2177,24201,11,39043,9189,1370,273,25692,85815,653,28800,5636,13,56744,72,9189,11,11083,85321,513,57992,11,25692,85815,1744,3738,288,14848,46939,33537,978,4415,24918,13,19421,1370,8318,9189,11,9622,46138,11,14707,11,9189,47592,1862,978,13,23097,375,41881,45325,7010,20662,71632,294,6,582,3102,1133,11,951,12933,11,951,32118,8332,1354,11,951,274,1154,33651,2249,7364,409,9189,11,16968,1826,17508,6593,69068,11,6155,9769,69328,1880,3625,90551,65,5512,52579,665,2349,100198,665,4865,409,80259,13,34447,1765,12036,5048,6354,675,942,834,519,665,802,65220,11,48021,8065,38900,1880,96586,8065,38900,308,31769,85806,6502,13826,83972,51794,13,48109,74533,665,220,777,2790,11,1208,51223,16588,1826,653,76235,1133,55467,11,10071,3625,4787,409,17536,15132,27389,936,3946,1880,1208,6671,8528,60224,1826,27389,24719,5048,13,1252,90551,92174,1765,4848,11,308,6,57558,6502,326,6,9011,713,294,22827,459,13,220,1227,127036,272,17771,514,8941,818,1880,15878,829,97839,11,1880,348,265,2249,1824,2910,273,13026,409,274,1154,33651,2249,5019,326,6,49575,409,326,6,25108,273,13,33150,934,31109,7591,566,2910,13109,11,8065,19910,951,4046,74199,15760,1392,8952,4918,11,951,8811,17491,665,4156,275,409,934,35329,47090,88661,1143,4046,70312,16339,1880,653,893,593,3062,409,85505,409,77323,13,34447,436,395,554,89,28800,3869,28800,951,1097,73511,269,811,13,34447,665,220,777,2491,11,220,2790,11,777,1490,11,934,17771,54312,7930,264,2609,978,949,2895,66096,3869,7930,4068,949,19421,14707,5019,75871,265,3869,27750,4860,11,259,2053,23008,514,470,325,951,27138,77580,11,4864,296,6,2734,336,285,7010,934,80720,13,14465,91507,3869,1208,10607,409,779,625,15844,54401,409,91727,7010,26077,84921,1880,409,26077,85722,11,3846,15132,1097,73511,269,5512,15907,69792,90053,409,1208,29394,325,11,4415,24918,1880,46110,665,9822,13,14465,16006,2852,44767,294,6,16288,1208,85722,15890,11,8065,45369,409,326,6,90446,11,14848,4046,12821,96559,3625,12823,1880,3625,55744,8467,2145,519,3869,2773,283,35573,1208,77323,409,1208,296,12339,1880,409,326,41901,61827,11,3869,1097,73511,15171,3625,14726,8952,59307,1880,3625,4787,3869,1208,4415,24918,13,7695,3429,77422,1744,22463,841,274,17771,6502,20272,665,653,9880,13,19421,14707,20662,7645,35456,16968,4538,6225,13,2998,67781,11,514,72601,409,77323,1744,17317,4635,2852,38448,26725,75804,88253,3869,1208,58384,11,3869,9686,12,1399,57485,3869,3846,68866,978,1880,3869,829,296,10610,414,483,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4046,68019,326,6,90446,409,1208,77323,841,25692,513,20028,15878,4046,68019,326,6,90446,951,1343,40055,1910,1769,13,7695,274,6,74972,409,48021,3869,1208,2700,8047,409,26725,951,9517,66,1220,409,17536,7930,841,15132,7010,85624,2246,294,6,96912,11,85624,56984,13,19421,87320,6502,20028,665,80444,1744,514,10960,282,13559,48901,409,29449,32118,97495,22498,949,62408,85722,951,34280,811,294,6,90446,665,1208,21901,685,1765,951,47289,6489,625,1154,71925,6960,14707,951,33670,1154,13,62463,1343,40055,1910,15844,14848,17951,7010,28130,1841,65220,11,389,513,1323,17060,269,519,28130,7591,1010,11,28130,60020,13,19421,14707,11,27549,21559,3869,46131,1208,9517,49235,1516,951,2609,3808,13,62463,1343,300,296,6,306,5612,6316,87810,51199,68,13,4072,645,14848,16968,1469,403,978,79071,14896,409,51199,68,11,10071,4502,4864
