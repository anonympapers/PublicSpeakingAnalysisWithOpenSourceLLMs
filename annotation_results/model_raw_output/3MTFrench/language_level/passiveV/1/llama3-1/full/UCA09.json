To do this analysis, note down the TRANSCRIPT according to the questions of the QUESTIONNAIRE. For each question, you have three options: 0, 1, and 2 with explanations on what these options represent in the OPTIONS section. You should only choose one of these options and provide your answer in the format: Option chosen: 0, 1 or 2; Respond to the questions in the order they appear in the QUESTIONNAIRE.\n\n**QUESTIONNAIRE:** Question 8. In your opinion, on a scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of the passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\n**OPTIONS:**\n\n* 0 = No passive voice.\n* 1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\n\n\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nOption chosen: **2** (Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear)\n\nThe transcription contains numerous instances of passive voice constructions, such as \"I think that I'm not a part of the woman who makes the same thing\" or \"When you fixed me, you thought that I'd cut it in two pieces\". These sentences are often convoluted and ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the speaker's intended meaning. The excessive use of passive voice creates a sense of detachment and ambiguity, which can be confusing for the reader/listener.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,74407,805,1208,46940,409,1208,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,41447,25823,13,27058,3846,20028,20662,49586,11,5296,89,514,41447,25823,665,34501,951,4860,3930,3930,91022,7476,7618,13,27058,46777,3488,9189,47592,56321,2671,551,220,15,11,220,16,11,220,17,9952,951,1367,10939,1765,3846,1744,71925,6960,20662,3072,7010,32592,22327,52380,13,41621,841,87040,90194,934,31109,86806,409,27750,2671,1880,71751,1208,90509,32592,1208,57128,4194,25,5454,73661,648,25,220,15,11,220,16,6033,220,17,26,51223,76149,89,10253,4860,7010,326,6,541,265,39723,84568,7216,406,7010,514,91022,7476,7618,13,2331,53528,7476,7618,5941,14924,220,23,13,362,15265,55847,11,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,15,3869,220,17,11,4068,4046,970,89,45325,326,100017,409,1208,4160,953,28979,7010,514,2624,2530,409,20662,46940,949,58029,25,39723,220,15,284,24971,409,4160,953,28979,13,220,16,284,1252,28800,409,4160,953,28979,5019,1208,1206,472,978,13631,6,1735,344,13109,13,220,17,284,29179,953,28979,27639,7930,17634,514,69067,28800,1206,1334,26,60,41447,25823,284,510,220,103846,2383,64,11,2383,64,11,2383,64,11,21143,1666,6733,912,912,11,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,1102,596,4228,369,757,311,656,433,11,719,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,13,3277,358,2019,430,11,1606,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,11,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,9393,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,13,9393,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,9393,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,2030,358,1781,430,422,358,656,433,11,433,1053,15187,4287,856,9021,13,5112,358,3619,1268,2574,690,387,2884,13,358,1781,358,1541,956,617,264,3254,893,430,1102,596,682,358,1205,311,656,13,3277,499,8521,757,11,499,3463,430,358,4265,4018,433,304,1403,9863,13,499,3463,430,358,4265,4018,1578,264,6710,13,2100,358,1436,5622,499,449,264,22145,13,264,6710,315,43459,2403,856,18301,323,856,8071,13,362,1474,587,301,11,56270,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,42065,8886,11450,13,6914,279,5015,584,11,358,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,61734,7536,68063,38527,3059,279,46940,315,279,586,828,304,41447,25823,13,2057,656,420,6492,11,5296,1523,279,41447,25823,4184,311,279,4860,315,279,91022,7476,7618,13,1789,1855,3488,11,499,617,2380,2671,25,220,15,11,220,16,11,323,220,17,449,41941,389,1148,1521,2671,4097,304,279,52380,3857,13,1472,1288,1193,5268,832,315,1521,2671,323,3493,701,4320,304,279,3645,25,7104,12146,25,220,15,11,220,16,477,220,17,26,40633,311,279,4860,304,279,2015,814,5101,304,279,91022,7476,7618,382,9,9,53528,7476,7618,68063,16225,220,23,13,763,701,9647,11,389,264,5569,315,220,15,311,220,17,11,1268,656,499,15806,279,1005,315,279,28979,7899,304,279,41602,315,420,46940,1980,9,9,58029,68063,198,198,9,220,15,284,2360,28979,7899,13,198,9,220,16,284,362,2697,28979,7899,369,32373,60589,1968,13,198,9,220,17,284,1398,87728,28979,7899,430,3727,279,1495,25420,382,9,9,49873,25823,68063,1038,9,9,1111,984,75564,68063,198,5454,12146,25,3146,17,334,320,849,87728,28979,7899,430,3727,279,1495,25420,340,198,791,46940,5727,12387,13422,315,28979,7899,96939,11,1778,439,330,40,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,1,477,330,4599,499,8521,757,11,499,3463,430,358
