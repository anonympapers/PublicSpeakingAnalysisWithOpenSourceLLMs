For example, in the sentence \"La date-à-date, la donée véritable hornoire est de la compénie du digital,\" the use of passive voice makes it hard to understand who or what is performing the action of providing the data.\n\nOverall, while the transcript does use some passive voice for clarity and objectivity, there are instances where it can be improved by using more active and specific language.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,27677,454,4048,6390,29892,7890,8992,29920,7209,270,2663,782,11387,1597,10098,1518,1064,2073,29948,301,29915,21708,270,29915,29872,1314,18643,7719,29889,853,17488,29892,274,29915,342,425,5273,3901,332,316,29088,29891,29892,1601,26713,18926,29892,634,432,29915,1794,4224,24969,868,9073,443,26379,330,13796,521,542,324,271,29889,8748,1671,29871,4277,29892,1444,325,1759,1190,16631,1671,378,1100,1089,553,29869,316,1162,2353,29889,8748,18916,29892,274,29915,342,443,20491,270,29915,442,28833,868,13436,29889,1551,592,282,681,344,553,29869,29892,553,1162,21158,316,2723,275,457,29892,553,318,303,1934,29899,1270,29880,29892,553,29442,3110,1219,29892,289,999,29892,553,970,7719,1190,13327,29889,2581,337,28671,443,7446,479,270,29915,326,295,29899,280,29627,1190,5345,519,29873,29889,8748,782,2186,29892,432,29915,496,12973,1601,20207,316,1162,2353,29892,712,1444,301,29915,1794,1841,5231,16555,454,7431,2310,475,1465,443,1298,10208,275,29889,5202,276,358,6309,29892,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,818,3657,1308,2535,1601,13745,6710,2011,519,29892,2186,11728,454,29627,1190,5345,519,29873,29892,454,5646,263,1083,609,29948,270,29915,1639,2467,3132,29892,2298,289,4582,1524,29892,282,21167,29948,610,301,29915,29948,22529,427,325,3324,332,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,2257,20491,270,29915,442,28833,868,13436,29892,2257,7090,1597,8774,3068,1387,577,29888,19971,634,652,19388,1387,29892,22624,16444,1318,610,966,343,29899,22529,1934,818,8019,553,13698,868,13436,29892,27869,424,592,1020,7808,29892,282,2488,634,1104,25856,29889,9353,454,2560,541,29892,316,592,9073,3657,1308,454,27666,1136,352,357,29889,11948,3440,8164,29899,309,9073,29871,4277,29973,28079,1027,2037,610,346,439,29915,2719,4625,316,425,14735,1318,1190,19601,29892,425,2635,29899,30001,29899,1256,29889,997,2635,29899,30001,29899,1256,29892,425,1016,1318,27128,519,4029,1217,533,707,316,425,752,1690,347,868,13436,29889,853,7006,285,492,407,424,427,2245,29889,11948,364,465,545,29920,29899,23088,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,712,425,2635,29899,30001,29899,1256,29892,980,343,263,5695,316,301,29915,16063,475,29892,316,301,29915,2249,8194,29889,365,29915,3318,361,316,5345,519,29873,29892,427,21195,316,26805,29892,1136,2488,818,878,3610,7608,818,8019,316,11107,29892,316,1136,3011,14075,634,270,29915,14056,7734,29892,966,22060,2779,29884,2406,1190,2257,27965,1314,20067,2470,782,8774,3068,284,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,1750,409,21714,1465,425,17949,553,13154,1671,19397,7848,3588,275,634,3657,1308,29892,818,8019,316,7015,904,14817,1080,1750,3435,427,23778,29973,10016,2852,1151,12036,1318,29892,782,16573,316,29871,29906,29900,29900,29946,29892,1597,26744,29892,1721,375,316,17256,9744,29892,7629,276,712,301,29915,2249,8194,904,12232,23497,8121,29874,17889,4100,1465,454,544,895,316,4224,2459,29889,365,29915,2249,8194,904,12232,23497,29892,1190,544,27153,427,2245,29892,270,29915,348,21384,29892,8556,1029,787,425,2635,29899,30001,29899,1256,1750,8556,14924,270,29915,496,1308,7209,953,1457,6693,27688,29892,634,316,301,29915,18288,29892,8556,1029,787,5278,904,29885,8194,1750,8556,13417,277,818,782,2186,23532,1597,885,2333,782,29899,6144,30001,316,425,2635,29899,30001,29899,1256,29892,3503,782,6299,712,12852,27128,519,358,454,3132,29892,782,9657,403,316,425,14735,1318,1465,454,9122,868,13436,29889,1459,346,712,454,330,13796,782,2186,707,6079,2852,370,819,7814,521,542,324,1446,29892,634,274,29915,342,6079,19601,1750,966,3060,15773,29892,634,610,16631,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,2831,445,3414,29892,306,674,27599,278,1301,924,
