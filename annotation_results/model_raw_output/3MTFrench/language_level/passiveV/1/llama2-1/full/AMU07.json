The speech is given below:\n\n\"Once upon a time, three babies were born prematurely, that is before the end of the pregnancy. In France, more than 70,000 premature babies are born each year. These three babies, when they were born prematurely, were hospitalized in the neonatal department. To monitor or maintain their health, daily care such as frequent blood samples or respiratory support was provided. As an example, they received about 10 care procedures daily. And all seven babies experienced painful medical procedures during their lifetime, which can have long-term consequences such as increased sensitivity to pain, difficulty with language development, and memory problems. It is essential to efficiently relieve the pain of premature babies. Currently, we are limited in the pain relief interventions we can perform. Therefore, my thesis aims to evaluate whether using water therapy during a blood sample, alongside a pacifier, reduces the baby's pain. To do this, I will base my study on a small pilot test to ensure that the water therapy is feasible in practice, both for mothers and nurses, and a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis is a big word that means combining the results of several studies to make statistical calculations. What comes out is that there is a lack of studies specifically on premature babies, but water therapy seems to be the most effective. Familiarization, or prolonged exposure to water, before the blood sample, could reduce the baby's pain even more. However, premature babies do not always have the chance to get used to this water smell, and therefore, I will test whether water therapy during a blood sample reduces pain and whether placing a pacifier next to an epiglottis during the blood sample further reduces pain.\"\n\nFor each question in the questionnaire, I will choose one of the following options: 0, 1, or 2. The explanations for each option are as follows:\n\n0 - No voice passive: The text does not use any passive voice.\n\n1 - Some voice passive for clarity/objectivity: The text uses some passive voice for clarity or objectivity, but the majority of the sentences are in active voice.\n\n2 - Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear: The text uses a lot of passive voice, which makes it difficult to understand the main idea or follow the flow of the sentence.\n\nNow, based on the transcript provided, I will answer the questions in the order they appear in the questionnaire:\n\nQuestion 8: On an scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the use of passive voice in this transcript?\n\nOption chosen: 1 (Some voice passive for clarity/objectivity)\n\nThe text uses some passive voice for clarity or objectivity, but the majority of the sentences are in active voice. For example, \"These three babies, when they were born prematurely,\" and \"To monitor or maintain their health\" use passive voice to provide more information about the context. However, most of the sentences are in active voice, such as \"received about 10 care procedures daily\" and \"experienced painful medical procedures.\" Therefore, I choose option 1 for this
