The voice passive in the transcript is used in various ways, and I will evaluate it on a scale of 0 to 2.\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n0 = No voice passive (very rare)\n1 = Some voice passive for clarity/objectivity (most common)\n2 = Excessive voice passive that makes the text unclear (least common)\n\nBased on my analysis, I would rate the use of voice passive in the transcript as option 1: Some voice passive for clarity/objectivity. The speaker uses voice passive to provide information and clarify certain points, such as the type of train, the conditions of the tracks, and the causes of the phenomenon being described. This use of voice passive helps to create a clear and concise narrative, making it easier for the listener to understand the information being presented.\n\nTherefore, my answer to question 8 is: Option choisie = 1 (Some voice passive for clarity/objectivity).","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,323,424,424,424,1738,3219,360,420,592,3669,345,29889,2166,568,782,1437,336,2073,270,29915,348,7945,29892,454,1020,9639,707,1006,456,3746,29889,478,681,343,1136,352,371,29920,966,1591,2993,270,29915,3470,436,482,1671,10252,276,966,260,294,868,1020,9639,29889,2664,19518,427,4239,904,1171,29948,316,260,294,3435,818,26814,27963,1671,5646,23930,647,882,29889,360,29915,19908,4883,19313,29892,980,269,29915,23121,270,29915,348,28710,316,285,790,1973,1750,707,7132,29884,818,425,7101,553,18090,634,263,13417,277,818,6267,5796,415,545,29889,6803,6628,1314,7199,9030,2257,1374,1690,290,8146,29892,980,21668,409,715,549,261,782,274,16581,553,18090,29889,8526,301,29915,524,14508,316,2257,1775,4894,585,29892,966,1098,4835,3435,9577,6079,17459,743,634,883,267,443,21285,899,680,29889,11948,782,3261,634,818,29188,868,13382,553,22983,29892,11797,325,609,409,9982,6388,7608,9291,29915,30001,4642,1597,10640,9577,13855,488,818,7006,966,29540,16568,1173,29889,315,29915,342,7175,3476,15471,5278,8576,1750,269,29915,342,285,790,332,29948,634,818,13417,533,782,1437,336,2073,868,7945,29889,997,1650,1044,13498,1671,6896,2736,276,2257,25698,5000,1136,2488,818,1153,7451,261,425,7101,553,18090,29889,11948,18729,1302,30095,371,14954,29892,3503,1671,19601,14954,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,427,25695,271,270,29915,20082,5411,424,29889,4546,29875,29892,4883,5730,5908,13917,427,7783,29892,286,29915,29874,3635,275,270,29915,25378,966,7732,21349,9946,316,2257,1374,1690,290,8146,29889,28079,270,29915,24430,29892,425,5694,19113,29892,1671,8689,7015,14453,2406,9291,29915,30001,29871,29941,29900,29900,316,629,743,29889,1174,13495,29892,425,544,1211,11382,1318,610,454,772,4841,868,7945,316,29871,29946,29900,29900,260,24729,1671,1098,29948,914,966,14453,2406,634,454,3005,329,882,29889,951,1203,361,316,611,266,17449,707,1437,3891,12898,818,878,15340,5844,2249,15819,29892,19172,424,316,544,2487,533,1465,25178,4195,2947,409,4642,425,8576,16568,1173,29889,1174,18165,868,1134,316,7945,29892,634,553,5855,868,1020,9639,29889,997,269,2487,1064,271,29892,980,452,409,878,361,3055,2331,316,425,6701,2258,15529,2637,425,6276,371,634,432,29915,1794,325,1318,610,29875,29626,1924,29892,1750,452,24722,2331,7015,29871,29946,29900,7779,743,610,8694,634,425,6276,371,634,4837,2637,639,29886,1691,427,16413,7015,429,29899,12898,578,275,2535,23422,443,13219,272,610,8694,29889,1632,20032,818,1601,878,15340,29892,1444,26099,15390,316,544,2487,533,2257,712,2947,1014,381,454,8367,7907,18402,13382,316,7945,29889,11948,29892,8861,6896,499,271,29892,286,29915,29874,3635,275,270,29915,25378,966,21349,20542,818,5161,802,316,12409,316,8576,16568,1173,29889,6803,659,1241,2298,7175,3476,15471,1601,878,15340,29892,553,3686,1759,427,10212,20141,3435,544,5903,375,29889,405,29915,388,424,6836,260,29915,29948,914,270,29915,29891,8689,9073,343,818,27963,29892,21668,316,541,914,818,13164,29892,301,29915,333,1318,634,316,9483,533,454,13382,270,29915,348,6624,7289,29889,438,1481,29892,1444,24853,782,17887,7945,29892,3503,2257,302,29915,342,2331,2684,882,443,17887,7945,29892,3503,28185,9373,443,8367,10733,424,1190,27612,1597,22577,364,13375,316,29871,29953,7477,316,11502,30000,2484,2947,6282,1089,29889,1632,20032,818,1601,20629,29899,14968,29892,1444,724,1794,15390,316,9483,533,12694,1237,4072,316,7945,634,316,9483,533,301,29915,21871,27445,316,10741,8595,316,13382,316,7945,29889,438,29884,18916,29892,425,29871,29906,29955,26617,29892,980,707,8714,270,29915,12572,1841,29881,4087,1601,13659,1671,10019,1524,316,13164,3240,538,29889,323
