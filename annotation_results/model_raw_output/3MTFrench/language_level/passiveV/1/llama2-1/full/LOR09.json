The speaker uses passive voice to describe their own actions and accomplishments, such as \"I have used the absorption mechanisms of these plants to allow farmers to plant them on rich soil\" and \"I have created a startup ethical recovery of metals\". This helps to maintain a neutral tone and avoid any potential bias.\n\nOptions:\n\n0 - Pas de voix passive (The speaker does not use passive voice at all.)\n\n1 - Un peu de voix passive pour la clarté/l'objectivité (The speaker uses passive voice occasionally to enhance clarity or objectivity.)\n\n2 - Voix passive excessive qui rend le texte peu clair; (The speaker overuses passive voice, making the text unclear or biased.)","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,578,381,29892,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,7890,2437,1524,1465,443,17775,29889,2581,364,14056,5646,925,29872,270,29915,294,29899,29891,868,5053,29899,342,29892,316,301,29915,26917,26811,275,562,316,12340,484,585,29889,2581,302,29915,28899,275,2331,427,11757,2925,29889,435,29915,28899,275,427,1518,24773,1465,425,363,11992,9201,28148,1190,7015,260,29899,309,9364,296,553,715,3794,4805,536,1099,2658,29892,1750,409,302,473,29878,19047,553,8774,386,2631,868,899,29889,997,2362,9364,296,5695,553,16895,4285,29892,1750,302,29915,609,2331,4595,12784,818,4185,2147,634,712,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,263,1241,29889,435,29915,1794,28643,966,8774,3068,1608,267,270,29915,6897,272,683,316,7015,715,3794,1671,19172,276,3479,9221,12906,371,1295,316,966,3814,357,1190,553,25999,9577,8261,267,427,11510,2993,29889,315,3100,707,20737,12036,424,427,4092,29892,427,21805,347,29892,1190,553,25999,8164,9073,29899,29873,29899,309,2123,1437,11818,643,1577,8748,425,289,473,20141,316,3444,634,270,29915,22537,347,12931,1296,29882,29892,409,3435,4067,743,2535,966,610,1912,5233,2993,316,3792,1759,347,1671,9484,261,425,8861,610,29879,1808,9201,28148,553,260,29899,309,316,7015,2428,572,3794,29889,8748,992,309,30001,3440,1444,592,26099,5663,5128,29948,2778,316,11449,25226,818,301,29915,29282,316,29871,29906,29946,29889,28266,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,29871,29896,29947,29900,29900,29892,432,29915,1794,286,29915,542,4979,412,316,29871,29953,29947,29900,289,10126,29948,715,3794,1750,409,302,473,29878,19047,316,11510,2993,29889,365,29915,2015,484,585,707,977,424,29884,29892,409,2143,375,29892,425,302,473,29878,9948,818,301,29915,1117,8105,29948,29889,838,943,373,2947,966,623,7367,2331,5646,316,432,1662,29889,10043,5646,316,432,1662,640,993,2225,802,29871,29941,29995,316,25985,295,29889,10016,10098,1506,30095,12898,29892,274,29915,342,29871,29896,29900,29900,29995,4555,373,640,7081,29871,29941,29900,15543,315,29915,342,6079,2298,712,966,1375,1064,30000,16105,17541,4582,433,455,339,882,1750,452,640,23510,712,29871,29896,29892,29906,29995,25985,295,29889,1174,7438,29871,29906,29900,29896,29947,29892,2535,1597,25740,316,14954,1173,1295,7691,29892,8556,626,11689,427,2058,553,20075,4110,19172,424,316,10252,276,454,25985,295,1465,966,3438,9351,29899,303,19503,1465,966,610,3729,267,712,7890,992,4099,29920,589,9318,19601,29889,12390,714,2719,8556,19172,296,316,4048,6390,454,20299,882,868,25985,295,29889,1459,17488,29892,8556,19172,296,316,1841,1054,357,301,29915,14531,1750,3581,280,454,1472,553,20491,7545,1750,29370,454,899,2123,1750,3581,280,454,1472,553,534,681,29889,2581,592,7697,8648,9411,966,12134,17478,427,611,30085,29879,347,1671,8689,4883,289,10126,29948,715,3794,29889,2581,1841,1054,371,13214,868,899,712,432,29915,7054,895,818,425,10098,1190,454,28439,634,427,10212,20141,29892,18934,316,4880,261,13214,6267,3006,332,427,25985,295,29889,1632,20032,818,7015,6896,19718,29892,1465,4832,17478,29892,1444,3669,29882,1249,818,7594,1298,425,9257,316,7015,715,3794,634,7847,966,9946,29899,303,19503,427,25985,295,29889,9353,443,7006,2298,270,29915,348,385,29892,20737,29892,1444,2181,347,443,878,15340,29892,1601,509,261,818,7594,1298,425,9257,316,7015,715,3794,707,6366,815,634,23990,519,1671,427,9073,443,21423,316,13162,15471,818,301,29915,4548,417,7018,7903,332,29889,2726,14954,1173,1295,316,24190,8182,993,13547,944,2257,15744,1750,4625,9484,29948,1597,20234,2852,1387,316,1841,5231,10500,553,11510,2993,29889,315,29915,342,454,269,440,271,28643,2257,712,1444,4224,5128,276,818,2600,568,634,1444,301,
