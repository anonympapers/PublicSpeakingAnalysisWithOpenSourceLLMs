However, the transcription also uses active voice in other places, such as in the sentence \"With it, we build our cities and theaters.\" This balance between passive and active voice helps to maintain clarity and objectivity throughout the discourse.\n\nTherefore, I choose Option 1 - Some passive voice used for clarity/objectivity.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1954,22094,29920,443,508,291,1750,18402,19951,325,993,316,1437,1066,261,19398,26814,14931,1597,23690,29899,880,484,316,7067,316,11254,29889,315,29915,342,6079,29871,4277,29892,29871,29945,29900,29900,4679,359,425,4323,2131,316,11254,1391,568,18402,19951,1671,18402,19951,29889,26383,29871,4277,373,6787,277,1465,4883,373,29892,7814,4213,267,29892,7814,25574,29889,1954,22094,29920,8532,301,29915,6574,627,316,5278,5802,20364,1190,301,29915,21813,17239,29889,365,29915,20041,2546,868,11254,707,5544,519,1671,29871,29896,29900,29995,553,29579,316,4810,29906,1465,301,29915,271,7681,561,1908,29889,29871,29896,29900,29995,20498,882,1671,454,11254,29889,1551,707,427,7945,316,610,1358,4883,270,1280,634,4473,8894,316,301,29915,524,1064,11992,782,29899,280,29899,3746,27666,610,966,29871,30037,5888,3165,2708,8997,553,6476,7799,29889,8748,1671,29873,424,26744,452,872,277,1841,295,944,3440,980,18165,484,29889,6803,339,7768,2257,25574,452,269,29915,12352,898,276,2331,1577,2598,3181,654,274,29915,342,270,29915,279,3511,634,23532,818,5278,1139,29889,8748,1671,2257,9073,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,270,29915,12572,4880,261,2257,1750,409,21714,1465,7814,11254,818,301,29915,17192,1808,9200,21785,1387,29889,1174,4951,1072,19755,29920,29892,1444,286,29915,4422,895,3058,882,2331,818,443,20710,1883,4338,29889,1551,1601,371,13219,272,1654,575,29892,432,29915,1794,9484,29948,1601,17887,28704,24127,316,289,29948,880,818,301,29915,4194,7289,712,1444,21714,553,26893,634,553,26893,818,16455,643,8694,818,26245,29889,4231,6311,1444,3534,4664,712,432,29915,932,29878,1975,427,904,1111,362,712,270,29915,14559,9638,361,3783,1671,427,3667,7608,2535,301,29915,267,1129,381,316,14710,1893,7608,443,13164,11254,8296,6896,22137,634,2298,904,21553,1387,29889,2581,7890,1518,9854,2257,712,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,20480,1540,904,1111,362,29892,1444,2504,1691,29889,6803,9073,29871,4277,29892,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,270,29915,28619,443,6761,533,1597,298,6844,270,29915,27419,29889,10016,2778,345,1924,1509,298,6844,270,29915,27419,1750,409,21714,1465,1597,289,29948,880,5289,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,13624,9301,316,4239,16530,690,316,11254,2893,3783,316,8323,302,2445,1230,29871,1654,427,10767,29884,29889,1551,28078,27275,269,29915,18852,1465,425,5469,316,503,711,4026,302,2445,1230,409,1634,852,29889,1394,29892,2257,6101,302,29915,279,4401,2331,1465,454,11254,29889,405,359,4239,16530,690,302,2445,5056,3435,5246,267,619,743,23068,818,301,29915,2467,553,5697,1169,29871,2884,13686,10270,1750,409,6411,328,296,5695,1465,24145,289,29948,880,5289,29889,12390,29871,2884,13686,10270,409,282,605,296,2637,7814,4239,16530,690,316,11254,634,980,21668,6079,454,2970,1354,6042,296,2257,7303,29889,1174,26379,29892,11797,263,19047,4191,1597,23056,4191,316,289,787,626,275,4191,443,2637,15182,634,15096,29892,2123,1671,17161,261,634,6079,1190,18249,18097,6701,544,29145,5198,711,2638,743,29892,3691,1179,316,1671,29871,29941,29900,6063,29889,853,766,899,431,793,29889,8748,5695,443,766,899,431,793,15210,454,619,264,2637,7814,4239,16530,690,316,11254,29889,10016,707,818,18413,610,1597,4889,4805,536,21735,29889,315,29915,342,23068,818,5278,4889,712,454,11254,707,425,23056,818,2298,6896,22137,316,378,1037,348,5340,29892,712,2257,25574,1750,263,10440,316,25927,8997,712,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,818,610,1358,29889,2581,26099,269,30095,29878,439,29915,348,8694,29892,373,564,3511,29874,818,13942,29877,2496,1597,15217,5960,749,1750,1766,1173,316,425,6701,2258,15529,712,454,11254,11399,9139,29892,3503,21394,11387,1248,1236
