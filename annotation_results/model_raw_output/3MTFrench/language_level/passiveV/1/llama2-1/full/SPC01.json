In some cases, the passive voice is used for clarity or objectivity, while in other cases, it may be used excessively, making the text unclear.\n\nBased on my analysis, I would rate the usage of passive voice in the transcript as a 1, indicating that there is a bit of passive voice used for clarity/objectivity. The passive voice is used to provide more information about the situation and the people involved, without taking a direct stance or attributing agency to any particular group or individual.\n\nTherefore, my answer to question 8 is: Option chosen: 1 (A bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity).","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,4546,29875,29892,274,29915,342,443,4439,29889,2598,544,1690,290,1804,28821,831,1129,381,443,24418,915,29889,5984,6390,29892,274,29915,342,2257,1750,707,3390,29872,29871,29947,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,269,4894,575,29892,27786,782,5245,29899,29954,1947,29892,427,13783,6067,29892,818,796,801,1008,29875,29892,454,2298,4595,2148,272,361,29884,4087,782,410,14153,343,424,29889,8407,29871,29906,29900,29896,29945,29892,435,1064,609,439,29915,264,1020,30058,4977,301,29915,30057,1004,29889,853,17222,269,4894,264,316,29871,29906,29955,6063,29892,12931,766,1249,29892,373,286,29915,932,1808,454,18997,29915,15669,9897,688,631,29892,12866,29892,432,29915,932,29878,1975,553,6361,1041,29889,5701,301,29915,30057,1004,302,29915,14386,2331,454,20536,29889,2726,18025,260,5326,316,2143,688,631,29892,14954,11555,818,611,30058,509,7608,301,29915,574,11818,29892,3503,5695,301,29915,17120,21522,454,4719,868,5383,1054,782,7691,29889,11948,1671,339,7768,553,2143,688,4285,269,4894,575,29892,1750,610,280,29899,29873,29899,4277,24418,915,634,3435,10641,743,818,5278,25407,29892,409,1539,5646,270,29915,348,1302,818,23532,553,6361,1041,23428,574,5908,1465,443,25915,1801,688,631,29892,427,13783,6067,29892,443,9744,818,16155,283,29888,650,29889,5462,301,29915,7342,301,29915,2007,663,1671,23778,270,29915,932,29878,9030,1597,15217,25407,29973,6803,454,4224,5128,12416,29892,980,285,9864,277,7199,9030,6267,3008,28230,316,6361,351,631,634,6267,12450,9233,553,6361,1041,23428,574,5908,1465,443,4242,432,29915,1572,29875,610,553,288,292,1691,29889,315,29915,342,454,541,316,611,266,17449,29889,6803,844,22687,29892,432,29915,1794,5246,27962,443,1139,15421,818,29871,29906,29900,29900,2143,688,4285,1671,17043,13639,966,5855,316,6316,818,796,271,1306,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,26099,3240,2905,29948,1465,454,4242,29892,7629,276,29899,29873,29899,29876,381,2535,1597,1644,9874,270,29915,14056,23778,29892,875,9030,6267,22759,29892,1487,20689,29899,27048,29892,29845,634,26154,29892,760,351,29948,6267,13911,333,819,29889,18410,2708,4625,13162,7342,301,29915,296,2267,819,610,443,27869,29892,3440,29948,29892,4191,13704,316,872,301,420,29892,1750,4486,504,276,1487,15744,270,29915,3496,381,29889,360,29915,1300,29899,276,29899,29873,473,316,28439,29892,1444,1301,699,22572,29915,15669,18402,3184,29892,8955,9230,634,2730,647,1179,29892,4875,707,5153,9030,29889,7747,712,1444,1236,1314,7890,2970,29892,274,29915,342,712,14344,29899,27048,29892,274,29915,342,1601,13162,1893,882,316,4048,6390,712,29892,15733,29892,634,796,25201,29895,23213,29889,7747,4555,980,263,3008,28230,29892,274,29915,342,316,19397,610,1358,16464,29892,7209,27962,610,443,3534,5313,5411,29892,1671,5273,1484,13241,1597,1559,29080,29892,27962,443,875,2267,819,270,29915,290,1129,1173,29892,16219,381,1597,1671,29879,553,260,1041,29892,2123,443,17103,424,20196,5218,289,999,29892,1671,9364,276,1465,443,4242,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,1595,553,288,292,267,29889,13861,7697,276,553,6361,1041,29892,274,29915,342,8648,443,2730,11771,316,5663,8885,1970,8837,427,577,29875,29892,8288,439,29915,348,3477,488,316,6896,2638,663,29889,315,3100,14924,316,13942,29877,2496,316,26957,752,29948,841,778,634,316,2257,3435,29899,2719,29889,2664,6361,1041,3435,5695,385,532,1314,1671,454,18948,427,10375,29892,443,9744,712,966,1006,794,1080,23428,574,5908,8997,29871,29906,29900,29896,29896,4625,7697,29884,5644,332,309,262,802,29889,8748,1671,966,29026,29892,1597,24286,316,2298,12450,2016,1597,26558,316,2257,9587,29892,8164,29899,5474,712,10713,3248,1039,414,724,10
