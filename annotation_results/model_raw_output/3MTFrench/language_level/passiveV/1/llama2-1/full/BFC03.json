The transcript is:\n\n\"But what does she do with her European civil status? I am a jurist and I have said the civil acts. For you, it's just a simple administrative formality. In reality, civil acts, that's more than that. It's the entire set of acts that concern your life from birth to death. Birth certificate, marriage certificate, death certificate, that's your legal identity card on which are inscribed all the rights you have acquired throughout your life. Within the European Union, and more broadly around the world, these rights are not always recognized systematically by one state from another. If you decide to cross borders to settle or even acquire a new nationality, a state's sovereignty refuses to recognize an act because it does not correspond to its own law. In short, in this country, your legal identity would be lost. You would no longer exist juridically. The only way to avoid this is to study these different situations and try to find some coordination of the rules of law. For example, a madame Martin, married in France, could become a madame du pont, divorced in Germany. As a jurist, I have at my disposal international conventions, European regulations, treaties, court decisions, great principles of the European Court of Human Rights, and human rights. On which I rely to protect the rights of the European citizen. In my thesis, I will even propose a global solution. Why not create a unique civil status document that would be inscribed with fundamental rights, in agreement with the states, that could never be challenged. A European civil status document.\"\n\nFor each question in the questionnaire, we will provide the option chosen and the corresponding explanation:\n\nQuestion 8: On an scale of 0 to 2, how do you evaluate the usage of passive voice in this transcript?\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No passive voice.\n1 = A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity.\n2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear;\n\nAnswer: Option chosen: 1 (A little passive voice for clarity/objectivity).\n\nExplanation: The transcript uses a moderate amount of passive voice, mostly in the form of \"acts\" and \"document\" which provides some clarity on the content being discussed. However, the usage is not excessive, and the speaker's message remains clear throughout.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,11948,712,5246,29899,1808,316,325,9030,818,7006,17611,264,1577,2581,26099,11099,2488,634,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,966,260,294,14175,2719,29889,6803,7890,29892,980,452,269,29915,23121,3058,882,712,316,2560,11595,2131,19185,29889,1174,22259,2131,29892,966,260,294,14175,2719,29892,274,29915,342,6079,2298,712,29871,4277,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,24031,553,1044,267,1750,378,2265,484,26814,6316,316,26814,1055,9948,9291,29915,30001,26814,5758,29889,3185,29872,316,1055,9948,29892,316,15182,482,29892,316,4224,2093,29892,274,29915,342,26814,20206,270,29915,1693,2131,11099,333,1387,1190,22025,3435,28580,768,29879,9411,966,4441,1169,712,7890,8992,29920,1274,7680,5646,782,1472,316,26814,6316,29889,8407,2757,316,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,634,2298,16805,944,1465,454,9122,875,631,29892,274,29915,342,17950,1671,452,2331,7848,29892,452,3435,2331,13107,2249,2219,339,882,8265,29876,375,270,29915,348,2852,271,443,14857,29889,6101,7890,1437,8204,29920,316,1020,369,643,966,4565,29038,29892,1671,7890,27786,6701,8714,1671,20946,4193,1465,443,14857,9744,29892,443,2852,271,868,22916,316,872,3669,369,475,300,29948,29892,1671,443,2143,375,29948,316,25238,13639,443,1044,29872,29892,610,346,439,29915,309,452,3928,2331,818,872,26138,24228,29889,1174,1047,1004,29892,1465,2257,9744,29892,325,359,4441,1169,724,609,11113,375,29889,478,681,302,29915,735,1531,1249,2298,11099,333,8105,882,29889,405,29915,296,5705,8284,1136,2488,818,2852,566,631,7015,28374,18845,634,3686,388,6096,316,17124,4630,1597,2284,9874,29311,3381,553,27264,793,316,17950,29889,6803,10019,1524,29892,443,10395,420,6502,29892,15182,29948,427,3444,29892,425,285,30057,1173,1509,29892,4883,263,794,1973,29892,316,316,15470,10395,420,868,13185,29892,25074,16100,427,838,18453,29889,1174,11172,712,11099,2488,29892,432,29915,1794,553,714,2719,818,611,27963,29889,2664,13064,1080,6121,267,29892,966,27264,944,29879,17611,575,29892,966,1020,7719,29892,966,1437,3476,1080,316,425,6325,316,15426,316,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,966,22114,3420,267,316,425,6325,29211,29892,553,4441,1169,316,301,29915,21708,29889,6298,966,339,4999,29892,1444,286,29915,932,29884,347,1671,7175,2974,966,4441,1169,868,274,2049,11771,17611,264,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,1444,9551,1572,29875,6701,1597,1650,13149,744,29889,6803,339,7768,452,2331,9484,261,443,1044,29872,5412,1190,27612,25810,28580,768,29892,427,15017,2535,966,12503,29892,553,4441,1169,6299,1166,2993,29892,1750,452,1671,8356,18413,7848,1083,275,427,4556,29889,853,1044,29872,270,29915,28323,7631,17611,264,29889,11948,21181,302,29915,342,8121,29948,29892,634,4191,443,904,339,15943,276,2488,29892,432,29915,485,749,427,17124,13775,454,2923,25123,904,339,15943,276,2637,270,29915,348,21384,29892,966,3896,2872,553,12503,634,316,301,29915,18288,29892,425,17176,29948,553,4348,375,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,2831,278,7418,310,278,970,1301,924,4944,29892,591,674,671,278,1139,15421,2183,304,14707,278,8744,310,1209,573,7314,297,278,12032,29889,450,1301,924,338,29901,13,13,29908,6246,825,947,1183,437,411,902,7824,7631,4660,29973,306,626,263,11099,391,322,306,505,1497,278,7631,14741,29889,1152,366,29892,372,29915,29879,925,263,2560,19185,883,2877,29889,512,16832,29892,7631,14741,29892,393,29915,29879,901,1135,393,29889,739,29915,29879,278,4152,731,310,14741,393,5932,596,2834,515,12060,304,4892,29889,350,7515,12289,29892,13718,12289,29892,4892,12289,29892,393,29915,29879,596,11706,10110,5881,373,607,526,1663,23059,599,278,10462,366,505,16692,10106,596,2834,29889,23732,278,7824,7761,29892,322,90
