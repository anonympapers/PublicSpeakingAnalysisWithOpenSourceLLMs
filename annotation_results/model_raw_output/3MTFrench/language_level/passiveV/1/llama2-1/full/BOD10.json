The use of passive voice helps to convey the objectivity of the speaker's evaluation of the Stradiverny project, as well as their focus on local resources and sustainability. However, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions to provide additional clarity and emphasis. Overall, the balance between active and passive voice is appropriate for the context and purpose of the transcript.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,461,2656,381,17887,818,17887,316,425,20674,347,868,282,1893,12154,1577,22310,895,29920,425,18475,1167,1887,29892,7209,6337,261,553,4048,6390,29899,29888,5218,7242,575,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,29892,454,15744,3767,328,2147,1460,29889,3767,328,2147,1460,29892,2123,29875,29892,4191,3767,328,2147,1460,29892,2535,23743,29891,589,9318,29889,6803,339,7768,1577,382,29882,6079,29892,818,425,274,2131,316,425,15188,818,3681,29892,6722,980,343,263,1597,17188,29876,1647,4333,316,7015,5537,787,29892,980,263,4370,4224,23048,712,6267,23743,29891,6303,4655,9407,358,5541,29948,270,29915,348,286,3610,927,316,784,3021,1662,634,270,29915,6905,488,316,301,29915,348,29889,10016,9238,29883,293,1230,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,1750,269,30000,1173,29892,5695,818,7006,301,29915,29948,4909,553,1236,262,5888,29889,7747,15744,1136,2488,12866,818,301,29915,20041,2546,12036,1318,297,369,1240,29892,1750,12852,17799,29899,29879,473,16100,634,1750,269,29915,262,1028,533,29892,553,4048,6390,29899,29888,5218,7242,575,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,6427,8284,782,10212,20141,29892,343,7175,358,29892,1190,425,15284,689,29872,29871,29896,29900,2383,818,9122,29899,29885,1503,424,29889,478,681,7890,7845,24448,29892,9122,29899,29885,1503,424,29892,274,29915,342,1465,966,301,18684,29892,274,29915,342,18916,6722,980,343,263,454,508,538,29892,3503,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,712,454,508,538,1465,966,301,18684,29889,1105,277,29871,29896,29955,1273,868,22922,707,1162,8885,371,610,425,27965,1509,363,11992,301,29915,355,5340,29889,9353,301,29915,404,663,15963,29892,707,454,6788,1766,21998,29892,634,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,265,8164,9073,2535,454,6788,1766,21998,29973,8396,29892,553,13900,521,283,30085,29879,29892,3503,373,8164,5695,454,330,30037,1089,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,454,17065,29948,1671,1841,1054,357,872,6896,457,29889,5701,6896,457,29892,1750,707,5541,29948,270,29915,1540,8691,15617,680,29892,301,29915,404,663,316,1935,5606,29894,20578,634,270,29915,1540,8691,899,680,29892,301,29915,562,324,3021,1662,29889,438,1481,29892,425,6701,784,3021,1662,712,29871,4277,22700,1249,610,9630,3767,328,27432,1671,966,1436,2187,316,7015,5537,787,29889,7740,424,454,330,19553,482,29892,274,29915,14386,1597,23837,347,611,1324,545,868,22922,301,29915,355,1318,29892,3503,980,269,29915,264,707,599,29948,1671,553,10505,1946,583,29892,766,787,11387,298,3409,11992,29899,276,1509,29892,269,4987,712,8556,1465,966,301,18684,29892,373,263,4193,1249,6079,439,29915,309,6664,7081,454,330,19553,482,29889,315,29915,342,1671,18729,712,301,29915,265,3686,15802,316,16497,7608,3999,1391,1169,29892,13214,872,784,3021,1662,29892,1841,649,6096,270,29915,1540,4021,2131,3682,23497,29889,3872,29883,1601,325,7181,29892,427,2298,270,29915,29874,680,868,12507,2265,29892,3667,895,425,18475,1167,15068,29892,2331,454,508,538,29892,1661,1661,29889,997,784,3021,1662,29889,3872,29883,1671,409,9073,3999,1027,2701,29892,1444,544,1975,8997,454,1472,29892,1444,521,585,17615,29892,432,29915,1175,2663,316,425,784,3021,1662,29892,1444,521,585,17615,10440,29892,432,29915,1175,2663,13545,788,277,10270,29892,3390,434,1314,316,425,3814,12973,29892,373,6896,1111,533,29892,1444,521,585,17615,10440,29892,634,274,29915,342,6624,29948,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,301,29915,932,9854,1190,553,904,13775,453,787,316,592,431,793,29892,1444,269,30000,1173,29892,634,432,29915,24209,344,7015,1559,23096,707,1893,3783,634,8774,3068,3783,29892,4191,610,17488,29892,425,1506,647,749,29892,425,3581,2051
