{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-16T18:10:53.165194744Z","response":"\nFor this task, I will analyze the transcript provided and answer the questions in the order they appear in the questionnaire.\n\nQuestion 8: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you rate the use of passive voice in the transcript?\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No passive voice used.\n1 = Some passive voice used for clarity/objectivity.\n2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\nMy answer is: 1 (Some passive voice used for clarity/objectivity). The transcript uses passive voice in some places to provide clarity and objectivity, such as in the sentence \"Le barbue peut suivre tous mes déplacements et alors comparer matématiquement les formes de mes plongés de mes movements.\" Here, the use of passive voice helps to clarify the meaning of the sentence by using a more objective tone. However, the transcript also uses excessive passive voice in some places, which can make it difficult to follow the narrative and understand who is performing the actions described. Overall, I would rate the use of passive voice in the transcript as moderate, with a mix of both clear and unclear uses.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,12660,29888,519,712,8556,1029,787,11878,818,623,29878,9030,427,3444,712,7890,2852,26477,316,1791,261,29889,751,295,1912,1506,2247,316,1147,276,29892,2284,267,29892,3503,26154,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,301,29915,314,11251,29889,11948,1444,872,275,439,29915,309,19947,1597,3036,744,712,7890,302,29915,1351,29920,2331,11878,425,8825,270,29915,932,29878,9030,29889,315,1808,316,425,10135,23581,29890,4926,712,1444,325,1759,7890,752,357,29889,365,29915,29948,6591,316,2778,707,454,1302,305,265,29889,853,367,585,611,13639,634,966,6299,29879,316,2778,29892,7907,553,17478,1465,301,29915,542,29948,273,29892,6303,316,18948,427,1840,267,29892,1302,2593,29948,270,29915,348,23428,927,7877,15471,29889,853,9712,276,1314,1302,305,265,269,29915,3451,361,8356,29889,1720,269,29915,2749,9061,2331,1671,269,29915,29891,276,535,29883,546,29889,341,1803,276,553,14452,1039,414,270,29915,29948,561,359,2131,267,29892,1750,263,301,29915,18949,927,9090,29872,1671,439,7768,373,301,29915,4582,536,707,8288,1437,2543,11728,29889,6298,330,473,29885,4167,29892,15093,13413,4555,1444,26099,20075,29948,29892,14924,443,4595,923,345,1314,29899,29880,329,316,11510,566,631,29889,360,29915,19908,7015,2970,29892,427,15093,427,28353,29892,425,1757,815,282,17449,1190,454,27264,484,13019,631,29889,2664,8714,3435,3479,22299,634,1518,5795,29892,13214,316,7814,8774,386,2631,270,29915,284,2073,362,29889,951,2594,29890,434,8164,10252,276,9411,4883,17631,4620,4110,634,8532,5734,261,1775,2249,2219,339,882,966,883,267,316,4883,715,549,743,316,4883,20758,4110,29889,1720,286,29915,29874,610,12898,270,29915,294,1103,553,6367,1080,29892,992,309,30001,966,286,1862,270,29915,1540,3151,347,1509,316,13433,29889,11948,980,263,13612,449,29948,818,11469,2893,29792,7732,22114,2318,267,316,20299,4110,316,715,549,29948,29889,1222,572,12418,29892,1444,1437,1760,9577,2600,898,15471,29889,405,545,454,1437,14641,1671,610,16589,12416,2298,966,904,29885,575,29892,966,5528,307,3761,453,1849,1320,8463,575,1006,1066,1934,2637,19601,634,966,772,790,787,4555,1444,26099,269,29915,361,374,296,29889,10731,29892,1354,4323,2131,316,410,6609,1634,5908,2123,1354,966,2085,1934,325,23510,818,6282,29890,291,1089,29892,1444,1735,270,29915,284,1973,818,425,553,21450,432,1165,29948,301,29915,1466,1671,1283,1581,634,818,6267,302,473,12416,2257,11943,17016,29889,360,29915,279,3511,29892,5162,6079,302,473,768,29892,1444,592,425,5582,16454,29889,1459,966,2085,1934,4868,29892,1444,592,425,5582,639,2265,29889,2581,1236,1314,8532,592,23837,7608,29892,4697,29539,634,521,9498,425,2298,1597,663,316,3667,2131,29889,853,270,29915,29882,3121,519,358,29892,454,20536,20299,882,6309,712,24145,626,473,2265,707,13704,270,29915,290,4600,29889,897,1487,1083,572,381,425,19957,2535,1437,506,29948,4771,29892,2535,282,533,3623,9948,634,26104,1663,681,5597,29889,24337,269,482,634,966,6299,29879,316,2778,29892,872,1034,311,29892,443,2560,3440,5218,29889,2664,270,29915,264,29878,2406,316,26814,18249,3435,4046,743,29889,478,327,276,20299,882,29892,409,16374,7848,7744,29948,29889,4785,309,30001,425,4329,1297,439,29915,309,7890,21668,594,19959,1671,452,2331,875,11665,26814,282,1064,2108,2131,29889,16457,29881,1280,29892,4473,8894,29892,7890,301,29915,6698,1249,7199,275,29889,435,29915,404,15802,270,29915,4548,492,7808,3440,966,966,6299,29879,316,2778,2258,1169,29892,2257,2245,8556,1047,4467,297,5030,519,22572,29915,15669,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,7744,29948,29892,274,29915,342,20299,882,29892,782,4365,484,585,316,1487,12471,17239,29889,8748,425,1139,409,18593
