I will answer the questions in the order they appear in the questionnaire.\n\nQuestion 8: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you assess the use of passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No passive voice used.\n1 = Some passive voice used for clarity/objectivity.\n2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear;\n\nMy answer is: 1 (Some passive voice used for clarity/objectivity). The transcription uses passive voice to provide a clear and objective explanation of the topic, particularly in the introduction and throughout the narrative. The use of passive voice helps to emphasize the actions and events described, making the text easier to follow and understand. However, the amount of passive voice used is not excessive, which allows the speaker to maintain a neutral tone and avoid any potential confusion.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,1671,7890,1518,492,7808,454,29140,316,611,266,17449,29892,1444,325,1759,7890,1153,535,357,301,29915,13624,13568,579,1387,1465,22922,6397,12836,29889,1954,351,4983,425,752,357,29892,7209,7209,29899,264,7907,425,22104,316,301,29915,273,327,29889,28266,29892,2257,22922,263,25456,425,1841,4068,6397,12836,29892,634,16134,424,29892,966,5189,743,316,301,29915,20041,2546,29889,8748,274,29915,342,9577,25698,2249,15819,610,346,712,925,882,29892,425,752,357,707,1437,14081,1647,316,301,29915,20041,2546,29889,6803,7848,2298,16784,895,29892,425,752,357,707,1044,27751,8022,1318,610,301,29915,20041,2546,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,634,269,29915,27601,434,301,29915,342,3780,634,10484,5606,2637,966,1667,29879,868,2320,275,819,29892,838,29920,27400,634,868,10684,19507,14090,29889,897,2257,455,29892,274,29915,342,6628,1314,28185,9373,26842,404,29948,610,270,29915,14559,6367,1080,29889,6298,5646,712,454,21149,5411,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,263,6079,1874,29948,634,712,425,3022,26841,707,21617,29884,16403,29889,951,3669,455,29892,274,29915,342,712,7015,5189,743,17424,28065,296,12563,1597,10375,270,29915,14559,25698,19503,29889,2726,2320,1654,575,1750,760,296,29892,1437,2634,19047,29892,1750,6013,358,29892,2298,25235,316,18848,1671,966,298,30069,29886,986,29879,29889,1174,2298,29892,9411,7015,7877,29948,1860,302,2445,5056,409,4325,1454,1760,2637,29899,30001,8019,316,18916,29892,3440,373,5246,1671,2656,381,868,5147,2841,1998,29884,29889,2664,11009,743,3984,267,427,19601,29892,2947,7890,2970,439,29915,1540,8691,316,425,1650,29892,274,29915,342,712,425,752,357,16391,316,10984,2993,21149,11620,818,13942,29877,2496,634,712,3911,19172,296,316,1104,25856,1487,23837,347,427,425,6894,361,819,29889,11948,274,29915,342,301,29915,562,4277,29899,339,29915,348,346,29889,897,301,29915,473,911,13258,11537,1209,1318,29892,1597,286,2249,14119,21136,1808,19624,29892,553,704,3246,6919,29948,841,778,11266,23662,275,743,29892,29871,4277,5246,712,425,9460,868,9728,707,752,492,17851,29889,5202,276,358,6309,29892,425,752,357,707,6668,339,1318,1465,443,885,28951,29889,853,885,28951,1750,6303,1120,999,11505,13686,361,29892,3503,1750,22572,29915,15669,20202,1465,443,2723,277,276,7067,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,2453,1314,7199,9030,439,29915,4999,3435,966,7877,29948,1860,1750,3710,30037,305,296,425,752,357,316,6894,6832,743,1487,5039,2131,634,966,7877,29948,1860,1750,29892,782,6761,533,29892,1671,904,1358,553,263,1874,29948,316,23324,14119,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,1444,325,1759,270,29915,24430,1015,29539,443,652,21780,868,22922,23068,818,443,7774,1946,2488,472,342,1387,29889,11948,992,309,30001,29892,1597,10098,439,29915,265,263,1597,18551,13149,744,553,5189,743,634,553,6668,339,1179,868,22922,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,265,5246,29973,6803,25497,276,818,5278,1139,29892,1444,325,1759,2852,566,631,966,2852,4749,743,29892,966,2852,4749,743,29892,966,1098,17718,634,18475,2863,316,425,752,357,427,1757,424,553,2637,2034,575,782,16573,553,704,3246,29889,7747,1750,2947,592,19172,276,270,29915,711,2974,3440,980,544,4584,6267,15422,427,1667,29889,1459,346,712,2123,29875,29892,966,704,3246,544,2108,296,6267,15422,427,1667,29889,1720,21668,4048,6390,439,29915,309,19947,1597,28812,316,425,694,29872,1106,284,29892,5541,1318,316,2117,21835,270,29915,20041,2546,29892,904,6092,29892,274,2049,29891,575,634,22898,293,1446,634,1841,348,583,26269,316,410,27499,3817,29892,553,2832,3783,14649,1912,29889,2598,541,29892,274,29915,342,316,7199,9030,3440,5278,28812,18165,484,
