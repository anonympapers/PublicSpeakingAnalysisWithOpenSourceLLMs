The questionnaire includes a single question:\n\nQuestion 8: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you assess the use of passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No passive voice used.\n1 = Some passive voice used for clarity/objectivity.\n2 = Excessive passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\nThe transcript is:\n\n\"In the context of Mathèse, I lead enterprises at the Prédâche-Theur and responsible for each. There are many of these enterprises, and I met Frédéric, an buyer, who told me what happened to him. The software saga. Frédéric was in charge of buying the new software for the commercial service. A supplier offered 80,000 euros, another supplier offered 100,000 euros, after careful consideration Frédéric chose the one who offered 80,000 euros, they thought they were making a good deal. But what Frédéric hadn't anticipated was the complexity of the software, which made it difficult for the commercial team to understand and communicate with the clients. It was a loss of business that generated stress for the team, and Jean-Passe Frédéric had not predicted it. Because it wasn't included in the software and tools for purchases, and it was very hard to quantify. So, how can things change? And that's the objective of my thesis. I am building a model that can identify visible and hidden impacts and construct this model within an organization using a socio-economic approach developed by professors, experts, capstal, and other researchers. I interview acheteurs, responsables, and users. I collect qualitative and quantitative financial information. I analyze the data with me, the bourrat, the reader, to construct my model. I will add this to the model. The innovative enterprise will have the first tool capable of identifying impacts on work conditions and organization. And I'll put you at ease in the end. I see a socio-economic model that is simple, easy to understand, all companies, including service sector companies, thousands of hidden costs, able to identify delays, and impact on work conditions and organization. And that, don't you think it will change work conditions?\"\n\nBased on the transcript, I would answer question 8 as follows:\n\nOption chosen: 1 (Some passive voice used for clarity/objectivity)\n\nThe transcript uses passive voice to provide clarity and objectivity in certain parts of the text. For example, in the second paragraph, the sentence \"It was a loss of business that generated stress for the team\" is written in the passive voice, which helps to emphasize the impact of the software's complexity on the team without placing blame on any individual. Similarly, in the last paragraph, the sentence \"I see a socio-economic model that is simple, easy to understand\" is also written in the passive voice, which helps to highlight the simplicity and accessibility of the proposed model.\n\nTherefore, I choose option 1 (Some passive voice used for clarity/objectivity) to answer question
