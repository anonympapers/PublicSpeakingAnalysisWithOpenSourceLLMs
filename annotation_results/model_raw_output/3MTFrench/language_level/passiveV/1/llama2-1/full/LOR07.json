The author uses passive voice to provide a clear and objective description of the situation, but also to avoid direct attribution to specific individuals or groups. I would score this usage of passive voice as 1 on the scale of 0 to 2, with 0 representing no use of passive voice and 2 representing excessive use that makes the text unclear.\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n* 0 = No passive voice used.\n* 1 = Some passive voice used for clarity or objectivity.\n* 2 = Excessive use of passive voice that makes the text unclear.\n\nExplanation: The author uses passive voice to describe the situation, focusing on the actions performed by the machine rather than the individuals involved. This use of passive voice helps to provide a clear and objective description of the situation, but it also avoids direct attribution to specific individuals or groups. Therefore, I would score this usage of passive voice as 1 on the scale of 0 to 2.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,712,5246,443,17222,12377,424,18097,373,3911,1539,1597,1591,24087,1465,966,1667,29879,1671,425,12563,8861,10098,29889,382,29882,6079,9577,25595,358,29892,980,5246,2257,330,4196,29889,997,1591,24087,707,13547,944,27951,361,712,6701,443,12377,424,1750,302,29915,29874,18413,4370,427,6958,2535,425,7199,264,1457,427,2225,802,14426,273,15471,29889,315,29915,342,4191,1354,454,5147,345,585,634,425,5722,5458,15777,5335,29890,374,339,743,29892,4191,1354,980,16623,1249,8691,270,29915,348,5646,29889,997,4933,707,8532,454,27044,882,316,301,29915,267,19428,29889,6340,4145,915,454,7019,1464,29892,4875,454,1083,572,329,639,1454,358,29889,6101,425,5722,5458,707,6079,2258,568,29892,4875,8164,12866,316,15470,443,27128,519,760,2386,533,1671,301,29915,21708,29889,11948,712,2257,1209,277,8532,29892,28194,966,14884,452,3435,2331,1354,27951,10270,712,29871,4277,29889,751,4999,3435,966,1136,21871,2063,1190,26814,5039,2131,1577,4785,1654,966,5155,712,1444,592,18593,1465,4883,17124,6609,29889,1954,22094,29920,29899,29876,681,610,17488,712,7890,29871,22730,1015,1064,7289,1190,966,521,22702,316,7629,482,14255,3938,5710,327,634,712,5278,4933,269,29915,342,2331,1597,1591,24087,29892,3503,425,6316,409,269,29915,1300,19964,15826,2535,22025,7890,2906,26477,2329,261,3503,15243,454,784,4926,707,270,29915,1540,868,364,1541,1004,29889,8407,2298,260,9373,29892,454,784,4926,316,4239,868,364,1541,1004,610,992,17252,12852,12471,29871,29947,29900,29900,784,27801,316,868,364,1541,1004,610,8694,29889,8748,6079,8532,29892,1354,26814,325,895,1509,302,29915,342,2331,544,15819,29892,610,27951,361,29892,2331,2258,21873,818,3667,7608,29892,1354,4875,302,29915,342,2331,454,27044,882,316,26814,831,19428,29892,7890,8992,29920,4239,6851,29889,997,8861,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,29231,5495,11387,325,568,29889,11948,1465,1597,2637,7734,4191,443,7006,8694,29892,1597,992,17252,18402,1473,16731,29889,3201,29894,737,944,29899,9854,302,29915,342,12866,2331,325,336,2073,1597,2984,29889,997,26617,1650,29889,8748,427,5246,29892,425,25642,29892,274,29915,342,712,7890,4327,26477,26814,2258,15529,316,29231,5495,29889,5462,7890,594,481,26477,782,20299,882,316,26814,714,309,29892,3503,5278,13852,263,443,17103,25323,277,361,29889,1704,5278,10098,29892,274,29915,342,7890,1750,4788,29920,316,7869,4145,1358,634,425,2723,457,316,26814,714,309,29889,478,681,4788,29920,316,7869,286,2249,272,7608,553,19313,634,7848,1098,296,361,782,11387,316,1841,29883,647,284,1671,343,946,381,782,2298,325,568,29889,323,9373,29899,24442,538,29892,2257,17103,25323,277,361,29892,263,7006,966,21090,6042,2122,29889,12549,2411,5761,26814,6079,29899,5474,634,26814,4180,29889,478,681,4788,29920,6701,8164,29899,5474,782,25927,270,29915,348,3256,427,364,30037,369,425,26245,634,18475,296,381,553,4662,280,1295,11469,301,29915,326,2590,270,29915,5474,1190,1527,1318,29889,478,681,4788,29920,5695,9073,553,13930,1295,2123,6079,553,521,15806,325,359,21038,818,301,29915,29948,10936,29892,610,17488,29889,4526,276,818,2630,29892,274,29915,342,316,9073,427,29835,712,14255,3938,5710,327,5278,8323,6042,744,12852,23483,1318,21975,425,26192,553,1400,267,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,432,29915,711,16349,966,1015,1064,14075,2637,443,18848,634,1444,966,2706,267,29892,432,29915,24209,344,6267,20299,882,634,432,29915,1693,28821,553,18845,6722,980,19947,443,904,13823,2637,454,20299,882,553,14884,634,966,1098,9030,553,1015,1064,14075,29889,2726,18845,6722,966,1015,1064,14075,437,27649,9073,443,7225,1462,12898,358,5218,1671,269,29915,21412,818,6267,714,309,29889,1174,4951,29892,1444,16193,
