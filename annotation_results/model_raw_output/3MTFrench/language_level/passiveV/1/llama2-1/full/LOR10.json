The use of passive voice helps to emphasize certain points, such as the fact that the forest is growing for over 150 years and the impact of climate change on its expansion. However, the excessive use of passive voice can make the text less clear and difficult to follow at times.\n\nThe speaker uses phrases like \"la forêt française augmente depuis maintenant plus de 150 ans\" (the French forest has been growing for over 150 years) and \"le changement climatique a des effets sur la croissance de la forêt\" (climate change has an impact on the forest's growth). These passive constructions help to focus attention on the object of the sentence, which in this case is the forest's growth.\n\nHowever, there are also moments where the use of passive voice becomes more pronounced, such as when the speaker talks about the \"simulateur de croissance\" (growth simulator) and how it can predict the future expansion of the forest. In these instances, the passive voice makes the text less clear and more difficult to follow.\n\nOverall, while the use of passive voice in the transcript helps to emphasize certain points, it also makes the text less clear at times. A balanced use of active and passive voice would likely result in a clearer and more engaging narrative.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1750,25763,7890,302,29915,29874,18413,409,4370,17043,13639,1487,263,15470,29892,1750,302,29915,29874,18413,8092,425,14051,14090,540,545,1509,1302,4798,316,1487,8955,1671,611,760,29892,1444,260,2016,316,7175,2974,301,29915,3496,381,316,425,363,11992,11076,29889,838,943,2123,29875,29892,818,2257,380,1943,29892,12852,7890,452,286,29915,264,1437,29892,3503,980,452,1671,8356,2331,28185,9373,544,2487,381,4457,265,1354,373,1083,609,276,443,8694,427,619,264,29892,12784,9301,29892,12852,7890,270,3246,3503,818,439,7768,274,29915,342,29899,346,712,425,363,11992,269,29915,932,681,344,1661,634,7890,8992,29920,610,5444,17334,18836,29889,997,4323,2131,316,23734,316,425,363,11992,11076,11307,2689,8997,16134,424,2298,316,29871,29896,29945,29900,6063,29892,3503,443,9703,316,330,30057,2167,5278,8182,9948,363,11992,380,1908,29892,454,1874,882,10784,15819,29889,6803,4048,6390,818,7594,1298,966,363,29145,3435,325,348,381,818,26003,29899,264,29899,305,326,15819,29892,980,707,23309,270,29915,424,1654,546,6267,3105,332,29889,1459,17488,29892,1354,454,337,305,283,358,707,29899,29884,4239,4239,867,743,270,29915,1654,29871,29906,29900,6063,29892,3440,966,363,29145,325,609,7848,1841,351,381,29889,1174,17043,9948,2257,3105,332,8556,1671,12628,626,15817,9386,301,29915,351,7018,363,11992,380,1908,18934,270,29915,29948,672,966,363,29145,818,286,29915,3610,29884,1308,8474,454,1874,882,10784,15819,29889,1174,7853,275,424,29892,610,17488,29892,966,286,3610,6916,20491,453,375,11009,361,13546,1465,7814,363,29145,29889,6803,17043,13639,301,29915,3496,381,316,425,363,11992,29892,1444,260,29915,275,1661,2331,1597,16380,280,316,15919,2122,29892,3503,443,29611,332,316,8182,9948,29889,7747,29611,332,707,15390,316,544,2487,381,425,4323,2131,316,23734,3105,1973,316,425,363,11992,11076,29892,3503,1444,454,22300,30019,7293,270,29915,5474,1597,2684,29872,29889,2598,17889,2947,7848,316,425,8774,492,9386,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,2947,7199,9030,1354,301,29915,735,2488,553,3005,1144,818,425,8182,9948,363,11992,380,1908,29889,405,681,1671,30019,787,22572,29915,15669,439,29915,309,373,19947,4239,29889,28079,270,29915,24430,29892,425,363,11992,4875,29899,18202,29892,1559,7446,1026,454,7446,346,29892,7446,1026,634,503,538,325,609,7848,427,25732,654,966,1144,2535,966,10890,1671,301,29915,5753,2093,818,425,19703,5289,29889,1459,17488,29892,15093,4370,7890,4788,29920,818,425,715,482,634,712,14344,29899,455,707,694,381,316,9122,29892,7890,4788,29920,7848,427,25732,654,1671,1539,2484,26814,27299,2353,782,14419,309,29889,951,1473,2524,16269,25810,966,1801,1691,868,1874,882,10784,15819,29889,1720,409,3534,4664,296,610,454,18765,362,553,5694,1064,3698,634,610,1597,22964,918,316,301,29915,14531,26318,29889,830,854,787,1190,5278,715,482,29892,7890,29871,22730,610,854,29884,818,926,261,26814,27299,2353,782,14419,309,29889,4241,841,424,29892,980,5246,29871,29946,29906,867,743,634,7890,302,29915,1351,29920,2331,270,29915,14531,29889,20513,499,271,7890,2723,275,743,29889,1174,4951,29892,7890,7890,282,30037,22067,29889,838,943,29892,3440,4048,6390,1354,7015,4239,1374,1690,290,22702,1841,27493,19047,2123,1661,29892,425,8182,9948,316,425,363,11992,11076,29973,6803,18729,29892,4875,707,316,8774,386,356,5844,2249,15819,29889,2581,325,1759,938,27083,261,966,1801,1691,316,425,25732,654,634,13704,868,1874,882,29892,634,13704,868,1874,882,10784,15819,1465,454,1027,309,7289,29889,1174,16158,424,966,23876,29892,766,787,427,29871,29896,29929,29947,29900,29892,7847,427,2779,29884,424,18948,1224,454,3105,332,9291,29915,30001,22572,29
