{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-16T18:12:44.659926343Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I will analyze the voice active usage in the discourse. The questionnaire asks about the use of passive voice in the text, with options ranging from 0 (no passive voice) to 2 (excessive passive voice).\n\nAfter analyzing the text, I have identified several instances of passive voice usage. Here are my findings:\n\n1. The first sentence uses passive voice: \"Le travail c'est la santé.\" (The work is health.)\n2. The second sentence also uses passive voice: \"On va faire une expérience, prenez une grande inspiration.\" (We are going to conduct an experiment, take a big breath.)\n3. In the third sentence, the phrase \"inaller 100 000 particuliers\" (to inhale 100,000 people) uses passive voice.\n4. The fourth sentence starts with a passive construction: \"Je vais les laisser se présenter.\" (I am going to let them present themselves.)\n5. In the fifth sentence, the phrase \"tous les toxiques s'accrochent à moi\" (all toxins are attracted to me) uses passive voice.\n6. The sixth sentence starts with a passive construction: \"Mais arrêtez que vous soyez ultra-finompar.\" (But stop being ultra-fine.)\n7. In the seventh sentence, the phrase \"constituez un danger réel sur la santé respiratoire des chauffeurs de taxi\" (you constitute a real danger to the respiratory health of taxi drivers) uses passive voice.\n\nBased on these observations, I would score the use of passive voice in this transcript as follows:\n\nOption 1: Some passive voice for clarity/objectivity - 1\n\nThe text uses passive voice sparingly to enhance clarity and objectivity, particularly in the sentences mentioned above. However, the overall tone is more active and direct, which justifies the score of 1 for option 1.\n\nOption 2: A little bit of passive voice for clarté/l'objectivité - 2\n\nWhile the text does use some passive voice constructions, there are instances where the use of active voice could improve clarity and objectivity. For example, instead of \"tous les toxiques s'accrochent à moi,\" a more direct construction like \"toxins attach themselves to me\" could be used. Therefore, I would score option 2 as the most appropriate for this transcript.\n\nOption 3: A lot of passive voice - 2\n\nUnfortunately, the text uses excessive passive voice constructions, which can make it difficult to follow the author's train of thought and comprehend the main ideas. The frequent use of passive voice reduces the clarity and impact of the text, justifying a score of 2 for option 3.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis of the transcript provided, I would score the use of passive voice as follows: Option 2 - 2, indicating some instances of passive voice usage that could be improved by using more direct and active constructions to enhance clarity and
