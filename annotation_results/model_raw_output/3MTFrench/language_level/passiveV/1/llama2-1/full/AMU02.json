On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you rate the use of passive voice in this discourse?\n\nOption chosen: 1\n\nThe use of passive voice in this transcript is moderate, as it is used to provide clarity and objectivity in some instances. For example, in the sentence \"Les asteurs hittons léger, au contraire des grosses planètes, leur coeur ne s'est pas liquéfié préservant leur histoire,\" the use of passive voice helps to convey the idea that the asters and planets have different properties. However, in some instances, the use of passive voice can make the text less clear, as in the sentence \"Des fragments rapides, fris en la terre tombent un coup.\" Here, the use of passive voice makes it difficult to determine who or what is doing the falling.\n\nOverall, while the use of passive voice in this transcript is not excessive, it could be used more judiciously to improve clarity and readability.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,13861,1601,289,562,980,343,263,29871,29947,6063,29892,432,29915,1794,3060,10770,270,29915,4582,5561,1601,1302,5411,29889,4702,455,21394,29892,23872,29899,29885,13533,29889,2581,28078,11818,316,15470,437,312,5411,29889,435,29915,879,275,553,904,517,5475,1465,966,26809,634,553,9307,690,5644,262,966,564,4467,29899,8222,690,29889,12660,16627,5646,330,359,344,29892,432,29915,1794,4370,3151,13805,29892,553,286,7342,1973,1465,454,24850,694,381,29889,7455,711,5079,29991,435,29915,1794,28643,498,1489,2941,1750,19528,568,658,262,316,14255,8556,29889,11948,29202,29892,553,22370,14937,2247,29892,1424,275,427,425,18249,20450,296,443,17103,29889,360,29915,1466,927,1750,639,339,1082,454,899,29892,966,2298,11984,29892,29871,4277,282,17449,454,2148,1377,29889,11948,1465,5278,25875,316,288,791,29892,8556,4516,787,925,29872,286,29915,7342,29892,4029,568,29892,7455,711,5079,29991,951,25698,5000,1750,8556,297,17743,296,14255,7814,626,3783,10156,542,520,29879,29899,2460,1912,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,301,29915,355,15164,6722,980,20450,296,29892,3503,425,16864,3398,29879,1750,966,4760,296,29892,1354,1671,25497,276,818,425,1139,29892,980,8556,21668,1437,6737,805,271,4379,29892,29871,4277,5161,802,316,1302,30095,357,10814,10814,29892,6701,1354,274,29915,342,11387,3711,1725,29892,1424,275,1052,29889,7455,711,5079,29991,2664,263,1655,1295,298,986,787,22109,914,29892,782,6761,533,553,22683,267,3814,21158,29892,6267,1302,5411,452,269,29915,342,2331,15617,29948,7241,29948,7175,2140,424,6267,298,6844,29892,439,29915,265,5644,568,17256,3533,29875,3163,270,29915,812,2406,13933,29892,11797,3435,1791,743,4191,1597,946,354,332,29892,454,20536,7006,6003,681,1601,509,261,3440,269,29915,342,883,29948,454,21423,899,5218,29889,1720,707,8714,316,1539,2484,1190,1591,966,19966,575,712,611,266,17449,16193,29889,4785,29891,787,8689,1354,11797,3435,633,536,1849,2535,966,364,1355,712,432,29915,1794,286,29915,326,4220,29889,4250,2974,818,24286,332,316,26245,29892,2123,6079,8575,261,427,5644,262,508,5289,29892,2649,787,29899,29873,29899,309,8689,712,432,29915,1794,3060,10770,1671,343,8689,3711,381,1465,2257,289,9216,29899,442,29973,315,29915,342,1465,966,527,11259,553,4799,29879,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,658,262,316,12563,10551,362,29892,712,553,289,17718,868,21423,899,5218,1634,520,296,427,12563,766,4838,291,29889,27677,3778,359,2131,29892,6836,1236,457,29892,1597,10098,316,18948,316,611,521,5793,29892,432,29915,14056,558,355,427,611,10466,297,16063,9874,29892,1444,301,29915,1794,5758,295,29892,1444,301,29915,1794,285,945,5793,29889,323,283,14186,1465,1601,10212,20141,29892,1444,301,29915,1794,21308,275,29892,1444,301,29915,1794,766,681,29892,1444,2635,7209,9073,316,611,330,262,283,538,29892,425,521,1082,1190,18249,316,3999,274,737,433,1314,29889,2664,6896,19718,712,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,12388,358,2257,712,301,29915,265,1014,1082,29892,425,380,22462,311,707,289,2883,1341,1318,6879,603,316,25226,22888,639,29883,2667,29889,390,4196,818,534,8885,425,380,22462,311,1750,8556,285,504,2231,316,286,1924,22370,29889,9353,5278,3847,29948,6896,680,29892,425,6094,17449,316,301,29915,579,276,1320,273,29889,6803,534,8885,5278,977,11685,29892,301,29915,1540,553,8774,386,2631,712,1444,13942,29877,4798,707,301,29915,1893,1151,553,2181,30057,357,2600,13788,1190,443,904,12324,29872,260,1808,3966,459,29892,7171,711,5079,29889,997,3036,744,316,5278,298,6844,29892,1354,425,286,2249,14119,7890,5246,11482,1300,29892,274,29915,342,712,454,899,707,454,286,3350,381,553,16624,5908,634,1750,3435,5646,18916
