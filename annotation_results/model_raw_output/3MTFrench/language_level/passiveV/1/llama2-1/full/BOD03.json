The text often uses passive constructions to provide more information about the dance forms being discussed, such as \"Les bois se li√©es pour le bois\" or \"Les grieaux se sont les artistes.\" These passive constructions help to illustrate the different ways in which the dances are performed and the various roles involved.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Question 8 is: Option 1 - A little bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,30219,29874,9364,296,712,29871,29947,29900,29995,316,7814,623,7771,790,1179,3435,1871,2406,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,29892,427,316,29882,943,316,301,29915,29948,10936,29892,301,29915,328,663,29892,610,17488,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,425,23532,427,4880,424,443,20102,2535,26814,4595,29899,29886,1908,2123,10440,427,544,27153,443,9587,29889,838,11867,325,10281,29892,1444,7890,953,29885,8146,1465,29871,4277,2535,19601,29889,11948,2331,270,29915,5215,749,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,270,29915,5215,749,29889,2581,7890,16623,12278,1875,9291,29915,30001,22679,279,782,885,1690,2445,284,1671,343,623,29878,9030,425,6025,344,15296,279,29892,425,6025,344,316,425,285,9061,29892,425,6025,344,553,19452,553,7774,267,14938,7147,29889,422,1004,1444,26099,758,15008,316,6025,344,29892,274,29915,342,712,1444,592,26099,15935,5483,1671,14344,29899,455,29892,875,355,712,14954,1173,1509,427,8825,316,301,29915,29948,29392,29892,1444,592,26099,9667,29948,3440,707,29899,346,712,301,29915,265,15210,6025,344,332,634,6025,344,1509,316,15296,279,29889,478,29884,270,29915,1654,29892,980,7890,9378,277,316,7890,1663,699,276,1465,1597,904,10936,316,6025,344,29889,11948,18916,29899,6500,29892,980,302,29915,264,263,2331,29889,1174,5246,29892,302,29915,342,2331,1616,2488,1750,2453,329,29889,315,29915,342,1597,19513,316,4320,267,29889,5202,276,10098,29892,427,319,24361,316,4562,342,29892,966,1029,9502,267,269,30000,6609,409,16623,10978,610,11449,634,409,1301,2527,4904,316,6094,10500,427,6094,10500,29889,2664,23734,409,619,2406,1671,454,23734,29892,966,363,2710,4625,1671,454,9073,29892,301,29915,1893,8284,1295,1671,425,11196,545,29889,8748,966,867,347,2993,409,3435,966,7664,267,29889,11948,4883,2637,2034,575,4625,1841,29894,9509,712,316,2298,427,2298,316,6025,344,1295,452,3435,2331,5273,25802,1465,1597,11449,316,867,347,2993,29889,16932,4625,270,30095,623,29878,9030,29892,14857,358,29889,315,29915,342,2331,15237,6079,18679,610,966,11825,1750,14034,443,11510,631,19120,29948,1671,10713,21038,29889,8748,26154,610,346,712,966,867,347,2993,6919,296,443,364,1947,5264,2362,634,1437,791,272,8069,993,29889,3872,29883,19601,29892,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,454,13382,29892,1444,7890,29871,22730,818,443,1506,609,790,482,1871,295,29892,782,2757,316,425,11449,2225,802,639,24359,4191,443,1016,634,1841,29881,1524,818,1437,5404,2298,883,295,29892,782,2757,316,29868,634,316,6411,1759,29889,6803,18729,29892,432,29915,1794,623,3780,454,15296,279,316,26722,938,6270,18934,270,29915,12572,25179,26283,2535,454,6025,344,332,29889,435,29915,1794,5820,29948,316,20081,6411,1759,29889,435,29915,1794,5246,553,2637,2034,575,634,1444,26099,325,4814,443,11107,316,2301,1654,575,1465,966,5152,3302,316,15296,279,316,16014,29889,2664,21592,19503,29892,966,15182,1179,29892,4239,16283,4191,316,26245,29889,435,29915,1794,1634,609,29948,301,29915,28661,29892,980,269,29915,12478,11586,277,316,22679,279,427,10252,424,454,1487,634,301,29915,29948,768,1004,553,15296,1503,29889,350,999,29892,27962,316,425,16014,29889,319,425,20244,29892,2257,712,432,29915,932,1808,425,1301,3283,29892,274,29915,342,878,29792,12563,425,6025,344,29889,1174,2257,6351,9139,275,424,29892,454,15296,279,15210,4048,6390,29889,13377,275,29892,373,21714,270,29915,1540,6025,344,11382,29948,610,966,19452,1465,966,16014,553,7774,267,14173,533,29892,443,270,1237,4180,610,966,17137,1190,553,885,22702,316,6683,6436,6121,29889,1551,21714,270,29915,1540,6025,344,6722,966,19452,6025,344,707,4191,2257,455,29889,319,1597,6025,344,2298,3516,13816,634
