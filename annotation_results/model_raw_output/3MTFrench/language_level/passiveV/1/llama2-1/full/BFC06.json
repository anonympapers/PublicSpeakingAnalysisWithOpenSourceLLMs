My answers will be in the form of Option chosen: 0, 1, or 2.\n\nQuestion 8: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you assess the use of passive voice in the discourse of this transcription?\n\nOption chosen: 1 (A little bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity)\n\nThe transcript uses a mix of active and passive voice, with a slight lean towards passive voice. The use of passive voice helps to emphasize the communal nature of the event, such as the arrival of Simba's birth with the entire savannah community present. However, at times, the use of passive voice can make the text less clear, especially when the agent of the action is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I choose option 1, indicating a little bit of passive voice for clarity/objectivity.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29947,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,425,22759,1209,573,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,316,22759,1209,573,29889,29871,29896,353,853,7006,316,22759,1209,573,1671,425,1067,442,29948,29914,29880,29915,3318,440,2131,29889,29871,29906,353,4785,861,1209,573,19163,573,1750,7697,454,19696,371,7006,3711,381,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,17043,5582,29920,3058,882,553,269,4167,6836,286,3610,272,5481,575,634,425,8861,20244,29892,14344,316,425,1055,9948,316,3439,2291,2535,5278,22577,15188,904,1089,29887,275,424,868,11412,316,425,6316,29889,1588,1540,29920,7732,1473,267,19397,623,7367,5278,20244,29892,282,30037,344,301,29915,351,1171,22781,29892,454,14419,309,409,301,15792,29892,425,269,29915,485,663,263,18961,457,634,9411,966,3778,2993,316,425,269,29915,3496,276,564,374,794,316,5646,610,1671,1035,434,453,381,425,9367,868,13164,15927,29889,341,5093,966,10359,30037,5888,17508,375,3435,18916,1671,409,883,333,519,634,6003,375,29889,4241,841,424,1444,7890,16193,1597,18768,1873,29889,1954,22094,29920,29892,2257,6701,17541,2093,3435,9411,966,3778,2993,316,425,4048,11276,634,7209,1153,7241,6578,1671,938,27083,261,3439,2291,818,425,28812,2535,1027,2037,29442,19874,29874,634,872,1153,10993,966,11825,316,3439,2291,29889,838,943,15237,5695,6079,1577,10050,29892,373,707,270,29915,5753,536,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,712,425,29580,371,21865,1572,868,12536,424,818,8121,261,443,17889,1465,454,3060,861,316,1601,29140,316,266,17449,29892,1444,325,1759,16134,424,7890,425,5814,5893,29889,422,1004,373,454,24722,1465,425,29580,371,316,425,5273,9948,316,3439,2291,29892,316,6003,381,11825,634,818,2723,453,1908,443,289,10126,29948,707,443,10019,1690,882,3817,1300,5218,29889,323,681,966,18490,316,425,28812,3435,7602,542,2406,29889,997,11449,29892,966,626,275,3503,5695,8648,966,29758,1144,29889,838,943,8556,5820,787,8997,316,872,18097,6701,270,29915,18704,712,301,29915,5903,1690,882,316,425,5273,9948,707,21617,29884,316,24145,19513,17543,744,443,10019,1690,882,4348,2491,782,1791,21867,782,7303,29889,2664,22114,11825,316,2257,3435,316,610,13258,275,452,2453,352,296,2331,316,15470,4595,29899,862,1237,29889,1459,16132,11797,3435,904,417,647,743,10505,1946,8105,882,316,10713,21038,29889,2664,1153,14125,3435,2473,2701,634,760,275,1354,20423,7848,712,966,29026,11825,409,5663,283,794,20536,1671,316,15470,11825,818,2723,453,1908,634,23532,1487,7431,2310,475,316,6267,289,10126,29948,29889,422,1004,1465,1597,266,17449,29892,373,452,8164,2331,5646,9073,29892,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,263,4370,1437,4387,29948,966,1801,1691,868,11482,1300,316,13267,819,1832,616,1190,454,316,15470,21428,29889,1281,4838,882,29892,439,1379,1801,1691,343,1078,269,29915,309,1190,966,29026,21428,7628,339,29915,1808,302,29915,342,2331,2793,1190,966,18490,316,6267,11449,427,316,29882,943,316,6267,378,12090,29892,7628,339,29915,1808,2906,7081,21428,29889,6803,269,29915,264,904,2608,29948,9073,29892,1444,592,26099,26842,404,29948,818,301,29915,29948,4068,316,6267,2852,481,347,11643,1387,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,29892,818,6267,19666,316,1437,2590,634,270,29915,264,5389,7342,782,9587,868,8714,634,8648,818,301,29915,29948,4068,316,425,4021,2131,553,5302,29889,1281,29926,688,744,29892,3847,284,634,1832,616,29889,9353,5278,1203,361,29892,1444,26099,599,29948,782,2432,25123,316,29871,29941,29945,29026,11825,29892,553,4832,3031,13116,782,29871,29896,29900,2123,11387,316,6267,289,10126,29948,29889,435,29915,1794,1757,29948,553,9953,2406,270,29915,264,17124,6609,29892,16623,2331,7015,5155,1056,2658,634,12036,261,553,5697,1169,12298,270,29915,1639,2467,1832,616,29889,435,29915,1794,443,269,29915,29891,3708,24984,29871,29906,29945,29900,1998,3246,818,2432,25123,29889,6803,9073,18475,441,381,966,12694,2063,29892,432,29915,1794,8572,29948,1601,904,13775,12794,316,29871,29941,29945,29026,21428,427,316,11107,29889,2664,286,5
