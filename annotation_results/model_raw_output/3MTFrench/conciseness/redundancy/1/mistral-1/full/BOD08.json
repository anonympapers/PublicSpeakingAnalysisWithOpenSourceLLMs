In this explanation, I will do my best to translate and clarify your description for those unfamiliar with the topic.\n\nYou're in a lab, at home, in high school, and instead of the usual chalkboards used by chemistry teachers, you've heard about Valorrec, a company developing tubes for exploiting oil reserves underwater. Montenegro students are also collaborating on a similar problem. You're part of the tubing industry, creating tubes to extract oil from beneath the seafloor. The oleodynamic engineers avoid brittleness through the use of hydrogen. Now, let's follow our guide, GCR, and imagine we are in this situation. In this context, you see a barrier layer. I compress it with electrons to force hydrogen atoms to form clusters. Picture yourself as if you were a tiny atom, interacting at the same scale as these clusters. Our guide will explain:\n\nIn this scenario, we encounter a porous layer. I squeeze it with electrons (GXG). Forcing hydrogen atoms to aggregate is like this. You see in the barrier layer, hydrogen atoms nicely packed together, and the hydrogene itself seems to be swirling like oil in water. But pay attention: there's a majority of hydrogen atoms here, along with some heavier atoms like helium. And there are trace amounts of other elements such as nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide. Look closely; the hydrogen atoms cluster around these impurities or contaminants, which I refer to as contaminant gases. You'll also notice that the hydrogene seems to be moving between these clusters. Let's follow it, it moves to a second room:\n\nHere, we're still in the barrier layer but have moved from one side of it. It has a higher concentration of hydrogen atoms compared to the previous area, as you may have noticed. It also contains some helium and other heavier contaminant gases. However, let's focus on the hydrogen atoms, which are more abundant. They move around and interact with the contaminant gases and impurities like methane, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Pay attention: you might see a group of hydrogen atoms gathering around methane molecules. This is where things get interesting:\n\nIn this room, I've designed a machine to draw out the gas. Notice how these hydrogen atoms separate into distinct layers with applied force from the machine. The gas becomes more fragile as it separates. The mechanism by which the hydrogen gas becomes so brittle is not well understood and is an active area of research. But that's why I brought you here, to observe:\n\nLook closely at these hydrogen atoms, they seem to be gathering near a small crack or fissure. You might want to prepare your beaker for the experiment, especially if you plan on extracting the gas. Ah, but remember, not all hydrogen atoms are created equal! Here, we encounter two types of hydrogen: normal (protium) and heavy isotopes (deuterium and tritium). The heavy isotopes tend to be attracted to the contaminants or impurities more strongly.
