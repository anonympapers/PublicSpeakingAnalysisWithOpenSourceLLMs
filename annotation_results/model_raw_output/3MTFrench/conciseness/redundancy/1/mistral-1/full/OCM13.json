For instance, the speaker mentions that \"One person out of seven in the world traveled around the planet\" and later on states that \"300 millions of individuals reached the middle class.\" These statements convey similar information but are expressed differently, ensuring the audience understands the key points being made. Additionally, the speaker emphasizes the importance of providing references or markers for tourists, repeating the phrase \"What about our tourists?\" and stating that \"Mataise is progressive\" to drive home the main message of his presentation. Overall, the redundancy in the transcription helps clarify complex ideas and ensure that the audience fully understands the speaker's intentions.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,27554,457,543,1203,2342,340,543,2034,19438,949,17969,2422,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,28723,15540,3670,15349,8821,10148,331,28725,5039,28764,462,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,481,23473,634,4224,1415,1415,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,15540,27424,2996,16906,14257,28764,14956,2877,714,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,28725,28705,28750,4346,634,439,12909,1147,3670,955,18880,3639,8821,3551,2422,9886,28733,3007,28406,1702,28735,28723,550,607,435,340,20650,2183,278,361,526,28742,1802,427,1390,340,11844,2877,911,949,1079,543,3264,1405,9886,543,19396,29000,28747,5425,2183,278,412,28747,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,3466,28705,28750,28745,15417,766,450,28764,5672,4224,2422,305,28742,556,267,11109,28705,8668,5248,448,2422,462,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,4709,28824,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,12303,24994,28705,28774,28723,330,10454,267,1182,278,28725,1147,2219,1233,631,20703,340,28705,28734,1289,28705,28750,28725,12971,934,462,340,820,28797,340,2760,1089,617,1415,679,4265,1415,2312,2020,2422,8821,1203,2342,1550,18180,28735,28747,11109,28705,28734,327,12184,340,2760,1089,617,28723,28705,28740,327,935,12631,340,2760,1089,617,2669,3285,340,533,444,28797,28723,28705,28750,327,3690,1089,617,24213,1415,679,4265,28748,2279,290,1649,3025,6884,462,22309,424,17775,533,992,28745,28793,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,451,8884,1514,484,2728,411,1415,7113,10425,28723,689,13768,2232,2110,28725,1521,5097,28723,13542,277,28742,374,15053,9628,28723,2678,27655,28764,481,28705,28750,28734,28740,28787,28723,16035,1338,485,1147,28705,28787,2422,462,15004,264,15545,357,28797,1206,423,340,543,2623,21056,28723,28705,29215,28708,13212,363,1228,955,305,28742,28762,28619,8768,934,543,28705,28781,28706,23227,340,4843,2669,543,5006,28737,634,7113,15099,1233,434,10568,28723,13542,28705,2650,28725,462,7113,10425,28725,277,28742,374,521,877,2345,412,1147,28705,28740,28734,28723,28705,29215,28708,13212,363,1228,955,305,28742,370,2306,28707,416,5082,340,1776,361,28705,10456,427,462,20351,19802,9078,438,424,501,340,26708,340,28705,28770,28734,28734,11076,281,28742,507,2397,381,28723,550,607,16906,6884,5620,24380,28705,28770,28734,28734,11076,28725,277,28742,374,28300,15396,543,4889,21801,28723,13542,9628,3418,28710,28725,2218,519,278,4221,426,7340,955,305,28742,28762,28619,8768,264,16065,1514,1289,8466,2669,6737,281,1238,8821,24303,3698,24265,28723,976,734,7705,28764,28723,19479,791,872,431,6702,462,307,28906,4110,12122,15349,2669,6737,281,1238,28804,334,28742,374,19341,7113,6508,28723,550,607,28725,27462,16906,28486,465,28764,28733,28728,607,14257,28764,634,1558,9603,28804,13542,9628,3418,28710,28725,2218,284,1058,955,1514,7113,15099,1176,722,11631,28725,356,3432,2448,340,1558,9603,28723,13542,277,28742,374,26941,955,461,28742,1585,8582,8052,634,7151,28723,351,563,864,3466,3670,7249,267,1147,16065,1514,575,4544,3025,14632,434,677,281,28742,4373,441,425,361,28725,312,1210,361,911,15349,15283,361,11844,16421,4601,7113,15099,28723,2332,3222,1759,381,1424,4110,481,1633,28804,2332,8668,14983,28725,526,1190,9804,28804,13542,2669,364,3950,3557,2219,24303,1829,1011,28804,550,607,305,28742,458,28764,25093,28804,351,563,864,934,430,886,4970,1197,28723,4926,2868,412,28725,7165,296,28725,1829,1011,28733,322,28733,288,28725,14128,7851,28725,8821,26590,631,14055,485,8466,462,15004,940,358,526,28742,3222,28725,940,358,955,8466,462,15004,934,5475,2741,28797,2422,3670,28146,28723,1343,26708,3466,340,1448,262,28725,8821,26590,631,934,2278,28723,976,734,28725,2218,284,1058,955,10404,7113,15099,1176,12306,28725,356,3432,2448,28725,526,28742,266,427,277,4276,340,1101,1337,287,848,335,340,1326,28541,934,340,285,4652,3160,263,1514,7944,4511,2208,677,1442,28723,14527,305,28742,28716,14924,301,28733,28754,309,28725,543,1846,28708,2394,28725,1514,7363,23254,4030,28725,911,10274,16906,28725,2144,8582,390,337,521,28725,2422,363,385,6768,28723,976,734,28725,277,28742,374,363,27097,28725,1521,337,264,5465,28725,277,28742,374,7944,28723,2661,337,264,462,1326,4545,294,2805,334,28733,28762,28725,1521,337,264,305,28742,28716,14924,301,340,4843,28725,5359,268,1344,28764,955,317,1554,28725,19255,5497,481,5835,340,3201,1116,481,11450,263,462,11853,28797,1176,1375,28723,976,734,28725,461,28742,14043,3228,28725,461,28742,14043,3228,28725,5359,281,28742,314,4854,815,22320,28725,955,16906,5271,5219,416,11223,340,3670,2470,28723,475,28742,14043,3228,955,3670,2470,26050,462,1101,935,2470,2278,28725,7944,16906,28723,13542,461,28742,14043,3228,955,11989,1011,16906,6419,11693,263,28797,634,3884,15099,934,467,602,1442,2422,459,267,26372,536,28725,16906,16906,791,311,1097,28764,28725,16906,28725,1147,3670,955,16906,8631,20650,15349,28725,2669,15216,1554,1514,932,441,425,361,28723,4709,733,28748,16289,28793,7664,2183,278,412,28747,28705,28740,28745,415,1203,2342,5876,741,6153,302,3230,292,5403,298,5407,25312,354,272,7938,28723,1263,3335,28725,272,17153,4498,594,369,345,6167,1
