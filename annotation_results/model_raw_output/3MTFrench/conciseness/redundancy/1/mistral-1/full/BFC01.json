She explains that while CPR is crucial for survival, its effectiveness is limited, with only a 5% success rate in France. To address this issue, Dr. Marie has embarked on a mission to develop an intelligent ventilation system for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) teams.\n\nBody:\nGeorge is a charismatic and handsome man, but he and I share more than just good looks. We both work in Croix at the Café, and we both save lives – he on TV, and I as a doctor and urgentist in the field with my samu bag. Besides treating patients, I conduct research, focusing on cardiac arrest care and the Recrediac project, which receives 70,000 donations annually to fund this vital cause. Unfortunately, survival rates have not improved significantly over the last 20 years, making it essential to optimize CPR techniques.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to perform cardiac massage and oxygenate patients. While I can do a cardiac massage, ventilating effectively is more complicated. Many people may think that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is the answer, but it's not enough. Instead, we use bags with masks and provide oxygen from tanks. George and his team perform this on TV, but in reality, EMS teams lack the tools to assess the effectiveness of this ventilation method. We don't know how much air we're supplying to the patient or if there are leaks in the mask.\n\nSo, I thought long and hard about finding a solution for more efficient ventilation. Between coffees at the Café, I began to consider designing a smart system that guides us during this process, informing us when and how much air to provide, as well as assessing the patient's needs. With the help of engineering students and later biomedical engineers, we conceived and developed such a device.\n\nEuropean regulations require rigorous testing for any medical devices, so our prototypes underwent thorough evaluation by a group of firefighter doctors. They tested the devices on mannequins, reporting significant improvements in ventilation efficacy – over 70% more effective than before. Now, we must bring this technology to the next level, integrating it with defibrillators, and make it accessible to all EMS teams across Europe.\n\nSo what can you do? Support our efforts to bring this intelligent ventilation system into the field and help us save even more lives – just like
