They explain that they are part of a group of observers and consultants, and that their goal is to help teachers and students develop new skills and competencies. The speaker then provides some background information about the current state of higher education, including the pressure to adapt to changing societal needs and the challenges faced by students in finding employment after graduation. They also mention their research hypothesis, which involves creating collectives of teachers and students to work together towards a common goal.\n\nUse of History:\nThe speaker uses history in several ways throughout the speech. Firstly, they mention that they have been working on their thesis for two years, which shows that they have invested time and effort into their research. Secondly, they reference the idea that history repeats itself, which suggests that there are patterns in human behavior that can be observed across different time periods. Finally, the speaker talks about the importance of understanding the context of historical events in order to learn from them and avoid repeating mistakes.\n\nOptions:\nBased on the transcript provided, I would choose option 2: \"Utilisation pertinente de l'histoire\".
