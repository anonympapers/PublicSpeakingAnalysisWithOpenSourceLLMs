The speaker uses historical context to explain the evolution of the problem and how it has become a major issue in today's society. The use of the term \"fléau\" (curse) to describe traffic congestion highlights the severity of the problem, and the speaker's proposal for a solution is well-reasoned and well-supported by scientific evidence.\n\nThe speech also uses effective rhetorical devices, such as repetition and parallelism, to emphasize key points and make the message more impactful. For example, the speaker repeats the phrase \"Bouteilleage c'est insupportable\" (Traffic congestion is unbearable) several times throughout the speech to drive home the point that traffic congestion is a major problem. Similarly, the use of parallelism in the sentence \"Des mon devantes, des mon deux têtes, ils peuvent même causer la mort\" (Some monkeys have two heads, and they can even cause death) creates a sense of urgency and highlights the potential consequences of not addressing the traffic congestion problem.\n\nOverall, the narration in the speech is well-structured and effective in conveying the speaker's message. The use of historical context and rhetorical devices helps to make the speech more engaging and persuasive, and the proposal for a solution is well-reasoned and supported by scientific evidence. Therefore, I choose Option 2 - Utilization pertinente de l'histoire.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,350,2663,1924,482,274,29915,342,1663,29884,3016,519,29892,443,3345,12213,2488,639,276,29871,29929,29900,26893,427,28504,316,872,6316,610,385,818,4556,553,289,3222,787,29889,951,12491,26814,1667,29892,1354,7890,3669,2350,568,29920,325,336,2073,11469,1597,1650,17667,818,2257,1652,29948,585,29889,5670,29892,425,289,7293,15217,29892,274,29915,342,712,432,29915,1794,20737,844,3977,29948,818,301,6463,8474,966,7232,2663,7545,19406,2710,29889,10050,2331,2257,712,503,29948,862,793,634,325,3698,29892,3503,28185,9373,2257,712,503,29948,862,793,13149,2540,16053,479,29889,7747,455,707,1597,4439,328,347,868,13625,16794,1318,1248,4790,280,8645,29875,316,11757,1759,267,29889,9353,454,1601,1248,4790,280,8645,29875,29892,15680,345,316,2970,10741,7779,2127,352,275,6198,818,13149,1297,29889,1174,2257,1750,378,2265,484,454,1601,11757,1759,267,29892,321,29882,6079,274,29915,342,301,29915,265,427,868,25974,262,1750,263,4224,23048,5278,4439,328,347,29889,2043,4790,280,8645,29875,316,11757,1759,267,29889,951,25698,5000,1465,5278,4439,328,347,707,427,11482,1300,29892,782,19666,316,301,29915,375,457,29892,425,286,3498,1509,1509,29892,1750,24108,818,1391,533,553,13149,2540,16053,479,270,29915,1540,2258,15529,19163,573,634,297,329,488,29889,997,18342,362,1750,6303,20501,680,29892,316,3516,21642,29892,1002,545,29920,29892,8296,449,16895,29948,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,425,6635,579,1336,354,29889,1720,19947,443,3058,1020,17334,1671,5278,4439,328,347,29892,16794,29948,301,29915,1639,571,265,29892,3503,980,452,652,8356,712,29871,29906,29900,29995,553,22069,29889,951,15744,316,611,266,17449,707,316,534,8885,443,2730,11771,1671,626,15817,9386,301,29915,29948,2416,562,2131,316,409,10283,293,1166,1671,19397,946,29875,12416,9411,966,22069,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,3667,895,301,29915,1639,571,265,427,6701,8714,712,301,29915,1433,1100,1387,29889,951,14100,553,772,14125,29892,3503,24108,818,443,27908,29892,4191,707,6309,439,29915,30001,19601,29889,1174,20744,29892,301,29915,1433,1100,1387,263,4370,904,6092,454,14100,553,772,14125,818,4556,316,9411,966,1801,1691,302,2445,271,10270,439,29915,309,8164,3269,261,29889,2726,1601,2906,3794,29892,553,1601,4239,260,22730,29892,11797,8164,6701,3269,261,425,5758,29889,1720,263,5695,4370,27257,11728,425,282,2736,276,316,25997,12990,1654,271,7081,8115,29892,1559,980,263,1035,3610,16555,301,29915,5753,2093,818,443,22500,768,482,29889,3792,20792,5278,286,585,1564,895,2225,344,29892,980,8164,12220,13639,7847,301,29915,27083,5949,634,966,521,12387,29892,301,29915,265,3667,895,1671,1020,1524,10741,4439,328,583,4191,454,23900,29889,997,8861,8691,270,29915,14531,1601,15744,263,3635,275,316,1601,509,261,712,454,1020,17334,553,269,473,275,1750,3669,600,7771,316,425,11398,316,301,29915,29923,29894,562,559,2535,301,29915,1639,571,265,427,6701,8714,29892,712,301,29915,1433,1100,1387,707,21394,2298,6366,815,712,454,1020,17334,2535,301,29915,1639,571,265,20536,29889,461,432,29915,1794,2653,1601,509,261,29871,4277,29973,2581,544,1975,443,7006,316,4771,1190,18402,439,29915,1540,553,269,473,275,14984,966,3031,13116,13180,425,1411,1318,868,1020,17334,29889,2581,16623,2331,7015,409,3435,1465,1597,4933,1750,592,14924,270,29915,29948,791,2853,301,29915,348,316,301,29915,14531,13149,1297,16053,479,29889,751,392,1487,5419,3964,14150,2123,18097,980,6664,993,818,425,6056,744,29892,1444,4880,275,454,25698,5000,634,5695,6367,1358,782,19666,316,301,29915,375,457,29889,6803,7848,269,30095,29878,712,14984,966,269,473,275,3435,2025,6311,1410,1064,743,29889,422,1004,29871,4277,29892,11387,316,13149,2540,16053,479,29892,11387,316,289,3222,1934,63
