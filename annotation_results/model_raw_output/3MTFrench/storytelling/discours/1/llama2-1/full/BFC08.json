{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-13T22:17:57.168668317Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, here is my analysis of the narration in the speech:\n\nAccording to the questionnaire, the speaker has been tasked with analyzing a public transcription and evaluating the narrative structure of the text. The questions in the questionnaire guide the analysis, and for each question, there are three options (0, 1, or 2) with explanations on what each option represents.\n\nFor the first question, \"Selon vous, sur une échelle de 0 à 2, évaluez-vous la narration dans le discours de cette transcription ?\", I would choose option 2: Utilisation pertinente de l'histoire. The speaker uses the history of the company and its employees to illustrate the importance of intelligence artificial in improving their competitiveness and contributing to the industry 4.0. The narrative structure is well-organized, and the speaker uses a clear and concise language to convey their message.\n\nThe speech is structured into several sections, each addressing a specific topic related to the use of artificial intelligence in the company. The speaker uses a logical flow of ideas, connecting each point to the previous one and building a coherent narrative. They also use rhetorical questions and repetition to emphasize their points and keep the listener engaged.\n\nThe speaker's tone is confident and persuasive, and they use a conversational style to make the audience feel comfortable and involved in the conversation. The use of colloquial expressions and slang words (e.g., \"coder,\" \"donnie,\" \"piemme\") adds a personal touch and helps to convey the speaker's personality and experience.\n\nOverall, the narration in the speech is effective in conveying the speaker's message and persuading the audience of the importance of artificial intelligence in the company.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8407,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29892,980,6303,1424,29948,16011,316,5663,8885,443,508,1306,782,6299,270,29915,6727,335,1372,316,1373,6718,29889,438,1481,29892,432,29915,1794,6309,6079,443,508,1306,29889,10043,1671,626,1792,966,1375,2361,2535,3999,521,550,787,29892,3503,28185,9373,1671,966,410,6772,914,8474,1597,964,27375,362,29889,1174,5246,29892,1014,277,29899,29873,29899,309,3479,3479,26943,634,534,743,787,29899,455,7586,3479,904,29885,6847,553,12642,304,29916,3783,29892,9301,818,1437,371,312,261,1671,966,6063,29889,951,508,1306,269,29915,342,1147,29875,12866,4191,443,714,309,868,1437,29467,16784,1071,553,270,549,743,29889,5345,29948,911,707,1465,454,6701,378,29149,712,301,29915,1062,13857,7903,332,29892,269,4987,439,29915,309,269,29915,23121,2331,270,29915,1540,7903,316,1373,6718,29892,3503,270,29915,1540,7903,316,1016,2786,29889,8748,1601,17889,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,1062,29878,1908,316,425,17043,9948,818,8019,316,7015,14735,743,29892,373,3667,895,427,553,13698,29892,553,21082,19069,28119,29892,18934,316,9484,261,553,508,1306,4610,29884,4999,1671,544,566,381,425,11482,8837,868,21423,634,8288,3367,1875,10042,6267,7132,654,29889,341,13533,316,1016,2786,707,301,29915,14056,7734,274,6119,29892,1750,707,1597,2930,331,1004,2601,1318,1465,454,4662,29916,634,23662,15826,1465,425,18187,362,553,2930,17893,3345,12213,316,14857,16784,2459,29889,365,29915,370,271,29892,1444,6427,8284,2535,301,29915,24031,553,15001,1379,29892,13214,12255,29892,454,5544,519,25413,29892,2535,269,29915,12478,283,346,10767,29884,29892,1487,13137,316,6013,634,966,4191,21394,316,1487,25740,29889,1720,452,26939,2331,301,29915,524,1064,11992,316,1601,18848,29892,6701,980,282,1947,439,29915,309,707,297,329,488,29889,11948,610,8116,309,29892,980,11465,403,2535,19601,29889,1174,5246,29892,12255,707,443,14738,270,29915,4548,4894,663,29892,980,17043,277,5646,818,9551,316,7015,14884,29892,3503,18679,439,29915,265,707,1437,643,509,1481,882,634,24145,325,3246,344,868,3408,634,4046,1318,29892,12255,302,29915,279,4401,2331,818,15882,15237,634,25595,358,454,619,264,2637,301,29915,293,852,634,454,1136,29948,3910,270,29915,1540,282,30057,484,29889,306,455,18916,29892,2123,623,2518,13871,301,29915,5215,749,316,301,29915,524,28286,19069,11381,29892,1750,8164,1020,1524,2298,25595,358,634,2298,875,20564,2257,712,8556,4048,787,20737,29892,427,7483,21603,24145,1518,4894,663,29889,435,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,10042,316,6282,1089,4883,3093,3751,4467,29892,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,611,266,17449,610,2852,566,347,301,29915,2487,3409,29948,26318,29892,1750,378,2265,484,301,29915,16211,347,712,316,18165,17239,270,29915,6727,2945,29889,6101,21880,3435,16805,944,29892,373,2432,1875,1661,13499,262,2016,29892,1601,16731,29892,15382,898,1647,29892,2123,6701,867,2593,265,1089,1190,553,282,2754,414,29889,2598,1203,361,634,868,13436,11728,269,29915,342,27282,29892,626,15817,9386,301,29915,18721,1052,537,634,553,4511,743,818,8774,3068,1306,29892,18934,316,7199,9030,454,20299,882,270,29915,6727,2945,634,10273,2249,436,295,818,6628,1314,966,330,1064,743,29889,365,29915,264,1324,29884,9638,22781,270,29915,290,1131,749,707,316,7697,276,553,451,1080,4280,267,29892,13547,712,7997,3630,21082,19069,11381,29892,1203,309,29892,15579,1671,1597,282,1974,29872,4191,2522,18309,29892,18934,316,4325,1454,2265,872,752,277,440,2131,634,425,1539,2484,1190,301,29915,279,374,316,301,29915,20041,2546,29871,29896,29946,29889,29900,29889,1720,343,263,443,325,17016,15725,3165,475,29892,13704,316,7602,475,1037,12255,306,368,14254,29892,712,301,29915,524,28286,19069,11381,302,29915,29891,2331,18916,1671,966,1539
