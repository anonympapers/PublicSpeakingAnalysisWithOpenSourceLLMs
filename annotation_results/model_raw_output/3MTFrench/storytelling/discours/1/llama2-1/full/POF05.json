The speaker provides historical context to support their argument that the presence of Americans in Polynesia was significant and influential. They mention specific dates and events, such as the arrival of David Porter's fleet in 1813, and provide evidence from archives and gravures to support their claims. The narration is clear and well-structured, making it easy to follow and understand the speaker's argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,30219,29874,325,1249,7890,712,29871,29929,29929,29995,316,7814,28074,1314,427,432,29915,1794,22572,29915,15669,3435,1053,743,316,7599,347,29892,3503,29871,4277,325,1249,7890,26154,439,29915,309,343,263,29871,29896,29945,29900,6063,634,13180,16573,270,29915,348,23690,29899,1039,5949,29892,274,29915,342,18916,7599,347,1750,1053,1249,3999,28074,1314,316,9913,29552,29889,8748,2257,455,302,29915,342,712,301,29915,348,553,25226,11875,2701,1750,1559,16027,895,29892,5278,8220,17153,260,1249,819,1354,7006,11009,434,29889,2581,16623,1597,1243,1190,966,14127,2708,782,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29892,818,9913,29552,1465,966,2961,793,316,301,29915,627,2491,2043,948,267,347,11076,29889,8748,18484,966,29869,270,29915,13624,2043,948,267,7081,1104,30057,16011,425,17055,2131,11020,711,768,273,1387,782,29140,316,9913,29552,29889,11948,2123,29890,1593,425,29845,553,14127,2708,782,6701,3256,29889,1913,9989,475,1750,6787,277,5646,316,6701,5646,782,1472,868,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29892,425,2428,2653,9948,439,29915,309,409,364,2016,782,29871,29906,29900,29872,8115,29889,8748,274,29915,342,12866,18916,712,432,29915,1639,29894,993,29889,2581,3669,2350,568,13942,29877,2496,301,29915,333,1318,270,29915,1540,2961,280,316,9913,29552,29892,432,29915,328,895,2225,802,28763,29889,2664,5278,8220,17818,344,2637,966,14127,2708,634,966,2043,948,267,819,29892,302,29915,609,8265,3433,610,966,1352,6899,1750,17161,296,26154,782,286,2249,14119,425,4889,316,301,29915,13453,29884,663,29409,267,1465,5278,2961,280,29889,2598,18848,316,23520,1190,966,3190,3145,553,282,12332,818,2011,316,8861,6896,499,271,29889,2664,23094,446,267,29892,4191,373,966,2245,655,277,818,301,29915,25165,29892,15777,20081,1465,966,17256,3190,666,1379,316,301,29915,627,2491,2043,948,267,347,11076,29889,8748,7015,2961,793,15777,14127,13116,10042,270,29915,5474,11076,29889,10050,2331,1597,8104,347,28763,29892,6701,1354,427,29871,29896,29947,29896,29941,29892,454,2085,1004,270,29915,272,4699,7102,357,29892,385,484,9100,7814,1302,29899,29882,2147,29889,897,872,26138,14511,1230,29892,7209,301,29915,5753,536,316,7660,29892,1750,452,13267,29875,25404,2331,1487,1044,29872,29889,8748,7890,992,4099,29920,29871,1654,29892,301,29915,1540,553,409,7273,8310,1973,553,282,12332,29892,6722,301,29915,265,24722,443,7482,412,585,17153,29892,8024,29948,1190,454,20536,1766,7680,819,29889,11948,28185,9373,1597,9949,28763,634,443,10879,5162,10042,454,3279,10407,271,634,301,29915,273,3559,610,966,1352,6899,29889,897,2298,29892,966,289,2520,2406,634,10890,6283,2658,14127,2708,15777,19445,316,29871,29896,29900,10098,2298,20081,712,966,6283,2658,553,10890,19079,1465,454,2011,316,3500,631,29899,29873,29899,300,29899,300,2637,29871,29896,29947,29941,29946,634,29871,29896,29947,29945,29946,29889,1174,29871,29896,29947,29946,29945,29892,29871,29896,29929,289,2520,2406,285,3722,13546,2257,439,29915,30001,425,3500,631,29899,29873,29899,300,29899,300,29889,1459,2460,23778,29892,3041,661,6899,29892,297,574,11818,634,9411,966,10890,15777,14127,2708,29889,997,405,404,3121,29899,29963,2016,29892,11062,30085,29873,533,2414,29894,1249,4239,289,2520,2406,7691,29892,1399,336,11728,619,264,634,29871,29896,29896,29892,634,2123,29875,29892,29871,29896,29896,289,2520,2406,14127,2708,29889,1551,14034,8532,301,29915,6574,627,23837,1387,29892,3503,26154,5264,316,5278,29845,29889,1174,10890,29892,966,325,574,3610,275,800,14127,13116,316,11062,30085,28898,634,553,2961,793,1048,4285,818,425,1436,868,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,443,10359,6617,2600,898,316,7732,4931,1080,270,29915,17234,28763,1750,4079,316,23563,1248,9012,1475,10440,22572,29915,1566
