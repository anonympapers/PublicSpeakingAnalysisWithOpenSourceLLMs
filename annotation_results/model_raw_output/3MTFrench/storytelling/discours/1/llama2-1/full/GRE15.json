The speaker uses metaphors and analogies to explain their perception of the natural phenomena they observe, such as comparing the stars to a musical composition or the weather to a complex machine. Throughout the transcript, the speaker engages in a stream of consciousness-like monologue, reflecting on their experiences and observations in a poetic and imaginative manner. The narration is present throughout the discourse, with the speaker's thoughts and feelings being intertwined with their descriptions of the natural world. Therefore, I choose option 2 - Utilization pertinente de l'histoire, as the narration is an integral part of the speaker's reflection and appreciation of the natural world.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,29871,1654,29892,373,544,264,1249,454,8714,29892,270,29915,2749,30037,357,316,3581,12416,634,316,409,926,261,29889,897,4880,261,454,9122,26269,316,577,29875,707,7336,381,29948,29889,2664,904,517,5475,29892,610,17488,29892,454,8714,270,29915,1540,26436,26245,270,29915,7342,29889,1551,14111,443,325,17016,263,680,316,26957,521,15806,29889,2726,904,517,5475,439,29915,265,302,29915,23071,2331,18679,9291,29915,30001,301,29915,28661,29889,1551,269,29915,7202,346,9359,439,29915,1808,269,29915,6388,895,427,7945,29892,5898,13618,316,1040,514,362,29889,8748,373,409,14953,424,443,7006,29892,373,1671,8356,6701,966,875,355,690,29889,1704,18402,8717,276,18836,484,29892,818,425,26722,270,29915,1540,17184,1173,29892,634,263,4193,553,18025,1750,3911,3435,26138,29892,427,904,13147,424,6079,29889,1551,875,355,8356,454,14419,309,29892,432,29915,29882,6430,5388,634,966,10890,29892,8556,8121,743,553,269,29915,7192,265,1240,575,875,631,29889,12390,286,3610,283,2218,3435,619,743,818,2257,439,29915,309,269,29915,342,1209,29948,29889,10016,4443,1465,425,8877,29892,3928,818,443,1374,1690,290,8146,1465,301,29915,29948,517,488,2123,425,3814,12973,29889,1174,13219,7661,29892,1354,818,18402,14426,29892,1444,872,275,2257,712,1444,7890,521,562,484,443,553,23643,316,1601,22624,15679,29892,1444,1671,23469,623,5606,13241,2684,882,425,5694,19113,29892,301,29915,326,2590,29889,1720,427,409,425,29403,1190,2543,5388,29892,425,286,7342,29877,427,5246,29889,11948,7890,454,4078,29920,29892,4191,19601,29892,425,286,7342,29877,29892,274,29915,342,2331,15237,9577,5713,519,29889,6803,7848,269,30095,29878,553,7019,558,575,270,29915,735,455,1237,29892,454,26713,2730,11771,29892,274,29915,342,10440,270,29915,12572,325,1064,3709,29889,11948,818,301,29915,1466,29892,402,1617,1056,29892,1671,8689,1354,454,2298,29892,274,29915,342,16623,519,29889,838,11867,1190,2543,5388,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,2298,752,492,17851,29889,315,29915,342,443,1513,712,274,29915,342,9301,29892,439,29915,309,21668,11807,1089,29892,3503,966,9638,361,3783,3435,2298,1559,19199,818,2257,712,29871,4277,29889,405,681,452,24684,787,2331,16454,1190,27441,1524,29892,15194,322,29891,4584,29892,16623,787,6003,381,27441,1524,818,8556,29889,1174,4951,29892,610,425,3814,12973,12033,424,343,261,29892,4457,265,373,26030,13545,25698,19503,29889,838,943,29892,373,263,6787,277,443,878,15340,1841,700,277,634,5466,29792,29892,1750,8164,23990,2872,1465,611,269,3498,316,301,29915,370,2015,20141,29892,634,1190,22025,1444,1236,1314,9073,316,5697,3246,1518,4894,2063,29889,9353,611,1243,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,18484,1750,20423,3669,600,1358,818,6815,21206,1808,1190,1597,3814,12973,29889,6803,26997,2257,712,432,29915,296,1975,29892,1190,966,13830,29892,432,29915,296,336,329,8997,1465,611,3814,12973,20629,1535,29892,1437,29894,787,2560,634,25456,634,432,29915,4582,2663,872,1841,1713,29889,6101,1444,16623,454,12491,29892,454,9668,1705,610,17488,707,712,432,29915,296,1975,443,3248,29889,315,3100,2453,329,2970,712,1354,301,29915,819,270,29915,14531,1465,301,29915,262,4951,634,301,29915,14531,29892,980,343,263,1487,270,2663,868,9668,1705,29892,13545,610,425,22916,29889,5879,277,818,17887,29892,432,29915,1794,6787,277,443,301,30000,27375,29892,1750,18332,425,3928,749,2637,966,11486,316,15188,634,966,12694,1237,325,1237,29889,341,1540,573,5278,1067,29948,29892,1444,325,2736,23469,16134,424,9073,301,29915,262,3901,29889,10793,10098,29892,1444,17043,275,425,286,3610,397,347,634,1444,14954,1173,454,2123,966,10814,29894,787,29889,6803,19397,8288,17789,582,533,29892,301,29915,271,7681,561,1908,634,425,11492,553,325,1237,1437,901
