According to you, on a scale of 0 to 2, how would you rate the narrative in the speech?\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No story.\n1 = The story is present but not relevant.\n2 = Useful narrative.\n\nMy answer is: 2 - Useful narrative. The speaker uses storytelling to illustrate their points and make them more relatable. For example, they use the metaphor of a farmer's field to explain the concept of variability in grain size and how it can affect yield. The narrative adds depth and complexity to the argument, making it more engaging and easier to understand.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,1735,10784,15819,29892,29871,4277,7890,610,280,29892,10814,289,801,29892,373,707,427,5644,262,28262,550,29889,29871,30219,29874,2947,1634,5761,297,5903,8270,358,24145,2258,15529,316,9364,276,634,427,28353,316,2257,302,29915,6272,533,29889,1551,263,9411,20737,18679,553,1136,21871,2063,868,1735,10784,15819,29892,553,1374,1690,290,22702,1841,21962,1237,634,5537,1237,4191,553,5694,22730,2123,553,7019,305,1253,267,29889,2664,9744,1179,9221,5283,267,1874,296,297,735,272,519,358,29889,6803,7814,21181,818,364,4600,29892,373,302,29915,29874,18413,4370,5695,20081,1190,18249,634,425,4665,14475,6773,270,29915,2987,358,261,29889,319,7890,29899,29873,29899,1808,29892,274,29915,342,1597,297,2445,284,2131,270,29915,5753,2093,3479,18475,2863,20196,7147,634,7890,8992,29920,1597,6434,6896,283,19505,427,6063,1577,838,943,439,7768,29892,1444,592,652,23469,7890,1577,838,943,373,16374,269,29915,21412,29889,1551,8164,3060,275,381,439,7768,4185,2147,634,534,8885,553,1197,7719,1750,269,29915,328,481,296,25235,10984,2993,12471,17239,5646,427,378,2974,443,10814,364,13469,358,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,1597,2284,9874,5516,344,316,2646,262,610,611,13639,1559,5606,29889,349,1267,787,316,1999,29948,610,17488,29889,438,1481,29892,432,29915,1794,6079,3710,492,29948,29889,1174,28353,29892,454,1999,29948,260,9030,29889,27677,270,2663,610,346,712,274,29915,342,425,269,4894,1808,425,2298,18834,1318,634,425,2298,1136,3011,1318,1465,454,9122,29889,8748,443,18480,316,1999,29948,1436,6311,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,712,274,29915,342,1577,315,29915,342,270,29915,24430,443,5419,270,29915,6430,583,610,611,1559,5606,1750,409,286,29915,9422,344,29892,7847,443,5419,316,2646,262,610,904,3334,29889,8748,427,4951,443,1083,572,790,482,316,521,562,348,316,7015,2646,1144,29889,4241,841,424,29892,14034,29920,29889,478,681,29871,22730,443,18308,301,436,424,270,29915,1540,1197,7342,316,1999,29948,29889,751,29875,263,301,29915,7308,4279,270,29915,28619,553,904,3334,1912,21394,316,2646,1144,29892,9411,316,260,8284,28374,29889,11948,5278,10098,29899,455,29892,782,3256,553,27799,492,5908,29892,2331,285,436,1572,993,7015,26695,29889,315,29915,342,9201,1671,7890,29889,478,681,639,311,29920,553,2646,1144,29889,2191,29884,7890,29871,22730,443,3104,296,709,29889,10016,8691,316,325,359,2646,1144,16933,9577,1083,572,347,29892,301,29915,18288,454,16933,7006,29889,478,327,276,29758,262,29892,443,18480,868,302,30069,2484,722,347,707,2852,3820,1318,29892,818,1597,14857,26742,2445,347,29889,365,1481,302,29915,29874,2331,21394,316,2646,262,610,904,3334,29892,3503,11797,3435,9411,260,8284,4457,309,7147,29889,838,943,29892,18097,425,7019,4630,12973,454,544,9061,29892,980,452,11113,2331,316,2646,262,29892,3503,9411,7015,2646,1144,3435,11387,27799,3687,29889,838,943,29892,1750,29892,818,425,15378,545,26742,2445,347,29892,1671,336,1424,265,357,454,22884,29892,634,12866,454,19643,358,454,2298,13714,29889,315,29915,342,2257,712,432,29915,9297,347,316,7199,9030,2535,611,266,17449,29889,2598,7017,1203,361,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,1893,566,631,966,1197,4427,7719,260,8284,316,2646,262,29892,634,316,4048,6390,1354,4875,1326,7081,316,28374,26742,2445,583,316,8556,427,2058,868,19643,358,29889,2598,18768,1203,361,29892,274,29915,342,316,1437,18821,261,3058,267,1197,7719,29892,5898,330,4211,1647,3700,818,443,22884,13180,6267,3710,492,30019,482,316,2646,262,29892,23068,818,425,1197,4427,2131,316,260,8284,316,2646,262,29889,6803,343,25497,276,29892,1444,2058,18402,1597,316,7015,1197,7719,1465,1597,4195,6056,744,29892,634,1465,1597,4195,22884,1318,29892,1750,3928,1465,1601,3209,818,443,9122,
