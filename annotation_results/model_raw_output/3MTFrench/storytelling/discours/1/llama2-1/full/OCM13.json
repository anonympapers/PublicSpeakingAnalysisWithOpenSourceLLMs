They mention specific statistics, such as the fact that there were 300 million tourists worldwide in 2017, and that the Oxitanie region is the fourth most popular destination for foreign tourists in France. The speaker also highlights the potential of the Indian market, citing the country's large population and growing middle class.\n\nThe speaker's use of history is pertinent because they are not simply relying on general trends or assumptions, but rather are providing specific examples and data to support their argument. By doing so, they are able to make a more convincing case for the potential of the tourism industry in the Oxitanie region.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,438,16099,966,521,2593,690,868,6371,6386,29889,16579,802,19951,29892,980,6728,29889,8748,274,29915,342,9577,6079,29889,2169,19755,29920,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29955,29889,10016,26744,1190,29871,29955,1465,454,9122,263,12278,351,29948,26269,316,425,3814,12973,29889,29871,30219,29874,7905,325,1300,712,301,29915,29949,29916,277,6067,707,425,29871,29946,29872,14326,316,3444,1671,425,4810,29902,553,6371,9230,23428,13873,29889,8748,29871,1654,29892,454,6371,6386,29892,274,29915,342,443,953,1129,347,1190,29871,29896,29900,29889,29871,30219,29874,7905,325,1300,712,301,29915,348,20854,355,28759,316,8689,29871,4277,409,454,17792,28504,21609,524,316,16573,316,29871,29941,29900,29900,14746,270,29915,513,3640,375,29889,478,681,7890,19643,29920,16731,29871,29941,29900,29900,14746,29892,274,29915,342,17256,10098,425,4665,11076,29889,8748,6079,19601,29892,1444,26099,7602,475,4979,712,301,29915,29949,29916,277,6067,263,9411,966,818,5646,1671,3999,1411,267,5278,15217,3132,15340,29889,838,943,14034,29920,29889,461,1006,768,487,4191,454,302,30069,2484,8164,9073,1671,3999,1411,267,29973,315,29915,342,13164,6371,2488,29889,478,681,29892,18097,7890,17751,482,29920,29899,23088,8992,29920,553,1634,5908,29973,8748,6079,19601,29892,1444,282,1947,712,966,6371,9230,1399,993,5695,29892,373,3008,28230,316,1634,5908,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,712,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,553,6851,29889,341,532,895,2123,2257,10484,276,1190,9411,966,714,2719,1750,14924,509,609,270,29915,5753,434,453,381,29892,337,841,381,634,9073,337,15470,7015,10984,2993,6371,9230,29889,751,1808,1889,375,1539,2484,427,2058,29973,751,4999,22060,29892,439,1379,13698,29973,8748,1671,339,7768,2331,1597,15217,29452,29973,478,681,301,29915,1351,29920,7199,275,29973,341,532,895,707,410,1028,2445,1230,29889,3067,4599,347,29892,26805,29892,29452,29899,327,29899,292,29892,5374,5458,29892,5278,23520,378,2265,484,5646,454,9122,610,346,439,29915,1808,29892,610,346,712,5646,454,9122,707,2411,492,17851,1465,2257,15744,29889,897,16573,2123,316,658,262,29892,5278,23520,707,4100,29889,838,943,29892,1444,282,1947,712,7814,6371,9230,1399,11689,29892,373,3008,28230,29892,439,29915,265,409,28704,316,856,951,289,919,361,316,1601,18848,707,316,285,2487,29539,966,289,24729,24792,743,29889,9353,301,29915,29882,25892,29899,29934,309,29892,425,24450,2633,29892,966,11840,6282,20385,29892,634,6701,7890,29892,1354,5291,408,343,443,29892,1465,325,359,8820,29889,838,943,29892,274,29915,342,325,17016,29892,980,343,263,3681,29892,274,29915,342,10814,29889,1720,343,263,454,1601,3514,436,295,315,29899,29949,29892,980,343,263,301,29915,29882,25892,316,3444,29892,3503,269,1829,29920,712,23778,29892,11797,3435,427,7945,316,5573,882,427,27289,261,454,8575,29948,1399,819,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,9983,1908,29892,432,29915,9983,1908,29892,3503,270,29915,314,2249,790,13805,29892,712,7890,3669,1403,9030,29920,316,2257,3256,29889,435,29915,9983,1908,712,2257,3256,16933,454,856,853,3256,4100,29892,10814,7890,29889,8748,432,29915,9983,1908,712,28194,7890,4325,9996,261,29948,553,6282,9230,707,534,574,743,1465,24145,22922,29892,7890,7890,1006,307,914,29920,29892,7890,29892,1190,2257,712,7890,282,6223,29920,9073,29892,1671,6628,1314,966,1035,434,453,381,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,2831,445,3414,29892,306,674,27599,278,1301,3395,4944,322,1234,278,5155,297,278,1797,896,2615,297,278,1139,15421,29889,13,13,16492,29871,29896,29906,29901,7579,304,366,29892,373,263,6287,310,29871,29900,304,29871,29906,29892,920,723,366,6554,278,671,310,4955,297,278,12032,29973,13,13,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29906,448,450,25657,3913,4955,13499,262,2
