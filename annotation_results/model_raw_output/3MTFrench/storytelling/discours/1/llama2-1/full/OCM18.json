According to the questionnaire, I will evaluate the narration on a scale of 0 to 2, where 0 means no history and 2 means pertinent use of history.\n\nThe speaker begins by mentioning that they are the \"cyber-doctor of shrimps,\" which suggests that they have a specific expertise in the field of shrimp health. They then explain that human activities produce numerous pollutants that are harmful to the environment, and that these pollutants can end up in our rivers, but how can we verify the water quality? The speaker proposes using dosages to check for pollutants, but this method has limitations. Instead, they suggest using a small shrimp as a \"superstar\" to detect pollutants in real-time.\n\nThe speaker then explains that they have been working on this project for three years and have gained significant knowledge about shrimp health. They mention that there are six common varieties of shrimps in Europe, and they have been studying their reactions to pollutants. The speaker also shares a personal anecdote about being told they would be working with shrimps, which they initially found amusing but eventually came to appreciate the importance of their work.\n\nBased on the narration provided, I would evaluate the history as follows:\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n0. No history - The speaker does not provide any historical context or background information to support their claims.\n\n1. Lacking pertinence - While the speaker does mention historical context, it is not directly related to the topic at hand. They do not provide any specific examples or anecdotes that demonstrate how their work has contributed to the field of shrimp health.\n\n2. Pertinent use of history - The speaker provides some historical context and background information related to their work, but it is not extensive enough to be considered a comprehensive history. They do mention the importance of studying shrimp health and how their work has contributed to this field, but more detail would be necessary to fully understand the significance of their findings.\n\nTherefore, I would choose Option 1, as the speaker does provide some historical context, but it is not directly related to the topic at
