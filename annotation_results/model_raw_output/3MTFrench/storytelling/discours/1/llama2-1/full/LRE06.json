The transcript is provided below, along with the questionnaire and options for each question.\n\nQuestion 12: According to you, on a scale of 0 to 2, how would you rate the narration in the speech?\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No history\n1 = History present but not relevant\n2 = Relevant use of history\n\nTranscript:\n\n\"Papa, my hand, I have some great news to tell you. I'm going to write a thesis on waste treatment. You know, really, you're going to be involved in this too, it's not just a study. But let me explain where my hand is. Of course, I'll put my hand in the dough, it's logical. And papa, that's exactly why I want to work on this topic. Most of the waste we produce is actually organic. So, who could be valorized energetically by metadesification? Yes, but it's exactly what happens in our digestive system. We eat, we digest, and then we join the ones and twos, with which we can produce energy. Voil√†, that's how I announced my topic to you. In our trash, that's what could be used to make energy tomorrow. Interested? Well, nearly half of our trash is actually metadesification. Hydrolytic is the first to work on it, then comes oxygen, then comes genes, which produces meta-n. My goal is simple: to produce more and more with less and less input. Imagine us working like a machine, with each employee corresponding to a group of bacteria, each with a specific function. Now, if enough oxygen is sick, it's a disaster, no one can replace it. Production stops, that's why I guarantee my employees optimal working conditions, such as a neutral pH or adapted agitation. And finally, I mix everything together, to tell you how much meta-n we could produce with the entirety of our organic waste to generate energy for tomorrow.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nThe narrative structure in this speech is a mixed one, combining different elements of storytelling and logical reasoning.\n\n* The speaker uses personal experience (their hand) as a way to introduce the topic and grab the audience's attention.\n* The speaker provides a clear and concise explanation of their research topic, using technical terms and concepts (metadesification, hydrolytic, oxygen, genes, meta-n) in a logical and organized manner.\n* The speaker uses rhetorical questions (interested?) to engage the audience and make them think about the potential impact of their research.\n* The speaker provides a clear goal or purpose for their research (produce more with less input) and explains how they plan to achieve it (by working like a machine with optimal conditions).\n* The speaker uses analogies (imagine us working like a machine) to help illustrate their points and make them more relatable.\n\nOverall, the narrative structure in this speech is informative, engaging, and logical, making use of a variety of techniques to convey the speaker's message
