The speaker provides examples of three cities (Madrid, London, and Paris) that have been affected by terrorist attacks, and argues that the government's plans for countering radicalization are lacking in functionality. They explain that the concept of radicalization lacks structure and is often misunderstood, leading to confusion and misinterpretation. The speaker also highlights the importance of giving more reference to the law when it comes to the notion of radicalization, as opposed to morality. Overall, the narrative in the speech is relevant and pertinent to the argument being made.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,9669,29892,15557,634,3681,29889,8316,275,4213,267,29892,7732,11875,2701,316,8441,29892,5227,407,2406,270,545,358,610,553,1098,296,1446,15115,9230,868,408,802,373,623,1808,425,24818,4371,29889,838,943,29892,3700,818,5278,1757,815,29892,966,19397,29879,970,29879,427,3444,3435,3984,427,2058,553,13900,316,15481,371,8474,425,24818,4371,29892,3503,1750,13149,6311,767,802,316,18165,20809,2131,29889,6803,339,7768,1577,315,29915,342,301,29915,348,553,21420,712,1444,1020,568,1465,611,266,17449,634,712,8556,599,787,8689,21285,29889,951,1203,361,316,5278,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,19397,2654,265,1089,18165,20809,2131,634,6366,562,2131,818,7015,13900,29889,838,943,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,309,452,2947,2331,2535,425,17837,316,24818,4371,7847,802,274,29915,342,4875,1750,707,427,4556,270,29915,24430,1577,6340,302,29915,29874,2331,316,3829,29889,405,29915,29891,11099,333,1387,29892,302,29915,29891,9638,22781,29889,1459,17488,29892,1465,454,25915,316,611,266,17449,29892,1444,592,26099,26842,404,29948,782,3814,4797,316,7175,7316,316,425,24818,4371,14649,1318,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29947,610,454,17284,29889,8748,818,7209,29899,29881,681,2062,895,29892,373,8164,343,8689,454,3184,24818,4371,3503,2331,1597,25642,10098,29892,2257,712,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,29889,20513,499,271,29892,7890,29871,22730,13220,29892,302,29915,1639,558,7342,610,1465,5278,17837,4191,10814,7890,3031,569,29889,29871,30219,29874,29892,274,29915,342,454,7017,1298,29889,26079,14910,609,425,17837,316,24818,4371,29892,4875,452,4021,28821,2331,29889,6340,766,15380,28821,29892,4875,263,2723,1509,29889,8748,427,2257,3209,29892,4875,263,8121,29948,818,425,24853,316,15237,2298,316,3036,744,29892,15237,2298,270,29915,2249,8194,29892,15237,2298,316,4771,800,29892,15237,2298,316,4771,800,427,282,20342,29889,11948,18413,2298,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,284,9551,29892,432,29915,1794,17751,2445,29875,29948,29892,3503,454,9551,707,4100,29892,13704,29899,27048,29892,274,29915,342,18413,2298,316,4771,29889,29871,30219,29874,29892,274,29915,342,454,18768,1298,29889,8748,454,22448,1298,29892,274,29915,342,712,425,17837,316,24818,4371,29892,4875,2313,4196,443,9577,4439,29892,2257,1750,707,14731,316,2257,1750,707,10918,284,29889,6101,1597,15096,316,1667,2453,329,1277,357,454,2989,29899,442,29892,868,8694,782,7431,2310,475,29892,1671,16454,818,425,12326,29948,316,24818,4371,29892,316,24818,6386,29892,6722,270,29915,275,5288,6386,29892,7006,527,13732,29889,6803,1120,424,29892,818,260,1808,29892,454,17950,10918,6311,316,454,9073,29892,316,454,1277,357,29889,438,1481,29892,12866,12326,261,7594,339,29915,348,316,9073,21907,12784,316,10918,284,29892,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,12326,29889,838,943,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,265,8164,9073,270,29915,24430,29892,980,21668,27516,818,425,17837,316,24818,4371,1597,2298,6815,1841,9625,782,17950,29892,610,346,712,454,17950,707,2893,28677,29892,425,3036,744,452,966,760,29889,2581,1236,1314,14954,4630,443,19696,371,316,17950,29892,1444,1236,1314,2331,14954,4630,443,19696,371,316,3036,744,29889,1174,13495,29892,373,452,8164,2331,425,29415,1190,443,6701,3814,634,2535,443,6701,20689,29892,425,24818,4371,29892,1597,26744,1750,25810,8691,316,425,12573,634,1597,14857,1750,409,1539,3018,1564,993,818,9364,276,427,4464,316,435,3610,370,562,379,17400,375,29892,7991,3222,29892,323,2753,29890,3222,29889,315,29915,342,2331,1950,29889,8748,7847,29892,980,21668,1874,261,24145,26722,316,1437,4951,381,966,521,15806,29889,1459,966,24818,275,800,29892,274,29915,342,9201,25160,29889,1459,966,270,29915,11236,6386,5537,1237,29892,274,29915,342,2298,7175,3
