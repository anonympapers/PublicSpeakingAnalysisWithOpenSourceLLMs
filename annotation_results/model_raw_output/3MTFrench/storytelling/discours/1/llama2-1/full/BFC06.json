{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-13T22:25:27.960576929Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I will analyze the narrative structure in the speech. The speaker is presenting a research project on the impact of lack of family support on young mothers' mental health. The transcript is divided into two parts: the first part describes the scene of Simba's birth and the second part presents the research project.\n\nIn the first part, the speaker uses vivid language to describe the scene of Simba's birth, including the sounds of the African savannah, the arrival of animals to welcome the new prince, and the ancestors' presence. The use of sensory details creates a sense of immersion in the scene, making it more engaging for the listener.\n\nIn the second part, the speaker presents their research project, focusing on the effects of lack of family support on young mothers' mental health. The project involved 35 young mothers, who were divided into two groups: those who received support and those who did not. The results showed that the mothers who did not receive support were more likely to develop symptoms of depression and anxiety over time, and had lower-quality conjugal, parental, and familial relationships.\n\nOverall, the narrative structure in the transcript is effective in presenting the research project. The use of descriptive language in the first part creates a vivid image of Simba's birth, while the second part provides a clear explanation of the research methodology and results. The speaker's use of conviction and enthusiasm for the topic also makes the presentation more engaging and convincing.\n\nIn terms of options for the narrative structure, I would choose option 2: Utilization pertinente de l'histoire. The speaker effectively uses the scene of Simba's birth as a hook to grab the listener's attention and then seamlessly transitions to presenting their research project. The use of the narrative frame helps to create a clear structure for the presentation and makes it easier for the listener to follow along.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,17043,5582,29920,3058,882,553,269,4167,6836,286,3610,272,5481,575,634,425,8861,20244,29892,14344,316,425,1055,9948,316,3439,2291,2535,5278,22577,15188,904,1089,29887,275,424,868,11412,316,425,6316,29889,1588,1540,29920,7732,1473,267,19397,623,7367,5278,20244,29892,282,30037,344,301,29915,351,1171,22781,29892,454,14419,309,409,301,15792,29892,425,269,29915,485,663,263,18961,457,634,9411,966,3778,2993,316,425,269,29915,3496,276,564,374,794,316,5646,610,1671,1035,434,453,381,425,9367,868,13164,15927,29889,341,5093,966,10359,30037,5888,17508,375,3435,18916,1671,409,883,333,519,634,6003,375,29889,4241,841,424,1444,7890,16193,1597,18768,1873,29889,1954,22094,29920,29892,2257,6701,17541,2093,3435,9411,966,3778,2993,316,425,4048,11276,634,7209,1153,7241,6578,1671,938,27083,261,3439,2291,818,425,28812,2535,1027,2037,29442,19874,29874,634,872,1153,10993,966,11825,316,3439,2291,29889,838,943,15237,5695,6079,1577,10050,29892,373,707,270,29915,5753,536,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,712,425,29580,371,21865,1572,868,12536,424,818,8121,261,443,17889,1465,454,3060,861,316,1601,29140,316,266,17449,29892,1444,325,1759,16134,424,7890,425,5814,5893,29889,422,1004,373,454,24722,1465,425,29580,371,316,425,5273,9948,316,3439,2291,29892,316,6003,381,11825,634,818,2723,453,1908,443,289,10126,29948,707,443,10019,1690,882,3817,1300,5218,29889,323,681,966,18490,316,425,28812,3435,7602,542,2406,29889,997,11449,29892,966,626,275,3503,5695,8648,966,29758,1144,29889,838,943,8556,5820,787,8997,316,872,18097,6701,270,29915,18704,712,301,29915,5903,1690,882,316,425,5273,9948,707,21617,29884,316,24145,19513,17543,744,443,10019,1690,882,4348,2491,782,1791,21867,782,7303,29889,2664,22114,11825,316,2257,3435,316,610,13258,275,452,2453,352,296,2331,316,15470,4595,29899,862,1237,29889,1459,16132,11797,3435,904,417,647,743,10505,1946,8105,882,316,10713,21038,29889,2664,1153,14125,3435,2473,2701,634,760,275,1354,20423,7848,712,966,29026,11825,409,5663,283,794,20536,1671,316,15470,11825,818,2723,453,1908,634,23532,1487,7431,2310,475,316,6267,289,10126,29948,29889,422,1004,1465,1597,266,17449,29892,373,452,8164,2331,5646,9073,29892,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,263,4370,1437,4387,29948,966,1801,1691,868,11482,1300,316,13267,819,1832,616,1190,454,316,15470,21428,29889,1281,4838,882,29892,439,1379,1801,1691,343,1078,269,29915,309,1190,966,29026,21428,7628,339,29915,1808,302,29915,342,2331,2793,1190,966,18490,316,6267,11449,427,316,29882,943,316,6267,378,12090,29892,7628,339,29915,1808,2906,7081,21428,29889,6803,269,29915,264,904,2608,29948,9073,29892,1444,592,26099,26842,404,29948,818,301,29915,29948,4068,316,6267,2852,481,347,11643,1387,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,29892,818,6267,19666,316,1437,2590,634,270,29915,264,5389,7342,782,9587,868,8714,634,8648,818,301,29915,29948,4068,316,425,4021,2131,553,5302,29889,1281,29926,688,744,29892,3847,284,634,1832,616,29889,9353,5278,1203,361,29892,1444,26099,599,29948,782,2432,25123,316,29871,29941,29945,29026,11825,29892,553,4832,3031,13116,782,29871,29896,29900,2123,11387,316,6267,289,10126,29948,29889,435,29915,1794,1757,29948,553,9953,2406,270,29915,264,17124,6609,29892,16623,2331,7015,5155,1056,2658,634,12036,261,553,5697,1169,12298,270,29915,1639,2467,1832,616,29889,435,29915,1794,443,269,29915,29891,3708,24984,29871,29906,29945,29900,1998,3246,818,2432,25123,29889,6803,9073,18475,441,381,966,12694,2063,29892,432,29915,1794,8572,29948,1601,904,13775,12794,316,29871,29941,29945,29026,21428,427,316,11107,29889,2664,286,5908,1750,4625,2653,289,25747,9639,631,316,13267,819,1832,616,634,966,286,5908,1750,302,29915
