The narration in the discourse of this transcription is pertinent as it provides examples and analogies to support the speaker's argument about the role of local authorities in international development. The use of the pat√© and foie gras analogy helps to illustrate the idea that different actors can have a legitimate role in shaping global governance, just like different ingredients can come together to create a unique dish. The speaker's experience and examples add depth to their argument and make it more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,18080,29892,17043,5582,29920,29899,23088,454,2123,301,29915,314,1908,316,26814,7096,1577,2581,7890,2437,568,5646,29892,29871,4277,14034,29920,454,2123,301,29915,314,1908,316,26814,7096,818,301,29915,19800,29879,1318,29892,766,424,782,15745,316,425,21919,29889,26383,5646,454,3390,712,1444,7890,18332,29892,274,29915,342,454,15745,29892,301,29915,25165,316,301,29915,29874,680,24305,297,29948,9639,815,634,297,1114,415,29948,269,29915,342,6624,1318,29889,2664,8478,7719,1887,267,2062,2108,296,301,29915,314,1908,316,425,24159,7890,592,2970,26477,29892,634,6079,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29945,29892,443,14954,1173,332,17153,970,263,443,20207,20827,634,269,29915,309,707,2778,29887,5128,29948,443,7877,15471,29889,3387,882,29892,1667,2167,344,14931,1190,966,15481,371,270,29915,13453,29884,663,1750,20423,1539,2484,2637,23778,29892,301,29915,16061,634,553,8478,7719,1887,267,553,301,29915,272,1912,553,6367,1080,29892,553,11984,553,10402,4110,634,6701,553,11510,1336,6544,14864,2257,316,3444,1465,301,29915,29874,680,782,24305,29889,2581,286,29915,524,29948,23458,2298,10816,3479,8478,7719,1887,267,316,22114,29899,509,283,1691,409,7691,29892,868,4595,29899,509,283,1691,409,7691,29892,610,346,439,29915,264,5246,29892,11797,3435,16530,20564,1044,3145,427,301,29915,314,7289,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,301,29915,1131,1829,316,1437,18821,261,29871,1654,301,29915,273,725,1288,4371,316,7015,1044,11620,1180,2993,26030,13545,7006,22786,743,454,1601,459,1772,770,1387,316,301,29915,16061,1465,966,5354,267,2649,267,712,301,29915,29874,680,316,24305,29889,478,681,7890,26427,29920,8164,29899,5474,29892,3503,439,29915,342,2257,712,29871,4277,1735,712,2257,12852,301,29915,16061,2123,966,8478,7719,1887,267,1750,946,19047,1577,1720,325,993,1840,4983,13349,14119,1597,22577,15690,347,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,4191,454,2373,29948,634,454,1701,347,867,294,29889,2581,7890,1518,9854,29889,1720,21668,6382,4983,425,20244,20110,4191,443,289,2029,316,1701,347,867,294,29889,8748,14864,966,13219,3842,4655,277,7147,553,5302,6121,267,29892,2257,289,2029,409,1841,22410,29948,270,29915,348,2348,29878,2487,993,29892,5412,634,12852,766,424,29892,2143,4983,301,29915,16061,29889,2448,25810,29899,346,439,29915,348,1804,27478,439,29915,1540,8478,2131,1887,267,25810,10918,21998,1671,1139,1089,1597,11398,20110,316,301,29915,16061,1577,315,29915,342,325,17016,301,29915,21871,27445,868,286,585,1564,275,748,7425,29892,4191,782,6299,316,454,2373,29948,634,454,1701,347,867,294,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,8997,454,13222,553,8595,29871,29896,29929,29947,29900,29892,553,8478,7719,1887,267,286,8603,296,553,8820,270,29915,328,29948,1830,358,634,610,6267,1518,4894,663,29892,634,6267,1518,1064,2938,20554,409,3435,7275,2406,4191,553,1044,11620,10918,277,1355,316,7015,24305,29889,8407,1298,6701,18097,29871,29906,29900,29900,29945,29892,966,5233,29899,11604,25238,790,10978,6267,17889,4191,7618,21101,1671,21609,19844,966,1203,10270,868,3533,29948,15421,1671,454,24305,29889,23719,1039,29892,9811,342,269,29915,1144,9695,1465,443,1139,21941,21394,2298,2919,316,2257,712,8556,9411,6382,262,787,316,425,15306,749,14475,634,6701,425,15306,749,316,7814,9744,29889,6298,980,343,427,263,2779,19882,1209,29948,1465,1597,13752,17449,316,2373,29948,29889,8526,301,29915,3027,270,29915,1540,6894,2131,270,29915,627,11620,29892,8556,17078,1080,925,882,12866,270,29915,1540,6894,2131,270,29915,348,4595,819,7209,1671,1120,424,427,11113,276,4021,2131,634,427,748,7425,29889,8748,868,10814,2373,29948,29892,1444,1236,1314,7890,2970,29892,432,29915,264,7468,25016,29948,29889,1588,2093,712,274,29915,342,10814,712,553,3516,21158,29
