They provide examples of how different countries have different laws and regulations regarding marriage, divorce, and name change, and how these can impact a person's rights as a citizen of Europe. The speaker argues that there needs to be a coordinated effort to establish a uniform set of rules for all European states to ensure that the rights of citizens are protected. They suggest creating an act of state civil that would include fundamental rights that could not be challenged.\n\nThe use of history in this speech is relevant and pertinent as it highlights the challenges and complexities of navigating different legal systems within Europe. By providing examples from the past, the speaker emphasizes the need for a more coordinated approach to protecting the rights of European citizens. The use of history also serves to underscore the importance of finding a balance between the sovereignty of individual states and the protection of fundamental rights for all citizens of Europe.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,11948,712,5246,29899,1808,316,325,9030,818,7006,17611,264,1577,2581,26099,11099,2488,634,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,966,260,294,14175,2719,29889,6803,7890,29892,980,452,269,29915,23121,3058,882,712,316,2560,11595,2131,19185,29889,1174,22259,2131,29892,966,260,294,14175,2719,29892,274,29915,342,6079,2298,712,29871,4277,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,24031,553,1044,267,1750,378,2265,484,26814,6316,316,26814,1055,9948,9291,29915,30001,26814,5758,29889,3185,29872,316,1055,9948,29892,316,15182,482,29892,316,4224,2093,29892,274,29915,342,26814,20206,270,29915,1693,2131,11099,333,1387,1190,22025,3435,28580,768,29879,9411,966,4441,1169,712,7890,8992,29920,1274,7680,5646,782,1472,316,26814,6316,29889,8407,2757,316,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,634,2298,16805,944,1465,454,9122,875,631,29892,274,29915,342,17950,1671,452,2331,7848,29892,452,3435,2331,13107,2249,2219,339,882,8265,29876,375,270,29915,348,2852,271,443,14857,29889,6101,7890,1437,8204,29920,316,1020,369,643,966,4565,29038,29892,1671,7890,27786,6701,8714,1671,20946,4193,1465,443,14857,9744,29892,443,2852,271,868,22916,316,872,3669,369,475,300,29948,29892,1671,443,2143,375,29948,316,25238,13639,443,1044,29872,29892,610,346,439,29915,309,452,3928,2331,818,872,26138,24228,29889,1174,1047,1004,29892,1465,2257,9744,29892,325,359,4441,1169,724,609,11113,375,29889,478,681,302,29915,735,1531,1249,2298,11099,333,8105,882,29889,405,29915,296,5705,8284,1136,2488,818,2852,566,631,7015,28374,18845,634,3686,388,6096,316,17124,4630,1597,2284,9874,29311,3381,553,27264,793,316,17950,29889,6803,10019,1524,29892,443,10395,420,6502,29892,15182,29948,427,3444,29892,425,285,30057,1173,1509,29892,4883,263,794,1973,29892,316,316,15470,10395,420,868,13185,29892,25074,16100,427,838,18453,29889,1174,11172,712,11099,2488,29892,432,29915,1794,553,714,2719,818,611,27963,29889,2664,13064,1080,6121,267,29892,966,27264,944,29879,17611,575,29892,966,1020,7719,29892,966,1437,3476,1080,316,425,6325,316,15426,316,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,966,22114,3420,267,316,425,6325,29211,29892,553,4441,1169,316,301,29915,21708,29889,6298,966,339,4999,29892,1444,286,29915,932,29884,347,1671,7175,2974,966,4441,1169,868,274,2049,11771,17611,264,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,1444,9551,1572,29875,6701,1597,1650,13149,744,29889,6803,339,7768,452,2331,9484,261,443,1044,29872,5412,1190,27612,25810,28580,768,29892,427,15017,2535,966,12503,29892,553,4441,1169,6299,1166,2993,29892,1750,452,1671,8356,18413,7848,1083,275,427,4556,29889,853,1044,29872,270,29915,28323,7631,17611,264,29889,11948,21181,302,29915,342,8121,29948,29892,634,4191,443,904,339,15943,276,2488,29892,432,29915,485,749,427,17124,13775,454,2923,25123,904,339,15943,276,2637,270,29915,348,21384,29892,966,3896,2872,553,12503,634,316,301,29915,18288,29892,425,17176,29948,553,4348,375,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,674,1234,278,1139,15421,408,4477,29901,13,13,16492,29871,29896,29906,29901,7579,304,366,29892,373,263,6287,310,29871,29900,304,29871,29906,29892,920,723,366,14707,278,671,310,4955,297,278,12032,29973,13,13,8375,10434,29901,29871,29906,448,22310,2133,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,13,13,1576,25657,3913,4955,304,1207,1009,1298,1048,278,13500,310,385,7824,1044,310,2106,7631,29889,2688,3867,6455,310,920,1422,10916,505,1422,14243,322,1072,8250,11211,13718,29892,25074,346,29892,322,1024,1735,29892,322,920,1438,508,10879,263,2022,29915,29879,10462,408,263,14497,264,310,4092,29889,450,25657,1852,1041,393,727,4225,304,367,263,6615,630,7225,304,10127,263,9090,731,310,6865,363,599,7824,5922,304,9801,393,278,10462,310,18363,526,63
