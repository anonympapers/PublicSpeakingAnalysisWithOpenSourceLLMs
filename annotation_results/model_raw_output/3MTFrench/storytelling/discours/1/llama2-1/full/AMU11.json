According to the questionnaire, I will evaluate the narration on a scale of 0 to 2, where 0 means no history, 1 means the history is present but not relevant, and 2 means a pertinent use of history.\n\nThe transcript begins with a statement about a communication system used by bacteria, which is the focus of the speaker's research. The speaker then explains how this system works, using technical terms such as \"molecules,\" \"message,\" and \"comportement.\" The narration is clear and concise, providing necessary information to understand the topic.\n\nThe speaker then introduces their thesis work, which involves developing an alternative to current therapies using a special enzyme called S-O-Pox. This enzyme is able to cut mol√©cules of communication, preventing bacteria from communicating and becoming more inoffensive. The speaker provides details on how this enzyme works and its potential benefits in fighting antibiotic-resistant infections.\n\nThroughout the transcript, the speaker uses technical terms and scientific jargon to explain their research. However, they also provide clear explanations and examples to make the topic accessible to a general audience. The narration is well-structured and easy to follow, with the speaker using transitions to connect their ideas and keep the listener engaged.\n\nBased on these factors, I would rate the narration in this public speech as a 2, meaning a pertinent use of history. The speaker provides clear explanations of their research and its potential benefits, while also using technical terms to convey the complexity of the topic. Overall, the narration is well-structured and easy to follow, making it an effective way to communicate scientific research to a general audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,2023,2994,420,14342,29920,29899,10873,29889,10050,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,1597,15217,4464,316,343,14895,1750,7890,7697,336,2298,367,585,634,2298,13052,296,29889,315,29915,342,443,21423,316,12084,3667,15826,610,3058,267,289,627,4894,1912,29889,6340,3667,895,2257,21423,1671,409,752,357,634,7744,29948,6267,20299,882,427,18165,316,4145,819,20554,3435,29889,461,29871,4277,18165,484,454,2994,420,14342,29920,29899,10873,29973,16579,802,289,627,4745,27666,1597,6062,29948,1810,484,1465,454,2643,634,2560,29889,2581,26099,18916,29889,2664,10890,289,627,4745,1437,371,312,296,7015,6062,29948,21337,634,427,1391,275,424,6701,29889,2581,26099,18916,29889,2581,26099,18916,29889,2581,26099,18916,29889,951,5419,316,6062,29948,21337,707,619,29948,782,5419,316,289,627,4745,29889,751,392,980,17631,5793,443,3058,5078,309,29892,27188,24969,29892,454,20299,882,316,14984,966,289,627,4745,1960,818,1874,261,29889,8748,18916,29892,29871,4277,8164,25595,358,7848,425,6635,481,473,8556,29892,966,3165,2708,29889,478,681,992,4099,29920,1597,289,627,4745,25642,1750,18331,610,756,538,1465,1597,715,29948,29889,6340,2947,28185,9373,17161,261,3999,8249,634,409,29585,22024,339,1924,427,1098,5818,7015,5614,1475,29889,11948,18097,20554,724,609,25235,29892,20554,325,609,1391,533,553,6062,29948,21337,304,29916,3783,29892,409,364,465,13365,2406,427,2174,802,634,6628,1314,409,11482,3906,8474,24145,21423,5198,348,9407,634,8474,966,3677,747,24414,3783,29889,438,30071,707,301,29915,262,1725,7066,29973,6803,611,266,17449,29892,1444,6427,8284,2535,443,3477,488,23662,29892,1661,29899,29920,326,317,29899,29903,29899,29949,29899,29925,2251,29889,1632,20032,818,15093,427,14022,29872,29892,1444,13942,29877,4798,1597,8671,3479,1935,2390,583,20331,4999,29889,951,14913,29899,21708,29892,439,29915,585,575,2790,29889,29871,30219,29874,5695,29892,274,29915,342,443,9122,316,9587,316,343,14895,29889,11948,29871,4277,1136,2488,818,6668,7808,454,14913,29899,348,29899,23149,2790,634,12866,3710,30037,4630,966,289,627,4745,316,3817,29875,7808,1671,966,7697,276,2298,297,2696,6270,29889,317,29899,29949,29899,29925,2251,18165,484,4191,443,17887,4365,29877,29889,6340,2947,15694,6947,944,4224,283,546,966,6062,29948,21337,316,12084,29889,438,29884,409,4207,1089,966,1444,1314,1190,425,29892,1444,4996,29892,1444,26099,4996,29892,425,4996,15142,29889,2664,289,627,4745,452,20423,2298,3817,29875,7808,29889,8748,12866,29892,18402,1597,7171,311,1487,20299,882,316,289,627,4745,25642,1465,1487,19480,29889,435,29915,1794,5291,6309,301,29915,29948,2416,562,2131,316,15093,714,309,1671,301,6463,8474,553,297,1725,1953,868,594,29882,10126,271,9989,1750,707,452,3435,2298,4771,13876,3479,3677,747,24414,3783,2123,818,270,29915,14559,10283,293,20060,29889,11001,267,4625,1874,29948,1671,7848,2428,6896,391,3794,29889,3674,29892,3503,992,4099,29920,29892,373,409,12563,25642,29892,4875,4079,1120,424,966,285,5908,29889,1174,13495,29892,425,8691,7175,3666,1318,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,26739,362,29892,17103,427,6267,12084,29889,2664,289,627,4745,409,11482,3906,11387,6079,634,2906,23510,12866,2298,4771,13876,3479,1020,667,1237,1863,1934,29889,11948,6896,499,271,29892,966,289,627,4745,409,260,23510,316,10984,2993,22024,339,7545,29889,11001,267,3435,11387,304,29916,3783,634,2298,19406,479,29889,951,2246,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,265,8164,2298,2258,455,944,966,904,2576,4983,427,22700,424,1597,437,344,2298,285,1794,569,316,10283,293,20060,29889,8407,2186,29892,6701,1354,1601,29140,452,14931,2331,2684,882,1190,1597,8774,386,356,316,26681,362,29892,980,8164,8164,29899,5474,7890,623,9555,425,5146,29872,938,22673,316,4
