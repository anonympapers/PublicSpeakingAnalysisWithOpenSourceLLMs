The speaker uses history to illustrate the relevance of their research and its potential impact on a global scale. They provide examples from their own work, such as creating a center for psychological support and using a specific medication, to demonstrate how their approach can be applied in different contexts, including those affected by war. The use of history helps to establish the speaker's credibility and expertise in the field, and provides a clear and compelling argument for the importance of their research.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,4078,29920,29892,980,343,263,443,8694,316,29580,371,29892,274,29915,14386,425,2635,270,29915,348,4946,5218,868,18669,790,12737,264,29889,29871,30219,29874,5246,29871,29947,6063,712,425,8713,2546,1826,1597,6434,316,12573,29892,2298,316,29871,29945,29900,29900,286,1924,17478,29892,553,14746,452,17065,743,634,443,5419,4963,942,297,15807,519,634,297,342,326,519,316,1020,398,271,7608,11643,1387,29889,7747,439,29915,265,872,277,610,8474,29892,274,29915,342,712,29871,29947,29900,29995,270,29915,14056,23778,325,609,13942,29877,2496,553,18835,6042,2993,1473,267,634,7456,712,425,1437,2590,29892,316,301,29915,8463,261,4370,553,788,919,1080,29892,2123,553,9201,316,22884,1400,456,15819,29889,1551,8164,9411,427,286,29915,264,27516,316,24145,6316,7848,21751,29948,818,1597,1757,815,316,5758,29889,8748,9460,818,15093,10019,1690,882,29892,373,2947,19397,13942,29877,2496,12694,1237,25828,30069,4467,1190,454,1472,9587,29889,1551,2947,19397,18475,296,381,553,2756,7147,270,29915,29948,558,29948,455,10270,29889,1551,2947,19397,18475,296,381,443,19688,270,29915,1144,29948,2764,2131,17667,29892,1597,639,371,1040,1647,29889,1551,2947,9073,553,1302,305,778,29899,27048,29892,373,263,2002,553,11013,1627,29879,29889,8526,2257,3256,29899,27048,29892,373,16933,1098,9030,1465,9201,316,22884,1400,456,15819,29889,4546,29875,29892,373,6427,8284,316,266,17449,29892,11797,1136,2488,818,1243,261,301,29915,29872,2416,562,2131,270,29915,1540,8774,386,356,15087,649,1387,29889,1551,2947,19397,3667,7608,1465,270,29915,5215,267,7594,378,29149,6701,427,6434,316,12573,29889,8748,1671,19397,1243,261,5278,8774,386,356,29892,5278,2134,1173,15087,649,1387,29892,432,29915,1794,9484,29948,427,4583,374,443,8442,316,13267,819,11643,20015,29892,1750,263,11878,9411,966,16283,553,1644,13116,270,29915,23578,1934,29889,8748,373,6267,263,9551,29948,427,9201,1950,298,1893,6947,649,1387,29892,1597,13219,2390,680,270,29915,735,3283,29892,2535,301,29915,29874,680,270,29915,348,10283,293,1166,1750,269,29915,932,1808,454,26138,385,1772,19091,29889,8748,274,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,1597,13219,2390,680,7037,4371,29889,838,943,29892,3022,29878,23855,882,29892,3440,29871,4277,409,21714,1577,11948,274,29915,342,9577,2560,29889,365,29915,23578,424,2947,6003,381,18475,14056,29889,1551,2947,3911,27516,5278,6062,29948,1810,802,1750,707,454,26138,385,1772,19091,29889,315,29915,342,1597,6062,29948,1810,802,373,17043,13871,9577,6079,29889,1551,425,20441,568,9411,966,16283,427,3444,29892,3420,6311,5881,29875,5458,29889,8748,7847,373,2947,425,29415,27962,29871,29929,29900,6233,454,8714,712,425,6062,29948,1810,412,263,269,29915,12352,300,29889,8407,25927,316,7015,29871,29929,29900,6233,29892,373,2947,378,1341,265,357,301,29915,23578,424,818,1487,26138,1841,20752,456,15819,29889,8748,274,29915,342,7175,3476,15471,818,2257,3256,29899,27048,316,301,29915,5903,10610,868,3669,15470,1020,398,15819,29892,439,29915,265,2947,1098,9030,868,10283,293,1166,1750,2653,5582,20854,11665,425,760,904,29885,8194,23497,29892,1750,707,4067,29948,818,15093,10019,1690,882,439,29915,309,343,7905,2723,29889,8748,12866,373,2906,8356,22964,2853,966,25828,30069,4467,1400,456,19669,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,29871,29896,29955,29900,21038,3435,1209,743,1465,2257,17814,10936,29892,4555,966,21038,325,609,12278,1875,589,9318,19601,29889,8748,373,263,966,5730,5908,6896,19718,413,948,3783,29889,13861,1597,269,2603,457,29892,1597,25642,269,2603,457,316,1020,17334,29892,373,263,1597,9922,895,29892,1597,22964,918,316,301,29915,8463,7342,1020,398,15819,316,301,29915,19809,316,29871,29955,29946,15543,8748,9291,29915,3
