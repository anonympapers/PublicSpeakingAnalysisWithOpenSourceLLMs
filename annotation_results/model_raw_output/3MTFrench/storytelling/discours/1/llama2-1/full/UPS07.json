The questionnaire includes three options for each question, and I will choose one option and provide a clear explanation for my choice.\n\nQuestion 12: According to you, on a scale of 0 to 2, how much narration is present in the discourse of this transcript?\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n0 = No narrative present.\n1 = Some narrative present, but not relevant to the main idea.\n2 = Relevant and pertinent use of narrative.\n\nMy choice: 2 - Relevant and pertinent use of narrative.\n\nThe transcript uses narrative structures throughout to convey the speaker's ideas and opinions. The speaker uses personal anecdotes, metaphors, and analogies to make their points more relatable and engaging. For example, the speaker uses the metaphor of a cannon producing 500 kilos of Simon each year to illustrate the massive scale of Simon production and its impact on the environment. The use of narrative structures helps to create a sense of coherence and flow in the discourse, making it easier for the listener to follow the speaker's argument.\n\nTherefore, I choose option 2 - Relevant and pertinent use of narrative.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1954,22094,29920,443,508,291,1750,18402,19951,325,993,316,1437,1066,261,19398,26814,14931,1597,23690,29899,880,484,316,7067,316,11254,29889,315,29915,342,6079,29871,4277,29892,29871,29945,29900,29900,4679,359,425,4323,2131,316,11254,1391,568,18402,19951,1671,18402,19951,29889,26383,29871,4277,373,6787,277,1465,4883,373,29892,7814,4213,267,29892,7814,25574,29889,1954,22094,29920,8532,301,29915,6574,627,316,5278,5802,20364,1190,301,29915,21813,17239,29889,365,29915,20041,2546,868,11254,707,5544,519,1671,29871,29896,29900,29995,553,29579,316,4810,29906,1465,301,29915,271,7681,561,1908,29889,29871,29896,29900,29995,20498,882,1671,454,11254,29889,1551,707,427,7945,316,610,1358,4883,270,1280,634,4473,8894,316,301,29915,524,1064,11992,782,29899,280,29899,3746,27666,610,966,29871,30037,5888,3165,2708,8997,553,6476,7799,29889,8748,1671,29873,424,26744,452,872,277,1841,295,944,3440,980,18165,484,29889,6803,339,7768,2257,25574,452,269,29915,12352,898,276,2331,1577,2598,3181,654,274,29915,342,270,29915,279,3511,634,23532,818,5278,1139,29889,8748,1671,2257,9073,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,270,29915,12572,4880,261,2257,1750,409,21714,1465,7814,11254,818,301,29915,17192,1808,9200,21785,1387,29889,1174,4951,1072,19755,29920,29892,1444,286,29915,4422,895,3058,882,2331,818,443,20710,1883,4338,29889,1551,1601,371,13219,272,1654,575,29892,432,29915,1794,9484,29948,1601,17887,28704,24127,316,289,29948,880,818,301,29915,4194,7289,712,1444,21714,553,26893,634,553,26893,818,16455,643,8694,818,26245,29889,4231,6311,1444,3534,4664,712,432,29915,932,29878,1975,427,904,1111,362,712,270,29915,14559,9638,361,3783,1671,427,3667,7608,2535,301,29915,267,1129,381,316,14710,1893,7608,443,13164,11254,8296,6896,22137,634,2298,904,21553,1387,29889,2581,7890,1518,9854,2257,712,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,20480,1540,904,1111,362,29892,1444,2504,1691,29889,6803,9073,29871,4277,29892,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,270,29915,28619,443,6761,533,1597,298,6844,270,29915,27419,29889,10016,2778,345,1924,1509,298,6844,270,29915,27419,1750,409,21714,1465,1597,289,29948,880,5289,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,13624,9301,316,4239,16530,690,316,11254,2893,3783,316,8323,302,2445,1230,29871,1654,427,10767,29884,29889,1551,28078,27275,269,29915,18852,1465,425,5469,316,503,711,4026,302,2445,1230,409,1634,852,29889,1394,29892,2257,6101,302,29915,279,4401,2331,1465,454,11254,29889,405,359,4239,16530,690,302,2445,5056,3435,5246,267,619,743,23068,818,301,29915,2467,553,5697,1169,29871,2884,13686,10270,1750,409,6411,328,296,5695,1465,24145,289,29948,880,5289,29889,12390,29871,2884,13686,10270,409,282,605,296,2637,7814,4239,16530,690,316,11254,634,980,21668,6079,454,2970,1354,6042,296,2257,7303,29889,1174,26379,29892,11797,263,19047,4191,1597,23056,4191,316,289,787,626,275,4191,443,2637,15182,634,15096,29892,2123,1671,17161,261,634,6079,1190,18249,18097,6701,544,29145,5198,711,2638,743,29892,3691,1179,316,1671,29871,29941,29900,6063,29889,853,766,899,431,793,29889,8748,5695,443,766,899,431,793,15210,454,619,264,2637,7814,4239,16530,690,316,11254,29889,10016,707,818,18413,610,1597,4889,4805,536,21735,29889,315,29915,342,23068,818,5278,4889,712,454,11254,707,425,23056,818,2298,6896,22137,316,378,1037,348,5340,29892,712,2257,25574,1750,263,10440,316,25927,8997,712,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,818,610,1358,29889,2581,26099,269,30095,29878,439,29915,348,8694,29892,373,564,3511,29874,818,13942,29877,2496,1597,15217,5960,749,1750,1766,1173,316,425,6701,2258,15529,712,454,11254,11399,9139,29892,3503,21394,11387,1248,12361,818,1391,533,29889,1551,263,2002,8532,443,11254,904,21553,1387,634,274,29915,342,2535,
