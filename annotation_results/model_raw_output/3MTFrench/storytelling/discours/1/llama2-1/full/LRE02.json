The speech is given by a geologist who is discussing the structure and composition of a volcano.\n\nThe speaker uses history in several ways throughout the speech. Firstly, they mention that the volcano is \"deserves to be studied\" (Option 1: Utilization pertinente de l'histoire) because it has been \"dead\" for over 20 years and has undergone \"subi of plein fou\" (Option 2: L'histoire est présente mais n'est pas pertinente). This suggests that the speaker is interested in the volcano's history and believes it is important to study it.\n\nSecondly, the speaker talks about the \"roges du pitton d'énergie\" (Option 2: L'histoire est présente mais n'est pas pertinente) and how they have been \"soignés\" (Option 1: Utilization pertinente de l'histoire) by the speaker. This implies that the speaker has a thorough understanding of the volcano's history and how it relates to its current state.\n\nFinally, the speaker mentions that they will \"essayer de savoir si les fractures du pitton n'est n'enagent de constituer par en réalité, un vaste réseau de canalisation\" (Option 2: L'histoire est presente mais n'est pas pertinente). This suggests that the speaker is interested in exploring the volcano's history and how it may relate to its internal structure.\n\nOverall, the speaker uses history in a pertinent and relevant way throughout the speech, demonstrating their knowledge and interest in the subject matter. Therefore, I would choose Option 1: Utilization pertinente de l'histoire.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2664,1700,3068,267,3435,553,29871,30037,5888,316,20491,29889,10050,29892,592,21028,262,424,29892,8556,21028,262,424,29889,11948,7015,1700,3068,267,452,3435,2331,5198,441,1379,29889,16932,1436,19047,23778,5695,610,29442,12416,29889,10050,2331,270,29915,348,564,4582,538,13544,29892,3503,28185,9373,270,29915,348,904,346,585,1652,15471,316,6267,274,16581,29892,425,282,9568,2320,2922,1387,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,26099,3516,1189,434,3829,284,895,634,454,282,1082,316,611,266,17449,316,1437,18821,261,301,29915,273,8678,347,270,29915,348,1700,3068,5758,634,427,9587,316,1437,22410,29948,1190,29889,7747,1700,3068,29892,274,29915,342,454,22754,880,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,634,18729,5246,2298,316,29871,29906,29900,6063,1750,269,29915,14386,443,1014,29875,316,5644,262,12584,634,966,938,3451,29948,2722,29889,4241,841,424,712,7015,1652,575,3435,907,375,2406,610,966,5902,1912,29892,966,11092,1759,267,875,29874,453,2406,610,966,364,8107,5908,634,712,966,904,3334,2631,868,18308,409,4079,10812,29892,19601,29892,17887,5758,295,29892,1601,330,283,600,276,1465,966,17424,7545,316,2257,10505,424,29889,3760,29877,634,301,1132,424,29892,260,29915,267,425,25974,262,818,6081,15093,831,4338,29892,1444,15199,1297,712,966,696,2710,868,22754,880,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,1720,302,29915,283,2204,347,270,29915,711,2974,553,285,1461,1973,29889,323,29915,267,2730,11771,316,6815,6635,579,1336,354,1750,521,1117,283,280,425,6316,316,1601,16500,634,752,9854,427,6094,520,293,29889,11948,29892,25902,29892,1136,2488,1465,443,7017,8714,818,610,16589,12416,553,20052,14228,316,2665,4285,18934,270,29915,1893,12478,381,1597,20206,29892,1437,307,1173,634,553,285,1461,1973,16474,882,316,20674,898,362,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,7774,4437,10505,20015,29889,435,29915,1794,5246,712,5291,8648,454,4392,264,13162,15471,5218,18934,316,1437,18821,261,425,15259,553,696,2710,712,432,29915,1794,577,647,29948,3479,18664,27254,302,29915,10978,3503,5695,6267,19406,479,23068,818,553,13917,782,9200,29899,6078,634,553,3483,952,267,20674,3783,269,3021,391,8105,2406,29889,28079,7015,16285,592,19172,296,8288,316,17789,1981,261,966,29871,29906,14746,270,29915,812,2406,553,298,5137,2658,316,2257,6316,1314,22754,880,270,29915,1690,30000,2710,7019,3075,4080,634,7015,22104,29889,11948,20957,424,782,285,1461,545,29892,610,346,712,966,285,1461,1973,3435,23063,23662,7719,29889,2664,285,1461,1973,3435,553,427,1753,29948,2204,21017,13855,5475,427,301,29915,29948,1555,29883,424,29889,8748,274,29915,342,270,29915,8284,1295,20554,1750,3435,818,301,29915,17234,553,904,8645,3687,634,553,3144,790,4110,316,15087,1144,29889,1720,707,12866,4100,316,4048,6390,1354,7015,285,1461,1973,409,3435,6079,1841,862,2406,6079,5321,296,1775,29948,29889,1174,5246,29892,1661,925,882,29892,610,346,712,1444,26099,10505,1189,434,3829,645,2488,634,1750,302,29915,342,3829,645,2488,553,12286,2923,1461,1973,634,12866,966,285,1461,1973,2331,286,29915,29874,7175,862,29948,29892,274,29915,342,925,29872,316,767,2265,611,30058,371,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,29889,2581,452,26099,12866,2331,25974,262,29892,12866,1444,452,26099,2331,966,577,647,743,29892,3503,818,4048,6390,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,443,7213,275,272,11643,4745,1314,29889,11948,7594,8164,29899,5474,7848,2257,534,743,272,1190,443,1700,260,29915,264,707,443,16794,634,454,22754,880,302,29915,342,302,29915,264,14748,29889,997,521,744,332,707,10019,680,29885,358,29892,274,29915,342,28185,9373,454,10329,566,270,29915,28619,10273,533,29889,997,10505,720,837,347,316,1487,17887,2245,29889,11948,29871,4277,260,29915,13989,866,29889,461,4048,6390,
