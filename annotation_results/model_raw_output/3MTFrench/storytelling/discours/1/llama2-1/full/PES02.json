The speaker uses the history of the bicycle to illustrate how its representation in society has evolved over time, from a symbol of distinction among the bourgeoisie in the late 19th century to a symbol of emancipation for the working classes in the early 20th century, and then to an ecological mode of transportation in the present day.
