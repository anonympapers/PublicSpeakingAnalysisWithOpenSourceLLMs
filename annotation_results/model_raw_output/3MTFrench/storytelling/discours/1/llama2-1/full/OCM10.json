I will choose one option from the OPTIONS for each question and provide the answer in the form of Option chosen: 0, 1, or 2.\n\nQuestion 12: According to you, on a scale of 0 to 2, how pertinent is the narration in the discourse of this transcription?\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n0 = Not relevant at all\n1 = Somewhat relevant\n2 = Very relevant\n\nMy answer is: Option chosen: 2 (Very relevant)\n\nThe narration in the transcription is very pertinent as it provides a framework for understanding the importance of protecting the biodiversity of deep-sea environments. The use of the metaphor of the \"hidden world\" in the ocean, and the comparison to the human digestive system, helps to emphasize the significance of these ecosystems and the need for proper regulation to prevent their destruction. The narrator's passion and enthusiasm for their research are also evident throughout the transcription, which adds to the overall impact of the message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,405,681,4760,787,1597,12563,22577,3814,12973,1465,443,29403,4946,29889,405,681,425,3814,18484,29892,425,3814,12973,10767,29884,29889,11948,1465,9411,2257,10767,29884,29892,980,343,263,316,425,16380,280,29892,316,425,330,13796,29892,633,790,744,1750,1162,5128,276,454,6299,270,29915,29948,1050,29889,29871,30219,29874,325,1300,4883,29881,1280,4473,8894,712,5278,16380,280,29892,274,29915,342,425,2730,26665,316,425,7101,316,425,18249,29892,3814,12973,330,13796,29892,373,2906,8356,2970,29889,1394,29892,5278,16380,280,27597,818,7814,26809,29892,633,1377,443,4946,610,497,15340,29892,270,29915,3742,307,2918,519,22577,282,12973,29892,22577,2123,29875,29892,3503,3686,296,709,1671,301,29915,21871,15943,276,316,24145,3814,12973,29889,1704,20554,3435,443,611,12794,4100,316,425,10329,28123,20196,5218,553,12954,29948,550,29892,634,26154,29892,20554,263,680,818,1162,15896,425,1775,5289,1750,6454,915,316,425,7101,316,301,29915,14531,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,7015,5697,3246,289,22730,3435,316,2298,427,2298,1757,562,2406,610,966,5039,7719,3165,13116,29889,405,681,9364,787,29892,427,2257,3256,29892,1597,3236,818,301,29915,2817,882,1671,301,29915,4548,417,7018,316,7814,2174,1475,633,790,2122,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,301,29915,16063,475,707,544,11992,818,289,30095,29880,29899,29881,359,1808,6299,29948,1050,1671,427,4805,533,553,1375,6947,1314,29892,4191,454,11872,1974,29892,454,274,711,1997,2123,966,1935,13678,29889,838,943,980,8556,21668,316,15378,545,6367,944,362,1671,410,6772,914,2257,2778,345,1924,1314,4883,4457,1531,13805,634,13747,29889,405,681,1029,787,3008,28230,270,29915,1540,8774,386,356,6366,815,1671,7697,276,7962,301,29915,262,12872,316,7814,633,29284,29892,634,19397,904,791,2853,301,29915,6574,627,316,7814,5039,7719,1465,5278,4946,29892,1750,8556,1702,13871,269,29915,309,2123,443,8714,634,1750,707,1671,29873,424,1354,410,1173,316,8556,29889,18375,654,9139,944,3440,16623,787,29899,29876,681,29973,382,29882,6079,29892,427,8556,15935,484,553,26893,29892,553,16283,29892,553,3031,13116,29892,992,533,553,17478,782,20710,1883,4338,818,4880,261,2637,966,13830,316,269,1849,1671,904,3090,914,5278,22577,289,9061,29889,8748,980,343,427,263,5644,568,332,553,1644,13116,29892,553,3533,4285,610,772,647,743,316,330,912,29892,553,14979,23435,29892,553,302,2249,14075,29892,553,1248,8105,21158,29892,634,6701,553,11364,4481,3076,29892,7015,2894,1608,267,4805,536,1099,2658,1750,6896,9696,818,14984,966,5855,316,3165,680,29892,6701,818,14344,316,301,29915,267,3535,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,454,20710,1883,4338,29892,29871,4277,29892,16067,868,8714,29889,8748,373,263,3008,28230,270,29915,1540,8774,386,356,2298,25595,1671,16454,818,425,6701,325,3246,344,712,301,29915,20041,2546,29889,838,943,1465,611,266,17449,29892,432,29915,20640,895,1597,15217,2134,1173,29892,2298,6366,815,1559,4875,14924,316,1437,371,312,261,5646,301,29915,279,1030,868,9364,424,29889,435,29915,4422,895,425,25348,12471,17239,744,29892,712,432,29915,1062,8356,1513,882,316,425,16380,29872,633,790,744,29889,1720,640,993,425,25348,316,14984,966,5697,3246,289,22730,1750,9364,296,29889,2581,1072,19755,18158,553,29026,3965,275,29892,553,29026,29892,427,3817,818,9411,966,2894,1608,267,9364,1934,29889,319,7890,29892,818,19601,634,818,4875,29892,7015,29026,409,3435,553,29026,11561,29899,1646,690,1750,19172,296,427,966,4224,397,1934,270,29915,25378,966,5152,17893,5814,5326,29889,1632,20032,818,5278,15217,8774,386,356,29892,373,16455,344,427,553,16380,267,633,790,2122,29892,544,29145,454,12491,760,449,1465,454,9122,29889,2581,2181,1318,1597,7774,4437,316,425,289,2660,1536,2131,316,7814
