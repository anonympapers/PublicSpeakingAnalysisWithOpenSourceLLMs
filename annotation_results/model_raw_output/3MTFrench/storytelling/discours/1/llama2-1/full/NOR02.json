The speaker uses historical examples to illustrate their points, such as the example of farmers who work with chemicals and pesticides, and how they are at risk of developing certain diseases. The speaker also mentions the importance of understanding the entire professional life of farmers to estimate and evaluate exposure to chemicals. This use of history is relevant in supporting the speaker's argument and providing a clearer picture of the issue at hand.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,712,7890,28078,11867,7890,9073,2298,11364,29892,1597,1139,13483,1671,11172,439,29915,265,2174,802,29892,712,301,29915,265,263,5646,269,29915,296,355,29884,782,11387,1597,10098,1671,270,29915,348,472,276,12491,29889,19551,802,432,29915,28899,275,2298,17222,29892,1671,286,29915,29874,1241,818,25497,276,818,5278,1139,29892,373,5178,1924,18484,316,3060,275,381,443,11510,631,712,432,29915,264,29878,30037,793,29892,712,18729,378,2974,1249,611,20877,29948,29889,6101,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,9201,427,5644,262,316,325,359,1437,1859,583,6351,29876,4999,712,432,29915,1794,2653,9073,9291,29915,30001,16474,29892,980,3031,569,1841,637,424,712,2257,27923,302,29915,29874,2002,993,2331,818,5646,427,521,562,348,29889,8748,712,301,29915,27419,316,1487,11510,631,452,17512,1875,1249,2331,427,12563,23563,8714,872,20877,29948,29889,28720,17488,29892,454,9982,351,5606,1810,371,332,18484,15935,5483,610,10713,875,307,1169,29892,11797,3435,13149,6311,427,26713,20877,29948,712,425,1841,2170,818,4665,29889,16932,285,2017,11387,29892,11797,289,692,296,2298,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,11797,269,13365,296,1841,2445,6311,439,29915,2719,577,993,2298,564,3780,267,712,270,29915,28619,3058,267,2224,11763,29889,365,29915,296,336,2073,29892,966,301,29915,23578,30069,4467,302,29915,609,316,2257,439,29915,309,343,263,29889,2726,508,22543,1274,6947,2658,1750,260,9373,12694,1237,3038,2540,316,24145,13625,15422,743,818,8556,11482,9030,8474,966,24424,29892,966,270,627,29948,2722,29889,838,943,29892,3440,29231,5495,29892,8164,29899,309,427,1579,3837,2265,6267,20877,29948,29973,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,5646,301,29915,711,4026,316,611,266,17449,29892,7199,9030,439,29915,4999,3435,966,7877,29948,1860,29892,2858,1547,13876,270,29915,13453,3837,2265,425,3681,819,2123,316,3038,267,427,285,2017,14255,966,9221,12906,371,1295,29889,2581,16623,346,712,1601,16794,316,301,29915,29948,5935,2249,347,5458,29889,16579,802,1775,262,29892,1444,592,966,427,29880,15792,425,282,866,29899,305,1908,29899,433,29899,29887,1280,29889,838,943,29892,425,8861,904,941,412,16374,1791,261,425,13773,316,12326,29889,6212,2509,29892,1354,5152,8146,7890,302,29915,29874,545,29920,2331,1671,1120,424,2970,712,282,519,29892,260,29915,264,4771,818,425,5814,2673,270,29915,1789,9948,29889,315,3100,301,29915,5753,398,2785,316,544,29145,2123,270,29915,513,1575,19172,336,316,1437,4951,381,2123,1661,29892,301,29915,562,786,348,4427,2131,270,29915,1144,375,1103,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,1354,1601,10420,296,29892,425,13773,269,29915,328,538,276,454,9122,24286,29889,8407,9587,316,6267,6316,6351,23497,29892,966,9221,12906,371,1295,4079,28374,4072,270,29915,4999,29899,29890,30057,6609,316,9257,29892,18484,966,4239,427,6701,8714,29889,8748,29892,21668,8648,5646,443,21285,316,260,30057,6609,27858,904,1707,4926,267,29889,3599,324,2167,3435,553,3778,2993,29892,8324,316,282,15931,2247,29892,610,1601,578,3123,553,282,15931,2247,29889,1720,19947,553,902,29890,293,2247,29892,553,17564,293,2247,29892,553,6299,29879,316,23921,680,29892,2298,316,286,1924,6062,29948,21337,28374,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,3008,28230,316,17043,13639,301,29915,24031,316,425,6316,6351,23497,553,9221,12906,371,1295,1671,7199,9030,782,6628,1314,1671,707,4193,634,904,791,2853,782,6628,1314,966,2258,1169,316,521,562,1540,316,7015,14060,2187,1190,425,10503,29948,1240,802,3038,267,1871,29872,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,2331,316,4933,2980,29948,454,8714,29889,838,943,29892,3440,4048,6390,1750,707,2123,263,4370,14060,29948,818,439,7768,29973,435,29915,1794,301,29915,6727,5580,316,10212,818,611,27963,29892,425,286,2249,14119,316,29871,29896,29947,29900,29871,29
