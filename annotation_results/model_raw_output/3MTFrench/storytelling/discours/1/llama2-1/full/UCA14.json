{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-14T01:25:41.310519455Z","response":"Based on the transcription provided, I will analyze the narration in the discourse of the speaker. According to the questionnaire, the options for evaluating the narration are:\n\n0 = Pas d'histoire (No history)\n1 = L'histoire est pr√©sent (The history is present) but not relevant\n2 = Utilisation pertinente de l'histoire (Relevant use of history)\n\nBased on my analysis, I would choose option 2, Utilisation pertinente de l'histoire. The speaker uses history to reinforce their message and create a sense of familiarity with the audience. They mention \"if you put the whole ritual on,\" which suggests that they are referring to a specific tradition or practice. The speaker also uses historical references to make their point more relatable, such as \"If there is a problem, you can't get into the world.\"\n\nThroughout the transcript, the speaker switches between past and present tenses, which adds depth and complexity to their message. They use phrases like \"I'm going to work out\" and \"I'm not sure if you can see it,\" which creates a sense of uncertainty and self-awareness.\n\nOverall, the speaker's narration is pertinent and relevant to the message they are trying to convey, and their use of history adds depth and context to their argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,3115,29892,565,366,1925,278,3353,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,11509,304,437,445,29889,960,727,338,263,1108,29892,366,508,29915,29873,679,964,278,3186,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,1126,769,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,27101,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,960,896,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,1126,565,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,408,565,896,29915,276,640,22155,278,5874,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,1126,769,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,1126,769,366,29915,645,1284,263,2250,631,2022,363,366,29889,887,29915,645,1284,263,2250,631,322,2250,631,2022,29889,306,29915,29885,451,1854,565,366,508,1074,278,4328,1546,278,1023,310,502,29889,450,7826,322,902,2318,29892,278,1023,310,502,29892,591,1016,29915,29873,505,738,4344,29889,1126,591,1016,29915,29873,505,304,4459,278,4328,1546,278,1023,310,502,29889,2193,29915,29879,393,29889,1334,1016,29915,29873,505,304,1348,393,591,508,29915,29873,748,1549,278,2318,29889,1334,1016,29915,29873,505,304,1348,393,591,29915,276,2675,1549,278,2318,29889,1126,769,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29892,451,925,393,29889,1334,1016,29915,29873,505,304,1348,393,591,29915,276,2675,1549,278,2318,29889,1334,1016,29915,29873,505,304,1348,393,591,508,437,445,29889,1334,1016,29915,29873,505,304,1348,393,591,508,437,445,29889,1334,508,679,263,1422,760,310,372,29889,1334,1016,29915,29873,505,304,1348,393,591,508,437,445,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,451,1854,565,366,508,1074,372,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,
