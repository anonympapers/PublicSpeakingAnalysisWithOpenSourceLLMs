The transcription provides a clear and concise explanation of the two opportunities that were identified in the laboratory work: the use of wood waste as a source of molecules of interest, and the development of a composite material using a mixture of wood and plastic. The narrative history is useful in providing context and background information on the importance of valorizing wood waste and the potential benefits of using it in the production of composites.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,9583,26477,29899,23088,29892,7907,454,4886,24195,13569,631,29892,818,341,10131,819,29892,454,18768,2298,6815,4886,24195,13569,631,868,9122,634,454,4886,24195,868,29723,29889,8748,454,9899,265,29892,16623,424,8691,868,4886,24195,868,29723,29892,12866,454,9899,265,3119,14785,443,3104,296,709,13569,631,23837,1387,286,29915,264,791,29367,519,29889,1174,29871,29906,29900,29900,29929,29892,454,17284,11880,3409,29948,4224,1458,270,29915,1639,29881,1169,301,29915,15843,362,316,1487,23734,29892,5898,13618,316,867,2017,1224,966,9744,23428,13873,29889,315,29915,342,4224,2459,868,9899,265,263,11878,18097,6701,2331,712,260,29915,267,4655,29889,1174,301,29915,2987,358,362,316,425,13852,634,270,29915,29948,506,284,4371,316,301,29915,18642,868,23734,29892,274,29915,342,1750,707,6079,29889,1174,4239,29892,301,29915,2987,358,362,868,7977,553,1437,305,1691,316,23734,302,29915,609,16497,11728,29892,274,29915,342,1750,707,286,585,1564,275,29889,319,3911,29899,19521,375,316,2257,1040,271,29892,8556,452,1047,4467,926,743,425,1139,316,4048,6390,29889,11948,7594,2730,11771,29892,7209,282,4926,6366,815,29892,1925,787,28643,1671,16497,7608,5278,4768,290,465,5528,4983,347,29871,29906,29946,26893,1190,29871,29906,29946,610,966,6397,2722,316,425,8861,634,316,425,18768,13852,868,23734,868,9899,265,29892,782,10684,634,316,301,29915,542,283,12031,427,28353,29889,1174,20744,29892,301,29915,542,5128,29948,6303,443,23734,1750,3119,14785,443,3104,296,709,23837,1387,904,12324,29872,29892,7847,802,2257,23734,707,28643,8997,553,4224,2108,583,1671,872,4021,2131,1083,19862,519,818,301,29915,3470,5218,1841,9252,316,640,3445,433,1113,275,270,29915,735,3729,2016,4021,2131,29889,29871,30219,29874,1147,336,712,425,19489,30000,1030,610,29888,398,1064,1318,29892,6111,360,1611,29892,3667,895,425,6896,457,29892,1663,29884,347,868,23734,316,3581,1050,1671,425,16987,782,1298,316,3999,610,29888,1144,634,712,5278,6896,457,707,21394,3667,15826,1465,454,2432,9874,316,425,1374,2817,1279,5458,634,316,425,1437,314,271,5458,29889,350,999,29892,1671,2062,9030,818,425,1139,316,926,261,29892,4239,11406,5441,743,3479,11406,5441,743,269,29915,264,571,4515,29889,7338,29878,5908,316,26722,5466,6832,1318,634,22903,782,9899,265,966,6062,29948,21337,270,29915,524,1064,11992,29889,435,29915,296,1975,610,11387,966,21337,270,29915,524,1064,11992,29892,966,15680,9789,3775,29892,13547,439,29915,1808,707,6624,296,29892,1671,427,9073,553,594,743,10270,29892,4768,2209,473,29883,743,29892,15390,316,17055,7608,2535,553,594,743,10270,818,2967,868,1841,689,29872,29892,7814,521,2593,690,818,1472,20689,1671,301,29915,21708,634,1487,12471,17239,29889,2581,872,275,29892,10814,2245,270,29915,348,5646,7890,29892,2257,26427,29892,274,29915,342,12528,29892,260,29915,294,29899,29876,681,29889,951,260,30057,1089,707,443,16772,553,17751,1893,2993,1750,432,29915,1794,301,29915,272,1772,316,11510,19388,3246,1473,7147,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,316,13047,316,301,29915,30057,1030,8474,966,263,3663,359,7441,29892,4555,966,5663,283,794,4655,277,7147,286,1862,1465,966,24618,2361,29889,6561,2409,29892,454,260,30057,1089,707,443,875,631,11423,1750,15481,371,8474,454,6316,453,11537,29889,1551,454,5663,6223,1465,454,260,30057,1089,29892,712,8556,1136,3011,787,782,13911,333,819,634,26154,1465,454,367,29884,29892,373,1147,336,6722,1444,452,7613,585,29889,997,18768,28602,2131,1750,269,29915,264,571,1056,29892,707,425,16987,782,1298,270,29915,262,22410,568,29889,1952,275,29892,715,579,1387,29892,427,286,3610,927,424,29892,316,425,1354,545,316,23734,29892,818,425,1354,545,316,715,579,1387,1671,427,9073,443,7243,484,585,29
