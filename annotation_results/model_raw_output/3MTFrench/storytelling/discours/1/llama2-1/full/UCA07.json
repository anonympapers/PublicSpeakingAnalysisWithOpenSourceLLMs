According to the questionnaire, I will be scoring the narration on a scale of 0 to 2, where 0 means no history, 1 means the history is present but not relevant, and 2 means the history is used appropriately.\n\nAfter listening to the speech transcript, I have evaluated the narration as follows:\n\nQuestion 12: According to you, on a scale of 0 to 2, how would you rate the narration in this speech?\n\nOption chosen: 2 (The history is used appropriately)\n\nExplanation: The speaker uses historical references throughout the speech to support their argument and create a sense of familiarity and shared experience with the audience. The history is relevant and adds depth to the speaker's points, making it a compelling narrative. Therefore, I have chosen option 2 for this question.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,939,28029,2569,12275,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29309,29935,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29892,1786,29921,29889,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,30098,939,2031,29892,1786,29921,29889,2014,1229,8641,29973,1651,2384,2584,6122,733,4816,11570,3531,25447,29889,20782,5865,23618,29932,29892,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,1291,2282,4553,5413,6408,29892,1097,6408,5865,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,3574,29892,3574,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,3574,29892,3574,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,3574,29892,3574,29892,3574,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,3574,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,8826,29919,29889
