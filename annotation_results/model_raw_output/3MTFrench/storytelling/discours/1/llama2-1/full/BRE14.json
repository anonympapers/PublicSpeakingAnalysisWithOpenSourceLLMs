The speaker uses narration to structure their discourse and provide context for their ideas. The narration helps to explain the speaker's research topic and how it relates to the broader issue of modernity and coloniality. The speaker also uses narration to illustrate their points, such as when they describe the way indigenous peoples were described in 19th-century works or how they identify modern colonial language patterns. Overall, the narration in the speaker's discourse is relevant and useful in conveying their message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,350,999,29892,432,29915,4548,9854,1759,611,266,17449,29889,435,29915,28899,275,818,9243,566,22756,2261,276,29892,427,592,29883,872,410,1173,29892,373,2313,1082,29892,980,592,26427,2257,712,1444,16623,1465,425,6316,29889,8748,1354,373,5291,16623,439,7768,1465,425,6316,1577,2581,25497,29879,1444,16623,1597,266,17449,29889,1720,592,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29892,980,592,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29889,1720,966,372,361,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,9667,29948,29889,8748,4875,707,1190,439,7768,11062,266,17449,1577,2581,25497,29879,29889,6298,966,1095,335,22702,316,425,349,20056,634,316,425,4121,351,9599,29892,427,19896,457,29889,1720,5246,1487,3144,14029,26842,404,29948,29892,980,592,26427,553,7175,3476,1080,29889,1720,269,29915,524,29948,23458,29889,3674,29892,1444,26099,1465,611,772,1173,29892,29871,4277,18062,1597,2930,10491,29892,1444,592,28905,29889,1174,5246,29892,966,2313,2470,1190,454,410,629,2093,29892,454,24305,29892,966,953,273,7334,800,29892,3435,4191,454,21384,8230,316,425,2930,10491,29889,7747,439,29915,265,2947,623,7367,18916,5400,2131,29889,315,29915,342,2257,712,301,29915,265,8556,7629,276,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,265,24722,10042,5646,29889,11948,301,29915,735,2488,363,29883,15471,454,1224,424,316,5278,2930,10491,29892,712,5291,2906,1475,29892,3503,1750,302,29915,342,2331,7962,1465,301,29915,6727,2487,7163,29889,10793,3700,274,496,1318,12450,2016,301,29915,9354,23881,29892,301,29915,262,571,1611,4371,29892,425,2432,3381,316,23563,7006,29889,7747,439,29915,265,2947,623,7367,18916,25539,2131,29889,897,26722,13149,744,29892,5278,2930,10491,5829,15826,454,9122,634,872,1480,1387,316,18165,17239,29889,1720,452,8164,343,11469,316,5400,2131,7209,25539,2131,29889,319,8019,316,2257,5246,29892,19601,29892,432,29915,24209,344,966,8774,3068,1608,267,316,5278,1480,1387,270,29915,29877,30071,29880,1465,454,541,316,7199,9030,3440,425,5400,2131,263,5221,29948,818,301,29915,29948,2576,3381,4824,1387,316,3058,267,9434,375,634,301,29915,29948,2576,3381,5829,1387,553,10890,427,19896,457,782,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29889,1720,286,29915,4582,2663,29892,980,286,29915,4582,2663,2331,29892,274,29915,342,454,286,4582,2663,29889,2581,6773,29889,1174,13495,29892,2257,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,1465,425,18768,8691,316,611,17949,409,3435,966,10419,800,1426,29884,4999,29889,435,29915,711,16349,4191,966,288,29872,4090,276,868,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,1750,1437,699,1960,966,1399,335,22702,29892,373,3534,4664,7015,4239,2258,29284,29889,1174,5246,29892,1444,454,872,275,712,270,29915,25378,1597,26722,270,29915,29948,699,29878,24635,8104,4379,29892,553,286,1862,29892,553,266,19503,29892,553,13994,316,3114,29892,553,18845,29892,553,298,5137,2658,818,18741,29948,29892,553,4047,2063,1750,6664,23510,10741,10098,1465,1601,1034,13364,29889,8748,1750,3435,1559,23096,316,5278,1480,1387,712,432,29915,1794,1437,4951,275,427,2504,759,8691,29889,1720,5246,427,330,4196,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,7787,29892,980,16067,443,564,3274,533,2174,861,29892,980,592,26427,1671,339,7768,432,29915,1794,3060,10770,316,29231,5495,1190,2257,29140,29889,435,29915,1794,25497,29889,435,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,1539,2484,427,19703,5289,425,5400,2131,29892,425,25539,2131,316,24145,9122,29892,1465,454,541,316,1841,1579,17192,381,1190,966,1136,21871,2063,2832,3783,634,2893,277,7147,29892,3033,355,5606,610,966,2313,2470,270,29915,326,1545,824,267,9291,29915,30001,7814,16283,29889,951,13659,316,301,29915,348,329,2779,29884,424,29871,29906,29900,29896,29906,29892,12468,1808,712,8556,302,29915,264,1029,787,2331,1436,29875,2535,425,21448,13107,2249,15819
