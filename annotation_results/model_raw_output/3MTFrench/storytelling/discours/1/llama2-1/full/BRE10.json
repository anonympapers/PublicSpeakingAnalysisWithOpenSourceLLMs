The speaker uses historical references to explain the context and significance of the phenomenon they are studying, which adds depth and complexity to their argument.\n\nThe transcript provides several examples of how the speakers' behavior in these urban beaches is influenced by their spatial context. For instance, the speaker notes that the presence of a slope or a difference in level can help people relax in the city. Similarly, the speaker observes that the water provides a sensory experience that helps people feel more liberated.\n\nThroughout the transcript, the speaker uses historical references to explain how these urban beaches have evolved over time and how they have become spaces for relaxation and recreation. For example, the speaker notes that some of the behaviors observed in these spaces are new and unexpected, even surprising. This suggests that the history of these spaces is relevant to understanding their current use.\n\nOverall, the narration in the transcript is pertinent because it provides a nuanced and contextualized explanation of the phenomenon being studied. By drawing on historical references, the speaker is able to provide a more complete and compelling picture of how these urban beaches have come to exist and what they represent.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29906,29889,24962,7890,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,425,15474,362,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,13624,29889,29871,29896,353,365,29915,13624,707,22847,3503,302,29915,342,2331,13499,262,2016,29889,29871,29906,353,22310,4371,13499,262,2016,316,301,29915,13624,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,17043,5582,29920,1190,1171,610,343,715,482,29889,478,681,343,29871,22730,8164,29899,5474,20737,599,29948,2123,868,11387,7890,25238,5582,29920,454,29095,29889,6803,19449,1750,452,17043,19047,2331,29892,274,29915,342,2560,29889,1551,707,2601,296,868,13714,29892,1437,7830,29885,335,29892,553,1301,1078,29892,427,5644,457,8441,634,8171,29892,5646,454,9122,409,1437,29920,370,347,1671,9073,12246,29920,7848,4191,818,425,715,482,29889,8748,6079,1601,29140,316,323,9297,4546,1144,29892,21668,443,5646,868,437,5523,818,1374,1690,290,8146,10440,2298,11468,27153,1750,16067,2058,1465,7814,4213,267,29889,9353,23563,5152,3302,970,29879,18484,782,12796,316,301,29915,14531,29892,966,7537,328,1144,4625,10331,749,818,409,752,9555,4191,818,425,715,482,29892,8532,712,454,13003,302,29915,342,818,3691,4170,2331,818,1757,1875,1671,29889,7747,3435,7015,5152,3302,29899,27048,712,8556,1029,787,16794,29948,966,715,1179,23499,13116,805,609,273,2406,29889,365,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,7199,9030,2257,1750,1465,425,18652,2131,316,7015,3804,1314,29892,9949,6267,7128,362,610,966,7537,328,1144,634,966,282,21167,818,946,381,316,425,29835,29889,11948,10042,5646,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,348,20299,882,316,715,482,592,2970,29920,29899,23088,29973,8748,6079,1465,443,378,29149,6722,425,6316,707,316,2298,427,2298,9577,269,2016,634,6722,3058,267,18554,302,29915,609,2331,301,29915,15693,7002,270,29915,12572,427,11757,2925,29892,23563,3804,1314,409,7845,296,1597,13618,316,17176,29948,29889,8748,19172,276,5695,260,29915,328,1144,316,439,7768,2299,1524,29892,316,1104,30057,4630,6267,14913,634,6267,3999,7689,2575,3302,818,301,29915,14531,782,14419,309,29892,782,899,634,782,9712,29892,634,29202,6701,316,1437,4738,966,27299,21158,634,966,611,453,1862,316,289,475,29892,5646,4191,818,425,715,482,29889,12390,1098,20816,3677,12841,9230,3479,1098,20816,23499,13116,2299,1981,1379,28185,9373,1559,16027,275,2406,610,425,12912,333,2131,29892,454,4313,12161,634,425,337,841,434,544,2108,296,2058,443,385,316,610,17488,1465,10741,715,1179,23499,13116,805,609,273,2406,782,12796,316,301,29915,1466,634,316,425,24228,29889,12390,715,1179,4857,1730,2406,3534,19544,270,29915,1540,760,443,13659,12694,296,818,301,29915,267,3535,970,29892,6722,454,7537,28214,15210,1044,5411,634,1661,20498,882,6683,7289,553,502,1179,316,872,8441,29892,3503,5695,26154,443,13659,297,2487,601,782,14913,29892,12866,1444,452,29835,316,1136,8841,12235,269,13365,296,966,432,986,326,743,454,1437,1365,488,358,29889,478,681,8992,29920,3058,882,20737,9332,29948,1597,8691,316,7015,20299,4110,1465,325,359,4213,267,29889,18410,2708,316,7890,3435,8164,29899,5474,599,743,818,301,29915,1062,29878,5093,29892,3503,2257,3435,2601,743,782,12796,316,301,29915,14531,2535,27299,21158,29892,2181,5000,899,5218,634,611,453,327,316,289,475,29892,634,23563,427,286,473,336,993,8164,29899,5474,270,29915,264,1730,7209,288,643,818,301,29915,29948,5143,29872,17103,29889,8748,6079,425,5582,29920,29899,4346,29875,7890,2970,712,7015,1098,20816,452,325,23510,2331,20498,882,316,7890,29892,634,1661,7890,302,29915,22730,2331,2025,6311,13220,29889,365,29915,267,3535,5246,29202,316,7890,2257,439,29915,309,2453,329,29889,1174,7890,5820,424,29892,7890,286,29915,1351,29920,623,3780,1373,28805,270,29915,348,10741,521,15806,1190,7015,1095,307,1169,13180,1601,22085,9061,29889,478,681,286,29915,1351,29920,623,3780,610,17488,712,553,7877,29948,1860,316,5796,415,545,2535,301,29915,21813,17239,23499,475,29892,260,1808,712,425,285,5903,7018,29892,425,29845,270,29915,1540,282,2016,2123,425,12694,663,316,19666,29892,7890,26
