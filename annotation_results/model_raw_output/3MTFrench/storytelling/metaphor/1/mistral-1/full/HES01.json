The speaker compares the materials to human behaviors and emotions (e.g., \"a material when under pressure of time is like us humans,\" \"I extract a little piece of this material and make it live in an environment where you can find yourself with your car in some countries, water enters, it pushes and resists, it can't take it anymore, then the tension cell of endurance cracks,\" \"but that's not all in life, when you open and close your doors, your trunks, your doors, your trunks, and I wear you down. And I wear you down, but I wear you down, but I wear you down...\"). By using these comparisons, the speaker is able to convey complex ideas related to materials science in a more relatable way for the audience.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,27554,457,543,1203,2342,340,543,2034,19438,949,17969,2422,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,28723,15540,3670,15349,8821,10148,331,28725,5039,28764,462,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,481,23473,634,4224,1415,1415,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,15540,27424,2996,16906,14257,28764,14956,2877,714,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,28725,28705,28750,4346,634,439,12909,1147,3670,955,18880,3639,8821,3551,2422,9886,28733,3007,28406,1702,28735,28723,550,607,435,340,20650,2183,278,361,526,28742,1802,427,1390,340,11844,2877,911,949,1079,543,3264,1405,9886,543,19396,29000,28747,5425,2183,278,412,28747,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,3466,28705,28750,28745,15417,766,450,28764,5672,4224,2422,305,28742,556,267,11109,28705,8668,5248,448,2422,462,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,4709,28824,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,12303,24994,28705,28740,28734,28723,330,10454,267,1182,278,28725,1147,2219,1233,631,20703,340,28705,28734,1289,28705,28750,28725,4517,1233,1431,28764,28733,28728,607,305,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,2422,462,2312,2020,340,8821,1203,2342,1550,18180,28735,28747,11109,28705,28734,327,12184,281,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,28723,28705,28740,327,1700,21065,2366,431,934,25090,2110,28725,5359,634,837,28797,1144,271,697,5497,1672,15300,28723,28705,28750,327,1700,21065,2366,431,8738,872,1397,294,6467,1514,21825,28797,1853,4030,911,837,28797,1144,431,305,28742,720,2459,28745,28793,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,330,20650,28733,28728,607,28320,20620,521,1610,8909,581,3025,268,28742,28797,1079,333,1550,550,607,8477,28764,528,3247,521,1610,8909,581,462,752,2864,3228,550,410,4083,3466,1521,281,28742,4373,556,28725,5359,3670,955,2218,1773,1554,3247,526,28742,269,8159,28725,521,1610,8909,581,11989,1011,543,15802,28717,3222,340,12974,305,28742,324,8462,28725,277,28742,374,521,2552,2470,911,2669,11983,439,15879,2110,6702,13662,28725,1514,28705,28876,15158,1997,1606,28723,351,3950,28725,940,26260,28725,1521,337,264,521,2470,2505,1326,667,309,281,28742,1228,328,4935,911,281,28742,1061,308,440,28725,2218,285,14583,28725,2218,1187,3228,28725,461,28742,17788,645,521,1610,8909,581,911,305,28742,720,9302,11631,28725,1521,427,6370,12216,911,1521,427,285,815,482,28723,16549,2669,364,3950,2218,16906,940,291,340,8466,28705,10456,1550,2316,358,955,3418,28710,28725,461,28742,1585,8582,8052,28725,2218,21226,386,521,9276,959,3734,546,2075,8909,1011,526,28742,1802,14632,340,12823,18592,462,7987,309,281,28742,1228,328,4935,911,462,1305,340,6869,447,482,281,28742,370,19341,1610,8909,581,3025,779,279,2614,462,6350,267,911,543,25509,281,28742,8507,322,482,340,2765,324,28723,14527,462,7579,1827,536,28725,2218,6834,14286,28725,526,28742,374,28733,358,955,2218,26035,28725,461,28742,24679,1022,521,27450,2544,358,581,340,3670,1610,8909,581,28725,2218,462,26035,13686,267,2422,521,14453,14482,11109,16906,8631,20650,16906,17895,10275,4346,10454,267,1776,8861,2422,5813,1606,12429,28725,521,2306,28720,536,305,28742,18500,313,3974,28723,3189,28717,28725,2218,1424,28713,2422,305,28742,23524,911,955,26035,305,28742,23524,28725,543,1776,833,28725,543,3025,7358,267,28725,8273,284,607,331,911,8273,284,607,331,911,955,26035,305,28742,11966,795,412,581,911,462,11310,6508,28725,1521,307,28742,269,12122,3285,28725,12410,543,15802,28717,3222,340,298,28714,4935,911,2505,21726,281,28742,370,2552,2470,28725,1521,277,520,1011,28723,3291,1773,1554,3247,28725,1521,285,815,482,2505,3285,261,14924,28725,1521,15644,267,2771,482,28725,940,358,955,28705,10456,435,427,1776,279,3557,28723,13542,277,28742,374,3670,955,461,28742,1585,8582,8052,28725,543,285,815,482,28725,940,358,955,305,28742,1228,1651,955,2218,21226,386,528,14632,1947,281,28742,7590,1289,2219,1233,631,20703,15053,5408,570,340,305,28742,556,267,340,7817,28733,2243,4110,28389,340,528,2306,3810,361,16065,11844,752,2864,11041,340,26708,28723,16549,998,4539,28764,28725,1521,307,28742,28724,264,3557,955,28705,10456,2422,543,11198,28725,940,358,955,481,3285,340,305,28742,321,8041,3974,340,6423,270,28725,16906,3466,28728,11223,16906,17310,5620,10454,267,25509,28725,16906,3466,28728,11223,16906,17310,5620,10454,267,6350,267,28725,16906,3466,28728,11223,16906,17310,5620,10454,267,25509,28725,16906,3466,28728,11223,16906,17310,5620,10454,267,6350,267,911,2218,16906,3264,28768,797,3228,28723,13542,2218,16906,3264,28768,797,3228,28725,5359,2218,16906,3264,28768,797,3228,28725,5359,2218,16906,3264,28768,797,3228,28725,5359,2218,16906,3264,28768,797,3228,28725,5359,2218,16906,3264,28768,797,3228,28725,5359,2218,16906,3264,28768,797,3228,28725,5359,2218,16906,3264,28768,797,3228,28723,365,1013,28725,16906,305,1730,28764,28725,16906,462,6370,8499,28797,911,26941,28725,1514,285,815,1238,901,831,308,1289,427,1776,361,911,543,854,307,28742,374,3557,15053,1448,262,28723,976,734,28725,4517,15349,1550,334,28742,374,26941,955,543,27824,13861,340,1326,575,309,791,28728,722,4346,1514,18124,697,340,543,21367,412,28725
