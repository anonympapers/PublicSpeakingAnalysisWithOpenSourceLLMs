For instance, the speaker compares the evolution of certain forest ecosystems to going from \"cold mountains\" to \"warmer mountains,\" highlighting the impact of climate change on these systems. This metaphor not only makes the concept clearer but also adds a visual element to it, enhancing the audience's understanding. Additionally, there are other metaphors like \"pouring efforts into protecting forests and biodiversity\" and \"sitting on a huge database of information.\" These metaphors help convey the speaker's passion and dedication towards their research and make the content more engaging for the listeners.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,27554,457,543,1203,2342,340,543,2034,19438,949,17969,2422,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,28723,15540,3670,15349,8821,10148,331,28725,5039,28764,462,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,481,23473,634,4224,1415,1415,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,15540,27424,2996,16906,14257,28764,14956,2877,714,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,28725,28705,28750,4346,634,439,12909,1147,3670,955,18880,3639,8821,3551,2422,9886,28733,3007,28406,1702,28735,28723,550,607,435,340,20650,2183,278,361,526,28742,1802,427,1390,340,11844,2877,911,949,1079,543,3264,1405,9886,543,19396,29000,28747,5425,2183,278,412,28747,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,3466,28705,28750,28745,15417,766,450,28764,5672,4224,2422,305,28742,556,267,11109,28705,8668,5248,448,2422,462,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,4709,28824,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,12303,24994,28705,28740,28734,28723,330,10454,267,1182,278,28725,1147,2219,1233,631,20703,340,28705,28734,1289,28705,28750,28725,4517,1233,1431,28764,28733,28728,607,305,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,2422,462,2312,2020,340,8821,1203,2342,1550,18180,28735,28747,11109,28705,28734,327,12184,281,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,28723,28705,28740,327,1700,21065,2366,431,934,25090,2110,28725,5359,634,837,28797,1144,271,697,5497,1672,15300,28723,28705,28750,327,1700,21065,2366,431,8738,872,1397,294,6467,1514,21825,28797,1853,4030,911,837,28797,1144,431,305,28742,720,2459,28745,28793,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,3291,519,278,521,1863,28706,340,15464,4262,982,581,2881,904,28797,27444,4528,2669,4517,263,1514,261,293,340,8821,2669,26305,28723,976,734,28725,10404,2669,26305,14299,28725,340,15464,4262,982,1375,28725,1289,24688,6753,28725,2218,1776,278,28725,340,543,290,607,331,28725,634,461,1057,603,1053,28725,634,15407,28725,634,701,28718,11619,28725,8466,28705,10456,290,28742,28708,305,28742,992,281,28742,7590,3557,12090,6125,28723,17365,7024,6508,435,637,279,3557,526,3950,3247,28723,334,28742,374,4123,28723,15540,305,28742,4138,440,28725,1514,6269,335,4030,7957,347,14158,14245,340,6125,1289,8639,7236,2144,2219,354,18774,4536,9628,3466,3557,28723,2661,268,28742,494,308,13861,911,4536,16899,749,1514,1683,2089,3025,284,26289,1147,8273,911,1514,2306,28721,28891,1074,955,277,4403,12122,15349,28723,16549,940,13791,28725,2669,8631,18592,3247,955,8466,4536,9628,28725,305,28742,4737,636,340,2306,6336,352,435,3510,279,3557,28723,334,28742,374,2669,364,3950,2218,1773,1554,23913,267,4517,305,28742,2146,3507,1022,23473,19352,2669,1233,1052,3807,1966,3763,270,281,28742,370,1305,340,363,441,24688,1165,1651,28723,16549,462,430,1231,8158,28725,277,28742,374,526,28742,266,435,12122,3557,6783,1493,4427,28723,976,734,28725,4517,955,277,28742,374,3670,1610,262,1550,365,1375,28725,9628,28725,543,18481,28725,1514,11198,1554,1359,278,28725,1514,6717,28725,911,2669,28707,440,28725,28705,10456,8159,28705,28740,28734,8804,955,461,28742,2371,263,1555,9628,6783,977,263,543,2996,28723,8500,28725,2218,435,519,278,3557,481,1369,14661,8466,462,12974,28725,5359,14661,28705,28740,28734,8804,4346,5972,3495,28840,28721,1139,28725,13662,3763,554,594,1514,1233,5832,827,27973,8613,1442,911,305,28742,283,6309,573,8125,3974,2669,11716,536,634,11634,1726,340,15434,28710,340,10441,3763,270,24688,1165,1651,28723,1418,427,1493,5224,940,26260,340,526,3222,5439,2219,354,18774,1289,3432,2448,2669,427,21226,487,340,676,8110,6997,883,28725,3466,16921,543,4664,3974,340,1359,278,1326,1520,412,277,28742,374,1201,267,2669,1710,3807,1289,481,6408,361,1514,2128,28713,28723,16549,2105,2505,676,1011,340,379,24944,28725,1521,337,264,22789,16010,356,268,28742,374,3884,8269,3502,305,28742,1161,2010,28723,3189,28717,28725,4346,462,17465,1375,340,1326,18124,3985,28725,461,28742,1585,901,831,28797,2219,261,9892,2422,543,364,3222,2218,528,15596,6935,4224,28723,1700,14102,4368,340,462,3264,338,581,496,1116,6423,24476,28725,1514,6269,335,4030,7957,2306,2640,434,28797,1966,5088,1147,1514,5100,274,28725,5359,356,676,1011,16921,340,11310,517,1449,1147,1514,1233,5832,827,27973,28723,475,28742,1585,19477,7166,18707,17825,634,2545,3378,340,1016,1442,340,5100,274,28725,21090,4473,1147,3285,281,28742,370,13717,28725,911,2218,1514,11216,408,23154,1231,1442,2422,2219,15053,11807,2624,340,949,25012,28723,475,28742,269,11216,2306,670,279,1514,4514,340,354,18774,2422,462,21894,19255,1182,16700,7166,21090,1442,28725,911,461,28742,1585,5153,1424,4110,481,16249,3164,955,634,319,596,481,11895,3450,274,28705,28740,28740,28823,634,1233,5832,827,27973,8613,3378,7957,1233,3871,28718,28797,3502,634,2120,22320,3285,484,5675,28713,526,28742,494,440,28723,28705,28740,28740,28823,277,28742,374,521,16720,291,4177,466,28320,23604,3160,522,911,940,455,28840,1044,1289,637,281,28742,21240,1683,2089,13212,7166,2562,10273,28797,14661,1043,20515,782,28723,1124,1127,940,26260,462,261,4550,466,634,2128,28713,28725,3466,16921,1514,7581,28840,1377,439,322,4030,481,4536,815,2237,28725,277,28742,374,2669
