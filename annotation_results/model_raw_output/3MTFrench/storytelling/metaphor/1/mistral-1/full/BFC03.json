For instance, \"les tas civils\" is metaphorically described as \"l'ensemble des actes qui concernent votre vie de naissance jusqu'Ã  votre mort,\" emphasizing its significance in the context of jurisdiction and legal identity. Similarly, the speaker refers to the potential loss of rights when crossing borders as \"vos droits seront perdus\" or \"you wouldn't exist juridically.\" These metaphors make the text more engaging and improve overall comprehension.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,27554,457,543,1203,2342,340,543,2034,19438,949,17969,2422,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,28723,15540,3670,15349,8821,10148,331,28725,5039,28764,462,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,481,23473,634,4224,1415,1415,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,15540,27424,2996,16906,14257,28764,14956,2877,714,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,28725,28705,28750,4346,634,439,12909,1147,3670,955,18880,3639,8821,3551,2422,9886,28733,3007,28406,1702,28735,28723,550,607,435,340,20650,2183,278,361,526,28742,1802,427,1390,340,11844,2877,911,949,1079,543,3264,1405,9886,543,19396,29000,28747,5425,2183,278,412,28747,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,3466,28705,28750,28745,15417,766,450,28764,5672,4224,2422,305,28742,556,267,11109,28705,8668,5248,448,2422,462,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,4709,28824,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,12303,24994,28705,28740,28734,28723,330,10454,267,1182,278,28725,1147,2219,1233,631,20703,340,28705,28734,1289,28705,28750,28725,4517,1233,1431,28764,28733,28728,607,305,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,2422,462,2312,2020,340,8821,1203,2342,1550,18180,28735,28747,11109,28705,28734,327,12184,281,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,28723,28705,28740,327,1700,21065,2366,431,934,25090,2110,28725,5359,634,837,28797,1144,271,697,5497,1672,15300,28723,28705,28750,327,1700,21065,2366,431,8738,872,1397,294,6467,1514,21825,28797,1853,4030,911,837,28797,1144,431,305,28742,720,2459,28745,28793,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,16549,955,8159,28733,3222,340,13479,267,1289,12631,22028,28797,269,1550,3291,519,278,12310,6508,911,461,28742,1585,8582,8052,1514,261,293,13269,4544,28723,15540,16906,28725,1521,435,268,28742,357,279,2552,1116,955,340,3588,9907,3974,17093,28723,1618,26286,3974,28725,1514,261,293,13269,4544,28725,277,28742,374,9628,3285,955,28705,10456,28723,334,28742,374,305,28742,1058,28719,982,634,960,274,3025,14055,485,10454,267,11198,340,10454,267,1879,12305,14850,28742,28839,10454,267,5461,28723,3782,28706,340,1879,12305,28725,340,28555,465,28725,340,8738,3781,28725,277,28742,374,10454,267,1253,424,281,28742,1129,3974,12310,313,1651,1147,543,364,3222,5497,297,824,872,28713,16065,1514,3483,1046,955,16906,14257,28764,17369,8466,2505,1043,340,10454,267,11198,28723,9779,6578,340,305,28742,20981,22028,28797,9078,28725,911,3285,16166,1116,2422,462,15004,936,749,28725,277,28742,374,28031,2669,435,3557,11983,28725,435,5497,3557,18874,28797,3076,2741,1116,312,8407,381,281,28742,370,3763,270,521,20638,28723,8693,16906,8738,547,28764,340,5455,343,457,1514,2778,28710,9603,28725,2669,16906,4430,263,10274,12974,2669,1233,28712,4156,2422,521,20638,12429,28725,521,3763,270,1415,24373,340,637,5271,343,426,299,28797,28725,2669,521,1792,381,28797,340,9220,1520,22481,521,960,28706,28725,940,358,526,28742,309,435,10384,3557,1289,637,430,1779,1448,28710,28723,1618,1113,1127,28725,2422,3670,12429,28725,363,385,3483,1046,1201,677,17266,381,28723,550,607,307,28742,720,1330,1022,3285,12310,313,2741,1116,28723,418,28742,308,20524,14286,4817,28706,1289,3763,554,749,11844,23749,274,11846,911,10360,5620,340,26590,6113,2219,2552,28706,6618,2235,634,408,28840,16984,340,28031,28723,15540,16249,1685,28725,521,7245,433,7204,28725,1829,26420,481,4843,28725,543,285,28891,631,1730,28725,5972,264,1071,1238,28725,340,24999,361,7245,433,1415,20687,28725,12800,22034,481,976,27477,28723,1618,16110,955,12310,6508,28725,461,28742,1585,634,575,4544,1289,4128,704,3640,28723,4573,12368,594,5611,274,28725,1514,408,28840,28721,1044,28713,22028,28797,596,28725,1514,10610,1442,28725,1514,8738,5662,340,543,5073,340,10754,340,305,28742,20981,22028,28797,9078,28725,1514,847,2351,4061,274,340,543,5073,22028,28797,9078,28725,634,3483,1046,340,305,28742,11966,1127,28723,6021,1514,364,8668,28725,2218,290,28742,763,28718,412,2669,12823,4323,1514,3483,1046,1415,5963,904,269,22028,28797,269,28723,14527,4128,306,26289,28725,2218,8395,263,1585,10274,2219,5165,15737,883,28723,15540,364,3950,435,3557,14791,263,521,960,28706,4842,1147,462,21894,1201,1022,297,824,872,28725,481,13246,4346,1514,17902,28725,634,3483,1046,8987,1686,4601,28725,3025,435,2669,10613,28052,11983,1003,278,481,4244,28723,935,960,28706,281,28742,2959,270,6259,22028,28797,269,28723,16549,3191,269,307,28742,374,13087,28797,28725,911,6702,521,18124,16728,267,6508,28725,461,28742,494,617,481,26590,11746,462,2800,294,546,18124,16728,267,3913,281,28742,370,22434,11414,28725,1514,936,694,263,634,17902,911,340,305,28742,25538,28725,543,18655,28797,634,3004,381,28723,4709,733,28748,16289,28793,7664,8729,28747,28705,28750,28745,560,272,2078,1203,2489,28725,1424,2366,734,460,1307,11466,298,7282,4630,5648,16582,5202,298,6259,4495,304,652,13828,2673,22902,28723,1263,3335,28725,345,867,261,293,13269,4544,28739,349,1424,27041,1944,5397,390,345,28714,28742,1058,28719,982,634,960,274,3025,4368,308,10454,267,11198,340,1879,12305,14850,28742,28839,10454,267,5461,862,10574,3864,871,18309,297,272,2758,302,21716,
