For instance, the speaker compares the stars to balls of gas that are hot and agitated, which results in their brightness. He also describes the sound of stars as a laugh or a rire, and analyzes the deformation of their light to understand their \"laugh\" and thus their characteristics. The metaphors used help the listener to visualize and better understand the abstract concept of stars and their behavior.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,27554,457,543,1203,2342,340,543,2034,19438,949,17969,2422,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,28723,15540,3670,15349,8821,10148,331,28725,5039,28764,462,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,481,23473,634,4224,1415,1415,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,15540,27424,2996,16906,14257,28764,14956,2877,714,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,28725,28705,28750,4346,634,439,12909,1147,3670,955,18880,3639,8821,3551,2422,9886,28733,3007,28406,1702,28735,28723,550,607,435,340,20650,2183,278,361,526,28742,1802,427,1390,340,11844,2877,911,949,1079,543,3264,1405,9886,543,19396,29000,28747,5425,2183,278,412,28747,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,3466,28705,28750,28745,15417,766,450,28764,5672,4224,2422,305,28742,556,267,11109,28705,8668,5248,448,2422,462,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,4709,28824,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,12303,24994,28705,28740,28734,28723,330,10454,267,1182,278,28725,1147,2219,1233,631,20703,340,28705,28734,1289,28705,28750,28725,4517,1233,1431,28764,28733,28728,607,305,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,2422,462,2312,2020,340,8821,1203,2342,1550,18180,28735,28747,11109,28705,28734,327,12184,281,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,28723,28705,28740,327,1700,21065,2366,431,934,25090,2110,28725,5359,634,837,28797,1144,271,697,5497,1672,15300,28723,28705,28750,327,1700,21065,2366,431,8738,872,1397,294,6467,1514,21825,28797,1853,4030,911,837,28797,1144,431,305,28742,720,2459,28745,28793,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,320,14906,11844,1233,532,3429,26941,28725,8273,427,261,26289,28723,16063,264,13798,298,28710,634,1233,532,3429,3025,268,28742,494,5118,308,28723,17365,14804,1233,434,909,28725,277,28742,374,462,27450,20180,340,6393,28733,966,715,10326,3025,528,305,28742,28708,5271,496,19838,1521,337,264,9628,634,16010,28723,351,3950,28725,8273,934,3557,955,461,28742,1585,5337,340,5598,6702,15349,955,1514,1233,532,3429,8631,3026,425,308,911,2191,27423,28725,2218,757,1554,16906,462,284,518,343,28723,451,12337,749,543,16720,291,340,701,28718,28723,16035,1233,532,546,28725,277,28742,374,2219,16720,291,340,14961,28725,9237,26288,1116,484,5675,340,15053,717,3974,911,19477,15053,12000,2237,28723,2535,11076,340,5408,1046,15103,5497,877,28719,1442,1289,543,5439,634,1233,532,3429,1289,27424,10990,28723,2661,268,28742,316,685,485,2669,1480,1116,4494,6702,521,3191,267,28723,3189,28717,461,28742,494,1555,26765,28725,1514,1233,532,3429,408,1926,2422,462,277,755,28723,16549,15545,1053,2505,28733,5149,28839,1415,408,28876,333,281,28742,269,28722,1549,28723,689,13768,3191,267,2306,1693,340,543,15460,911,340,543,8675,291,340,27424,1233,532,546,911,14632,19477,340,15053,9628,1514,21825,3160,7242,28723,16549,14257,28764,28733,28728,607,28320,936,416,28718,2219,1233,532,546,1550,9187,28725,1253,462,3191,267,307,28742,1061,416,520,28052,543,3636,267,28725,1289,4244,340,8466,462,8414,955,462,1966,435,12122,3557,5455,343,457,28723,1700,17709,8110,481,4497,14455,3557,331,2505,19483,911,940,28728,722,14850,28742,28839,13662,28725,13086,1776,2650,543,2996,28723,13542,1212,2572,340,1776,361,462,3191,267,634,1233,532,3429,1550,1700,3264,1405,934,3466,28710,28723,15540,23913,267,1514,1233,532,3429,28725,461,28742,28149,331,543,23500,266,7286,543,17709,8110,526,28742,3222,427,1424,424,28725,4536,28733,28724,2422,462,12974,28725,1253,8821,2306,1517,312,1134,21056,10441,3191,267,28725,3025,6783,10274,528,6419,331,9908,1147,10441,21825,28797,1853,1651,28723,17365,13138,362,573,28725,277,28742,374,305,28742,529,18285,28733,28713,1443,7851,28723,9801,290,28742,28708,8052,940,26260,955,462,11150,309,28725,459,267,2218,1802,1233,532,546,28725,934,15053,9628,28723,13718,28718,2126,28733,28707,28733,309,1289,3191,267,481,11198,425,28438,1550,15800,309,28839,28725,13662,940,28728,1053,2505,277,24627,340,4128,306,26289,28723,475,28742,28149,331,305,28742,271,536,634,11198,11619,1233,532,3429,2669,724,4652,9043,305,28742,8507,2100,340,459,267,2218,1802,11150,309,28723,15540,277,4403,28725,461,28742,1585,18707,17825,634,11198,1554,11150,309,2422,462,277,755,28723,550,607,7705,28764,8466,3670,1326,27450,10760,28840,4110,752,410,1289,305,28742,28952,309,28725,5359,2669,319,23862,1415,12974,28725,461,28742,1858,864,549,329,14924,1514,949,25012,1415,20659,867,28717,2599,22046,28725,25648,452,10024,340,543,26164,28723,3291,519,278,7372,373,364,28797,521,11408,755,7808,788,2669,2306,424,310,263,1514,11198,1554,11150,309,940,3589,1514,28705,28750,28734,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,1233,532,3429,955,25648,452,2923,14631,911,461,28742,269,11216,5442,8269,3285,340,28705,28750,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,28723,6624,440,1326,4574,4296,324,28725,461,28742,1585,21974,28797,11844,949,25012,911,461,28742,1585,4052,481,16249,3164,6935,2765,1238,1672,15300,2669,459,267,11150,309,28723,1337,3285,22124,28725,277,28742,374,526,28742,309,3688,1289,13686,267,11997,466,28725,5359,1521,2669,10613,11631,24999,361,6702,25386,11844,11198,11619,1233,532,3429,3025,5922,366,46
