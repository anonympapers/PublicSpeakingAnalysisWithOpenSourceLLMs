For instance, \"challenging climatic conditions are no longer just an environmental problem but an economic, social, and security issue for humanity.\" The speaker also uses the metaphor of \"levers\" to explain how various factors can be acted upon to reduce emissions. Additionally, the use of phrases like \"great paradox,\" \"following a certain strategy,\" and \"combining the 5 leviers\" adds depth and clarity to the speaker's argument. Overall, the metaphors employed in the transcription enhance the explanation and make it more engaging for the audience.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,27554,457,543,1203,2342,340,543,2034,19438,949,17969,2422,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,28723,15540,3670,15349,8821,10148,331,28725,5039,28764,462,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,481,23473,634,4224,1415,1415,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,15540,27424,2996,16906,14257,28764,14956,2877,714,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,28725,28705,28750,4346,634,439,12909,1147,3670,955,18880,3639,8821,3551,2422,9886,28733,3007,28406,1702,28735,28723,550,607,435,340,20650,2183,278,361,526,28742,1802,427,1390,340,11844,2877,911,949,1079,543,3264,1405,9886,543,19396,29000,28747,5425,2183,278,412,28747,28705,28734,28725,28705,28740,3466,28705,28750,28745,15417,766,450,28764,5672,4224,2422,305,28742,556,267,11109,28705,8668,5248,448,2422,462,1186,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,28723,4709,28824,12171,1702,3384,28737,896,12303,24994,28705,28740,28734,28723,330,10454,267,1182,278,28725,1147,2219,1233,631,20703,340,28705,28734,1289,28705,28750,28725,4517,1233,1431,28764,28733,28728,607,305,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,2422,462,2312,2020,340,8821,1203,2342,1550,18180,28735,28747,11109,28705,28734,327,12184,281,28742,1858,5463,340,21065,377,2124,411,28723,28705,28740,327,1700,21065,2366,431,934,25090,2110,28725,5359,634,837,28797,1144,271,697,5497,1672,15300,28723,28705,28750,327,1700,21065,2366,431,8738,872,1397,294,6467,1514,21825,28797,1853,4030,911,837,28797,1144,431,305,28742,720,2459,28745,28793,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,5497,635,1442,3285,3466,17775,1863,1116,1289,459,267,2306,1693,617,931,2959,9606,2422,1514,1203,2729,3025,13662,6884,10320,28711,3160,2561,1289,2219,295,869,1233,783,278,1415,284,2959,9606,911,7286,1514,1233,28719,5091,5088,308,459,267,268,440,28797,911,543,16888,3974,1415,6423,270,28723,13193,4274,340,305,28742,1061,3639,28725,462,484,282,1116,6423,24476,307,28742,374,3285,526,28742,370,3588,430,1231,8158,14453,14482,282,28723,334,28742,374,521,2306,7971,1233,2868,1651,2809,2669,543,5881,833,911,543,7553,1352,3974,27863,5731,911,543,5231,412,281,28742,1802,11807,13861,340,305,28742,18529,3974,28723,976,734,526,28742,309,3586,554,10613,2132,1685,462,3264,28768,7397,466,6935,340,820,1442,2669,16249,1685,1514,284,3053,1102,14177,2119,13662,1217,677,8466,28031,3502,1514,14956,340,820,1442,28723,13193,4644,955,1514,3763,1449,3116,308,17951,2536,357,4485,28723,16549,16906,528,3247,28764,5029,28797,28710,340,543,16214,340,5465,28725,281,28742,1802,6561,512,28797,5731,911,281,28742,1802,12264,340,543,3636,267,28725,13662,28725,356,934,26260,5731,28723,13542,9628,28725,8159,274,3557,363,520,2487,28723,14527,459,267,23863,7093,462,3285,1233,2243,424,324,28725,1514,1203,2729,28725,1514,1233,28719,5091,10274,20836,308,911,11844,14956,23551,9603,16010,28723,16549,2422,462,10274,12974,28725,356,264,26340,28797,305,28742,1379,685,28723,1418,363,864,16018,552,1555,543,14214,3974,1253,15600,1289,28705,28750,28734,28782,28734,28725,3670,3025,5475,1651,28705,28734,1233,28719,5091,2422,1514,1203,2729,28723,320,406,462,562,340,4128,306,26289,934,340,23913,267,4517,438,424,501,340,8821,1928,335,28723,15540,277,4403,28725,461,28742,28149,331,305,28742,8507,2100,1455,28797,634,1233,28719,5091,911,4517,8273,2669,10613,5922,1116,17724,3807,1289,305,28742,3146,361,28725,481,3763,554,3906,1514,752,2864,11041,340,11450,495,281,28742,2650,28705,28750,28734,28782,28734,28723,15540,10148,457,305,28742,8507,2100,634,1233,28719,5091,28725,2218,26286,864,2219,2306,675,3640,481,28705,28782,3586,28775,424,1726,1949,2741,270,12843,28725,3025,5497,28705,28782,16100,3378,1147,1514,364,8668,356,12122,717,361,2669,287,1555,457,1514,1233,28719,5091,28723,2661,337,264,20192,543,11323,352,340,305,28742,316,28719,4539,6209,28725,462,18778,3502,634,14855,17775,1233,2243,424,1726,6702,462,5835,911,462,20249,731,28725,462,24515,324,1003,452,815,465,634,20249,28716,294,2464,28725,20192,4213,462,1001,28733,1061,324,465,28725,2219,24515,482,1397,294,323,3974,1233,1079,28721,2959,1651,481,26601,1116,634,20249,28716,294,2464,347,14158,14245,3285,19416,1442,911,3285,1083,481,1233,1079,10955,28723,13542,481,3013,28725,481,2268,440,281,28742,28797,1079,10955,2669,3557,457,1415,284,2959,9606,1289,543,24622,3974,1233,844,15663,28725,24483,9617,13139,3466,818,28710,476,555,28723,6068,6085,13390,3913,462,1455,28797,911,462,2765,324,11895,267,521,3487,15904,1142,28723,976,734,955,940,462,1455,28797,28725,277,28742,374,543,1493,5224,340,6209,3025,264,462,3285,1949,2741,28797,305,28742,8507,2100,634,1233,28719,5091,28725,3670,462,14895,8159,15053,12631,305,28742,3710,299,340,19885,2034,19438,1289,305,28742,2902,28723,9779,11387,536,28725,462,2265,1116,281,28742,28797,1079,10955,307,28742,28708,19932,955,15053,12631,281,28742,6610,299,940,462,1455,28797,28723,16549,277,28742,374,1147,28707,406,26941,340,15434,267,1289,305,28742,3146,361,28725,6702,462,8159,543,27857,4970,412,27125,883,28725,3546,982,19477,521,940,278,15053,6599,364,28797,28723,1618,262
