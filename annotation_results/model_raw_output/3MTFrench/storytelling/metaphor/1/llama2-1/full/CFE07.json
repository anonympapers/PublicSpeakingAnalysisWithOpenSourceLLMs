The speaker uses metaphors to explain complex ideas and to make their message more engaging and memorable.\n\nOption 1: The speaker uses metaphors sparingly and mainly for illustrative purposes.\n\nThe speaker uses two metaphors in the transcript: \"Madéernel\" and \"l'éterrature de Genes\". The use of these metaphors is limited to providing examples or analogies to help explain complex ideas. For instance, the speaker uses the metaphor of a key to explain how their guide works, and they use the metaphor of a book to illustrate the concept of comprehension. These metaphors are used to clarify and simplify the message, but they are not central to the speaker's argument.\n\nOption 2: The speaker uses metaphors extensively and creatively to enhance their message.\n\nThe speaker uses metaphors throughout the transcript to create vivid imagery and to make their message more engaging. For example, when explaining how their guide works, the speaker uses the metaphor of a toolbox to describe the different components of their approach. They also use the metaphor of a journey to describe the process of learning and development. These metaphors are used to create a sense of movement and progression, and they help to convey the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for their work.\n\nOption 3: The speaker uses metaphors in a creative and innovative way to challenge conventional thinking.\n\nThe speaker uses metaphors in a unique and original way to challenge conventional thinking and to offer fresh perspectives on educational issues. For example, when discussing the importance of comprehension, the speaker uses the metaphor of a puzzle to illustrate how understanding is essential for learning. This metaphor is used to highlight the complexity of the learning process and to emphasize the importance of comprehension in achieving academic success. Overall, the speaker's use of metaphors in this transcript is creative, innovative, and effectively conveys their
