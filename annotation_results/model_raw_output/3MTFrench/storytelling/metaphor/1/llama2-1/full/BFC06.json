{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-10T10:33:50.46527228Z","response":"\nBased on the provided transcript, I will analyze it in relation to the questionnaire. For each question, I will choose one of the options (0, 1, or 2) and provide a brief explanation for my choice.\n\nQuestion 1: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you rate the use of metaphors in the transcription?\n\nOption chosen: 2 - The metaphor is used effectively to describe the characteristics and improve the explanation.\n\nThe transcript uses metaphors throughout to create vivid imagery and enhance the explanation of the scene. For example, the \"african dawn\" and \"animals of the savanna\" are used to create a sense of place and atmosphere, while the \"new prince\" is a metaphor for Simba's birth. The use of these metaphors helps to make the scene more engaging and memorable for the audience.\n\nQuestion 2: Imagine you are the Sainte of the scene. How would you present the newborn Simba to the community?\n\nOption chosen: 1 - The Sainte would present Simba in a way that highlights his belonging to the community.\n\nAs the Sainte, I would present Simba to the community in a way that emphasizes his belonging and connection to the savanna and its inhabitants. I would use language that emphasizes the importance of Simba's birth as a communal event, such as \"tous les membres de la communauté sont convocés\" (all members of the community are invited). This would help to reinforce the idea that Simba's birth is not just a personal event, but a collective one that brings the entire community together.\n\nQuestion 3: How do you think the absence of support from family members affects the young mothers?\n\nOption chosen: 2 - The absence of support from family members has significant effects on the young mothers' psychological well-being and relationships.\n\nThe transcript suggests that the absence of support from family members can have a significant impact on the young mothers' mental health and relationships. For example, it states that \"les raisons sont multiples et partis\" (the reasons are multiple and varied), which could indicate that the lack of support is due to various factors, such as geographical distance or conflicting priorities. Additionally, the transcript notes that the young mothers may experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, which could further highlight the importance of having a supportive network during this time.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,17043,5582,29920,3058,882,553,269,4167,6836,286,3610,272,5481,575,634,425,8861,20244,29892,14344,316,425,1055,9948,316,3439,2291,2535,5278,22577,15188,904,1089,29887,275,424,868,11412,316,425,6316,29889,1588,1540,29920,7732,1473,267,19397,623,7367,5278,20244,29892,282,30037,344,301,29915,351,1171,22781,29892,454,14419,309,409,301,15792,29892,425,269,29915,485,663,263,18961,457,634,9411,966,3778,2993,316,425,269,29915,3496,276,564,374,794,316,5646,610,1671,1035,434,453,381,425,9367,868,13164,15927,29889,341,5093,966,10359,30037,5888,17508,375,3435,18916,1671,409,883,333,519,634,6003,375,29889,4241,841,424,1444,7890,16193,1597,18768,1873,29889,1954,22094,29920,29892,2257,6701,17541,2093,3435,9411,966,3778,2993,316,425,4048,11276,634,7209,1153,7241,6578,1671,938,27083,261,3439,2291,818,425,28812,2535,1027,2037,29442,19874,29874,634,872,1153,10993,966,11825,316,3439,2291,29889,838,943,15237,5695,6079,1577,10050,29892,373,707,270,29915,5753,536,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,712,425,29580,371,21865,1572,868,12536,424,818,8121,261,443,17889,1465,454,3060,861,316,1601,29140,316,266,17449,29892,1444,325,1759,16134,424,7890,425,5814,5893,29889,422,1004,373,454,24722,1465,425,29580,371,316,425,5273,9948,316,3439,2291,29892,316,6003,381,11825,634,818,2723,453,1908,443,289,10126,29948,707,443,10019,1690,882,3817,1300,5218,29889,323,681,966,18490,316,425,28812,3435,7602,542,2406,29889,997,11449,29892,966,626,275,3503,5695,8648,966,29758,1144,29889,838,943,8556,5820,787,8997,316,872,18097,6701,270,29915,18704,712,301,29915,5903,1690,882,316,425,5273,9948,707,21617,29884,316,24145,19513,17543,744,443,10019,1690,882,4348,2491,782,1791,21867,782,7303,29889,2664,22114,11825,316,2257,3435,316,610,13258,275,452,2453,352,296,2331,316,15470,4595,29899,862,1237,29889,1459,16132,11797,3435,904,417,647,743,10505,1946,8105,882,316,10713,21038,29889,2664,1153,14125,3435,2473,2701,634,760,275,1354,20423,7848,712,966,29026,11825,409,5663,283,794,20536,1671,316,15470,11825,818,2723,453,1908,634,23532,1487,7431,2310,475,316,6267,289,10126,29948,29889,422,1004,1465,1597,266,17449,29892,373,452,8164,2331,5646,9073,29892,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,263,4370,1437,4387,29948,966,1801,1691,868,11482,1300,316,13267,819,1832,616,1190,454,316,15470,21428,29889,1281,4838,882,29892,439,1379,1801,1691,343,1078,269,29915,309,1190,966,29026,21428,7628,339,29915,1808,302,29915,342,2331,2793,1190,966,18490,316,6267,11449,427,316,29882,943,316,6267,378,12090,29892,7628,339,29915,1808,2906,7081,21428,29889,6803,269,29915,264,904,2608,29948,9073,29892,1444,592,26099,26842,404,29948,818,301,29915,29948,4068,316,6267,2852,481,347,11643,1387,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,29892,818,6267,19666,316,1437,2590,634,270,29915,264,5389,7342,782,9587,868,8714,634,8648,818,301,29915,29948,4068,316,425,4021,2131,553,5302,29889,1281,29926,688,744,29892,3847,284,634,1832,616,29889,9353,5278,1203,361,29892,1444,26099,599,29948,782,2432,25123,316,29871,29941,29945,29026,11825,29892,553,4832,3031,13116,782,29871,29896,29900,2123,11387,316,6267,289,10126,29948,29889,435,29915,1794,1757,29948,553,9953,2406,270,29915,264,17124,6609,29892,16623,2331,7015,5155,1056,2658,634,12036,261,553,5697,1169,12298,270,29915,1639,2467,1832,616,29889,435,29915,1794,443,269,29915,29891,3708,24984,29871,29906,29945,29900,1998,3246,818,2432,25123,29889,6803,9073,18475,441,381,966,12694,2063,29892,432,29915,1794,8572,29948,1601,904,13775,12794,316,29871,29941,29945,
