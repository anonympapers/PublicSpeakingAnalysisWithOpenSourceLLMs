The speaker uses metaphors to explain complex concepts, such as the comparison of enzymes to little elves and the comparison of catalysts to old cars. However, the speaker also provides clear explanations and definitions for each term, which helps to clarify any confusion. Therefore, I will score the usage of metaphors in this transcript as a 1 (somewhat used).\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n0 = Not used at all.\n1 = Somewhat used (as in this case).\n2 = Used effectively to enhance explanation and
