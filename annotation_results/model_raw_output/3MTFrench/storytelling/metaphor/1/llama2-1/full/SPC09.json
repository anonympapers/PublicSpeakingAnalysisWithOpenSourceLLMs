For example, the comparison of an airplane's components to a library and the use of the metaphor of an ark to describe the importance of rapid analysis are both creative and helpful in understanding the topic at hand. The speaker also uses the metaphor of an index to explain how they have reduced the amount of data analyzed in order to find relevant information quickly. Overall, the use of metaphors in this transcript is well done and enhances the listener's understanding of the material.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,425,5722,5458,1871,15819,8556,14924,270,29915,5474,9411,553,1051,22297,634,553,7175,7869,966,3105,1973,29889,4432,475,29892,425,5722,5458,1871,15819,2504,27280,316,9073,25595,358,634,818,325,23469,16784,2459,439,29915,1808,263,13260,8501,1671,25238,13639,301,29915,16063,473,782,3248,301,29915,6921,10042,454,28439,29889,29871,30219,29874,29892,432,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,409,610,1358,2298,11364,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,29871,4277,24853,2298,11364,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,966,269,882,7890,610,1358,316,425,7019,2764,2131,13977,327,1387,29889,997,301,2487,290,1808,263,4894,264,29892,373,8164,2852,566,631,301,29915,13624,270,29915,348,1029,291,29889,3387,29872,7907,29892,1487,472,357,5606,269,482,29892,3503,2331,25235,25595,358,1671,7175,7869,29889,6101,1487,410,14153,1700,29892,2085,424,443,5161,802,2123,2331,29889,435,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,409,1518,492,7808,6628,1314,29889,853,1029,291,270,29915,29948,3473,484,29892,27905,553,2298,4224,326,488,2117,371,332,1750,263,1072,22715,21394,270,29915,262,689,800,1190,9411,966,5541,1934,29892,1190,9411,7015,5541,1934,29889,6803,7890,27516,1597,1178,1318,29892,7907,23422,1597,540,545,270,29915,29948,345,1924,29892,373,766,10120,553,2298,270,29915,2487,290,3533,29875,3163,270,29915,1690,1590,690,818,21557,261,29889,315,29915,342,443,4880,269,29915,29948,880,1089,29889,1551,263,2002,301,29915,326,2590,270,29915,4582,1524,782,5246,1597,904,12324,29872,11721,6539,29892,5644,262,316,29869,818,22272,634,818,16455,643,29889,9353,7015,3533,29875,3163,270,29915,2487,290,29876,743,29892,373,14954,344,454,9122,553,269,30000,793,1750,2653,19047,7848,12536,743,818,553,20299,4110,818,6056,2993,29889,1459,17488,29892,443,923,4900,29899,264,29899,1182,681,802,29892,553,5694,1064,3698,29892,2123,553,3965,1080,1750,452,4079,7199,9030,439,29915,348,553,5541,1934,707,427,9703,29889,997,23520,553,20299,4110,818,6056,2993,707,1465,5278,13483,4323,2131,316,1661,29899,29876,743,29892,302,29915,342,2331,1044,27751,2331,1950,29889,7740,424,439,29915,1808,1029,291,29892,373,707,16374,1841,1595,381,443,13164,29889,11948,2331,553,282,3270,1912,2730,305,5908,970,29879,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,279,1173,10505,1647,29899,6972,993,29889,853,553,1203,10270,553,1775,743,29892,707,553,5178,2719,1749,267,553,13698,316,16455,344,25595,29889,6803,966,9073,29892,432,29915,1794,286,29915,262,1028,533,443,5190,270,29915,1540,1178,1318,29889,12545,634,6366,815,29892,443,2380,29889,1551,707,9411,818,301,29915,29948,10936,29889,1551,263,28643,443,2380,1671,17124,4630,25595,358,966,19313,29892,7209,289,1759,787,29892,553,22272,29892,301,29915,5128,6617,875,631,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,4422,895,966,286,30037,4467,3420,267,29889,435,29915,1794,1841,700,277,425,4323,2131,553,21880,3483,952,2406,1671,534,8885,25595,358,966,19313,1750,8556,26842,404,296,29889,435,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,12866,1671,10628,7869,553,13698,553,878,30000,793,5844,2249,19669,29892,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,337,4926,29892,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,454,878,15340,5844,2249,15819,29892,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,9484,261,553,878,30000,793,5844,2249,19669,1671,454,878,15340,5844,2249,15819,29892,5566,1509,29899,4346,29875,29892,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,1020,1524,553,21880,553,21880,553,21880,2653,790,743,29889,315,29915,342,425,1178,1318,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,2831,445,7418,29892,306,674,367,773,278,4944,1301,924,408,1881,322,22
