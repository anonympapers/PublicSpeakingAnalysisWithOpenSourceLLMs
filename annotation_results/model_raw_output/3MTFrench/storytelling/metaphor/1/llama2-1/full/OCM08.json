The speaker uses several metaphors throughout the text to explain complex concepts and ideas. For example, they compare the act of implanting businesses in Africa to a \"facilitator\" and \"organizer,\" respectively. They also use the metaphor of a \"rainbow\" to describe the different aspects of their research project. These metaphors help to make the explanation more vivid and memorable, thus improving the overall clarity of the discourse.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,11948,270,29915,348,286,17914,29892,980,343,263,16573,270,29915,348,2432,293,631,29892,966,29871,29896,29946,2852,1446,263,1341,293,2708,18490,316,301,29915,29909,8028,317,4519,15777,715,787,743,1465,1597,15258,634,24379,2016,2181,895,23837,1387,634,22347,1908,29889,2664,25226,17459,800,1190,966,373,1338,3984,296,427,2058,1671,6896,2736,276,5278,2181,895,29892,302,29915,609,2331,868,5646,27666,425,6896,499,271,707,29899,346,4191,260,29915,267,29889,1720,285,9864,277,8532,818,21384,270,29915,1808,29892,818,269,29915,264,2970,454,10784,271,11099,333,1387,553,2756,7147,29892,18729,707,818,260,29915,262,5903,8270,29889,315,29915,342,443,274,309,29889,951,29871,29896,29955,4725,290,1030,29871,29896,29929,29892,29871,29896,29929,29929,29900,29892,301,29915,627,29872,9090,29872,1671,11172,17950,316,19513,7825,21101,707,553,2318,267,9619,296,7147,23837,3783,818,4370,9332,29948,610,966,2852,1446,5932,743,29889,951,13295,1044,29872,29892,1671,270,29915,370,29948,29920,427,316,639,1454,1860,29892,316,5400,2131,29892,3503,26154,316,8525,29875,7019,2764,2131,818,4370,1841,1730,29948,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29946,29889,11948,270,29915,30057,4467,634,4473,8894,29892,818,2257,380,1943,316,611,5814,9233,29892,1444,29758,316,23778,818,23563,25763,7890,409,2970,29892,9360,29892,3503,4177,29892,3503,270,29915,29877,30071,8556,325,993,2257,6094,290,2535,1120,424,316,439,7768,301,29915,1466,10752,21216,29973,18637,29991,319,22259,2131,29892,980,343,263,325,336,2073,316,439,7768,409,1539,2484,427,784,1908,29889,1704,29892,301,29915,627,29872,4555,1444,7890,610,280,29892,302,29915,342,443,20744,5541,29948,712,316,29871,29929,29871,29906,29900,29906,29900,7456,29889,29871,29929,29871,29906,29900,29906,29900,5879,277,3012,1387,1671,6367,533,634,2894,11728,29889,365,29915,11236,2131,553,5374,28141,7825,21101,270,29915,348,29871,29906,29892,29946,29906,29900,634,443,3455,2512,29889,1105,277,29892,29871,29906,29892,29955,29955,29906,14746,316,1136,3011,14075,29892,10890,9619,1169,2298,316,29871,29906,29945,29995,316,425,4665,3001,316,301,29915,3470,522,29872,285,786,344,29899,29882,653,484,29889,319,16474,29892,3503,270,29915,348,316,4883,274,13805,29892,270,29915,348,4883,410,27499,316,23520,29892,1444,592,1139,484,29889,438,1481,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,1671,4048,6390,634,7199,9030,29892,1354,2257,28476,29872,13547,439,29915,309,409,22847,29892,707,443,29188,316,16089,1524,301,29915,13699,424,362,316,325,359,23440,4637,1190,454,25523,263,1341,293,475,634,443,6701,260,30057,865,29889,383,1351,29920,29899,23088,6896,29948,1358,439,7768,7209,8288,712,6267,25732,24858,6367,7565,634,6121,29889,2581,592,26427,29892,1354,2257,28476,29872,29892,13547,712,432,29915,17345,9030,454,282,30037,484,29892,707,443,29188,316,325,359,1223,9945,427,610,29888,1249,267,409,1810,7719,11099,333,3783,634,6577,11477,533,1190,454,22922,263,1341,293,475,29889,23816,26350,29892,678,837,968,29892,872,1826,316,7890,427,7890,364,1975,19468,634,4021,2131,270,29915,2749,11992,29892,9565,4664,1004,427,1040,9474,29892,1444,1791,1759,301,29915,2611,424,260,29915,1794,29892,3440,3856,712,5291,408,29892,3440,7890,7890,18593,5695,316,1773,4279,316,1006,9102,800,610,13659,818,425,4180,316,15093,1044,29872,29892,3503,1444,7890,626,558,347,29889,2581,7890,626,558,347,29889,2581,7890,427,7468,553,18475,2863,316,760,29889,2581,452,301,29915,1794,2331,301,29915,459,1893,2049,533,29892,1444,452,289,21167,1759,6701,2331,316,26814,15373,347,29889,6803,339
