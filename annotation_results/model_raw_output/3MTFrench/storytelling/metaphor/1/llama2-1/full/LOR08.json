The metaphors are used to explain complex concepts, such as the evolution of forests towards warmer climates, and the impact of human activities on forest biodiversity. The speaker also uses metaphors to highlight the importance of protecting the forest and its biodiversity, using phrases such as \"Ã§a marche\" (it works) to convey the idea that the efforts to protect the forest are effective.\n\nOverall, the use of metaphors in the speech is effective in improving explanation and description of complex concepts related to forest ecosystems and climate change.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,26099,443,1513,29872,316,10928,9874,569,585,427,18644,29948,23662,1671,3440,261,966,260,294,316,5278,1671,23469,29889,838,943,29892,7814,1671,23469,7691,29892,316,10928,9874,569,819,29892,818,24618,5561,29892,1444,29758,29892,316,425,286,681,344,29892,553,432,1160,647,787,29892,553,14202,29892,553,20491,7545,29892,5646,29871,4277,286,29915,29874,301,29915,1466,270,29915,12572,2331,9201,4439,29889,10793,8955,2488,452,872,277,2331,439,7768,2970,29889,315,29915,342,4226,29889,6803,301,29915,2611,424,29892,966,9638,361,3783,4625,21394,316,4439,818,4048,6390,1354,1597,363,11992,2947,6079,2123,2331,29889,1720,269,29915,485,296,8691,634,2947,8092,631,966,1757,3302,1750,282,17449,1190,4875,634,966,1437,29887,30057,1372,712,18729,8164,9073,29889,11948,610,8474,29892,1671,19397,2970,712,5646,2947,6079,29892,301,29915,6897,663,316,1437,5105,362,452,9378,277,2331,29889,315,29915,342,1671,339,7768,1444,2453,1314,7199,9030,3440,301,29915,3470,6698,1249,18165,21941,1671,904,791,2853,1487,2852,271,270,29915,348,1298,316,15911,904,21553,1387,29889,11948,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,265,452,8164,2331,3911,1261,3825,29889,838,943,29892,3440,712,274,29915,342,2257,1775,262,1577,26219,29892,6079,29892,425,11449,29892,966,6316,1314,23734,29892,966,7075,29892,634,1671,29873,424,29892,29871,4277,5246,29871,29896,29900,6063,712,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,6079,3911,926,261,425,1139,29889,8396,29892,1444,452,26099,2331,427,1243,8997,5646,454,8714,29892,3503,8997,29871,29896,29900,6063,2535,4883,5321,20608,1041,29892,8556,2852,566,1080,966,904,3944,858,19503,13569,743,634,301,29915,279,5365,356,6894,2131,1671,6787,533,553,12266,1295,316,480,8107,316,6267,2852,271,904,21553,1387,29889,1551,409,26427,610,17488,316,25178,7101,1597,363,11992,818,3008,28230,1671,409,13942,29877,2496,316,26722,5994,744,29892,2123,10440,425,4323,2131,316,23734,1601,1056,347,274,29915,342,724,276,1671,2145,2853,818,427,4018,381,966,25999,29889,11948,3700,782,767,802,316,17043,9948,29892,980,343,263,13545,8595,373,269,29915,342,10733,29948,1224,301,29915,20523,479,29889,3872,29883,29892,2535,454,13267,819,316,1601,25740,29892,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,1597,260,5340,1465,22025,1444,592,18593,4239,5155,29889,997,8861,5932,316,454,1841,305,28411,882,10784,15819,29892,966,9638,361,3783,4625,1437,3712,509,29948,1487,10879,1190,966,715,3794,29892,3503,373,767,802,10440,316,6896,19718,1190,966,904,3944,858,19503,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,4370,14954,11555,553,3533,4285,316,1104,743,316,715,3794,29892,12036,2406,1190,2298,270,29915,348,8115,29892,634,1444,966,7468,364,465,1590,4237,1465,1597,9577,6815,2967,316,21880,29889,435,29915,264,7468,1437,700,277,966,4072,316,363,11992,1465,27612,11797,23997,4370,12036,743,29892,634,432,29915,1794,2653,1539,2484,427,10019,5084,712,553,26943,427,7629,4211,267,29871,29896,29896,29995,553,904,3944,858,19503,13569,4285,4625,29378,27478,1224,553,2316,13805,2298,10329,566,29879,439,29915,26608,29889,29871,29896,29896,29995,274,29915,342,443,16380,280,874,882,20737,16133,6947,569,634,610,497,30000,944,818,872,270,29915,14559,1757,3302,7905,4370,2893,29792,8997,1472,27761,29889,422,1004,610,17488,454,260,465,882,553,25999,29892,2123,10440,966,5152,17893,429,327,3783,427,2947,790,1647,29892,274,29915,342,1671,339,7768,8997,966,8595,29871,29929,29900,29892,301,29915,15654,8556,18332,553,1203,10270,634,966,19966,575,270,29915,351,381,29889,2664,13569,4285,1539,29873,296,12866,427,2058,553,8820,1190,454,28
