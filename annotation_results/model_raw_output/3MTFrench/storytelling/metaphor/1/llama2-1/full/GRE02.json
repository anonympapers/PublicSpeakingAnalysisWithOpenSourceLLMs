{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-10T17:01:15.377756626Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I will answer the questionnaire as follows:\n\nQuestion 10: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you rate the use of metaphors in the discourse of this transcription?\n\nOption chosen: 2. The speaker uses metaphors effectively to describe complex anatomical concepts and to make them more understandable for the audience. The use of Flatland as a metaphor to explain the concept of dimensions is particularly creative and helps to illustrate the difficulty of visualizing a third dimension. The speaker's intention to fusionner, or combine, the information from multiple cameras to create a more accurate representation of the student's movements is also an effective use of metaphor. Overall, the speaker's use of metaphors in this transcript is well-executed and helps to enhance the audience's understanding of the topic.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,7890,610,1358,1465,301,29915,29882,2147,904,699,495,818,2155,5080,13896,1501,427,29871,29896,29947,29929,29946,29889,7747,20207,29892,872,26436,12151,28328,2123,454,2174,29886,29948,29892,634,980,2947,7890,953,29885,759,1465,443,4946,427,4239,13391,29889,1954,22094,29920,29899,23088,443,9122,13162,23855,882,18870,29892,2123,16165,370,568,553,15570,787,29892,4224,2749,743,29892,553,5147,7799,29889,853,8694,29892,454,13911,333,819,316,7015,29871,30037,5888,22906,361,3783,707,16380,280,874,29948,610,443,10019,1690,882,297,27601,29884,29892,443,2852,307,4026,1700,398,1387,818,3681,29889,1720,269,29915,342,23428,4600,634,2947,623,9555,2535,3911,301,29915,333,1318,270,29915,1540,22448,9927,29889,438,1481,29892,7890,286,29915,1351,29920,6079,875,355,29884,1597,22448,9927,29889,8748,1444,7175,29888,1908,7890,2970,712,5278,15217,2947,7848,9577,2923,25123,818,1274,13300,357,29889,461,10628,7869,1597,9927,439,29915,265,452,24722,2331,29973,10016,9927,439,29915,265,966,6701,2331,269,30095,29878,316,19397,7604,7608,29889,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,2393,8105,882,454,16151,316,11482,275,29892,782,13295,3435,1970,898,743,966,2852,4749,1934,427,385,8678,347,29889,1720,24722,553,3581,567,385,8678,3783,427,4239,13391,29892,634,437,27649,409,12450,5893,454,5646,427,7732,13391,29889,2169,19755,29920,26814,29899,280,29889,1954,22094,29920,29899,23088,966,1616,293,8250,29892,966,1437,29887,30057,1372,29899,29885,787,29892,13612,2663,29920,443,28710,17948,316,2117,2911,2658,7209,24988,1004,29892,316,1840,1475,373,1056,2658,29899,29894,852,29892,316,274,747,276,2301,1810,5218,29889,4241,841,424,29892,14034,29920,29899,23088,12563,5278,4280,2131,427,25924,2535,966,640,5270,3163,16530,7147,29892,425,2654,898,749,2301,1810,5218,634,966,5039,7719,13162,15471,7147,553,2301,7799,29889,10043,2258,21873,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,966,25974,1144,29892,966,439,948,1691,437,27649,13911,333,819,17239,9073,5278,904,20324,316,7604,4371,1671,6628,1314,23532,1487,288,29872,4090,276,316,8556,966,15935,29889,422,1004,966,534,574,743,1465,2379,271,1049,29892,1444,2453,1314,623,9555,1661,2331,1597,29892,3503,4239,26957,13391,818,301,29915,1947,647,882,316,301,29915,273,8678,347,29889,2581,2453,1314,19172,276,3479,2852,4749,1934,316,8689,6267,26138,330,4196,29892,9483,277,2637,29893,300,743,634,875,355,5606,20554,29892,4191,3700,443,286,3350,381,29889,11948,427,25698,5000,409,18593,3440,4332,9945,25947,30000,944,966,20758,4110,316,301,29915,1893,4749,424,29889,26383,553,3949,1064,294,29892,2123,29875,29892,3503,13545,3949,1064,294,29892,432,29915,4422,895,553,3949,1064,294,297,1341,279,3222,267,29892,634,432,29915,4422,895,10741,2245,16105,29889,12390,3949,1064,294,19172,296,316,8689,427,2600,13469,332,29889,1720,343,263,1597,1178,1318,634,316,21736,1089,29892,316,5478,950,7608,301,29915,19678,316,7015,3949,1064,294,29889,317,4987,712,18402,3949,6947,992,309,30001,818,301,29915,7342,1465,7814,12694,1237,29892,301,29915,1540,992,347,443,13137,316,409,7697,434,18679,18916,29892,301,29915,18288,409,7697,434,18916,29892,634,454,13137,707,443,17887,7006,1437,689,29948,29889,2581,26099,454,3623,479,553,3949,1064,294,29889,2581,16133,1908,966,6910,316,18402,1597,270,29915,14056,20554,29892,1444,544,1975,553,11486,29892,634,1444,1437,1982,1908,1190,425,1873,5534,29892,425,2298,325,336,347,269,13365,519,29889,350,999,29892,1444,1539,29879,316,301,29915,19809,1465,7015,21880,29889,341,1078,29
