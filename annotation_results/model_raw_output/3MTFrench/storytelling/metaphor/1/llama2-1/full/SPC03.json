For example, the use of \"il s'y arrête\" (he stops) and \"il multiplie ses risques de maladies\" (he multiplies his chances of illness) create a vivid image in the listener's mind and help convey the message more clearly. Additionally, the metaphor \"il est au chômage\" (he is unemployed) is used to describe the speaker's friend, which adds a personal touch to the explanation. Overall, the use of metaphors in the transcription enhances the explanation and makes it more engaging for the listener.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,274,29915,342,5646,26269,316,7890,29892,286,17914,360,2603,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,316,285,398,1318,29892,1444,24108,454,7980,29892,634,9411,966,7431,2310,2708,592,3669,29882,1249,296,316,286,29915,292,29539,316,285,398,1318,29889,8748,1444,24108,454,7980,818,301,29915,16063,457,10098,316,2298,29892,980,269,29915,29891,3948,9061,29892,634,274,29915,342,15237,2331,6628,1314,7980,29889,8748,1354,454,6773,818,409,364,568,29892,980,2473,572,347,3999,5161,1912,316,4439,328,583,1750,564,374,794,818,409,274,8584,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,980,263,13003,634,18679,4191,8556,9411,29871,1654,553,752,4211,267,316,7175,7316,29892,1671,3948,30037,357,316,285,398,1318,634,1671,289,692,261,2298,29889,5791,25698,5000,302,29915,342,2331,443,767,802,316,17385,362,2123,316,24792,29948,29892,782,6761,533,29889,323,681,7015,7191,3435,6836,7744,2406,818,7814,29892,270,29915,7308,4279,316,6316,452,6836,2022,5711,261,29889,997,1650,1671,8356,7848,1597,2280,316,16317,296,29948,29892,4067,1318,818,553,5446,1691,316,20877,29948,4511,2406,4191,553,16703,1973,270,29915,11236,2131,29892,1671,8556,263,1241,818,1874,261,1411,519,358,7814,4760,8192,316,6316,29889,2598,18848,316,266,17449,302,29915,342,2331,20498,882,316,9484,261,5278,2280,270,29915,562,2388,4211,882,15001,5711,1318,868,5161,802,5881,29875,586,6151,1070,29892,3503,316,7175,862,261,12563,301,29915,262,14867,12425,29892,301,29915,264,5815,30058,17239,1480,1387,29892,1750,19172,336,3479,19313,7664,11689,316,13942,29877,2496,5278,2280,29889,8748,1671,712,5278,2280,12852,6366,815,29892,980,21668,439,29915,1808,2653,5582,27516,553,5178,2719,15001,5711,743,818,18402,20077,316,5161,802,5881,29875,586,6151,1070,29889,8748,1671,19397,16219,381,7015,20077,29879,316,5161,802,29892,432,29915,4422,895,553,21880,1721,375,270,29915,1540,22085,9061,1757,1318,610,301,29915,22653,5000,29892,782,16573,316,29871,29906,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,18554,29889,16932,4625,1841,1112,700,818,553,1120,542,602,1056,2658,29892,1190,6267,4464,316,6316,29892,6267,2852,271,316,20877,29948,29892,6267,22591,5264,6351,23497,29889,8748,818,8019,316,14984,7015,21880,29892,1444,325,1759,19397,15882,553,12694,1237,20077,29879,316,5161,802,634,6787,533,553,564,16105,316,4224,2459,29889,8748,9551,261,818,301,29915,29874,680,270,29915,348,419,2131,270,29915,735,546,1372,10283,293,2993,29892,443,19607,7744,29948,818,18402,20077,29889,8748,1354,373,6664,993,818,24145,18926,29892,373,427,872,277,270,29915,485,749,270,29915,29282,1190,3911,29889,1720,5246,286,29915,6574,562,261,610,8694,29889,1720,263,553,17898,30019,787,29892,980,707,782,521,30069,29885,482,29889,360,29915,19908,1487,20077,29892,301,29915,6214,2947,3911,9551,261,553,1824,4467,15001,5711,743,1671,22964,2853,7015,2114,11620,316,5161,802,878,28677,29889,8748,1465,443,7017,8714,29892,980,2947,29892,610,17488,29892,9073,443,18766,270,29915,348,17478,7209,4434,562,29892,3503,8648,22964,2853,872,1136,3011,362,316,3038,267,29892,427,1841,700,275,424,7015,13900,21136,1379,29892,439,29915,442,276,782,269,9457,29889,8748,427,4951,29892,301,29915,29884,9551,261,553,7019,2925,270,29915,11236,2131,15001,5711,743,818,11387,316,3581,567,29889,8748,425,2186,2131,316,5278,2280,16933,439,29915,1808,12852,878,352,519,1465,454,8714,29889,8748,7847,29892,29378,2853,634,9551,261,553,1824,4467,634,553,5178,2719,427,18165,316,301,29915,29948,4068,868,20077,634,553,7175,8191,316,18402,20077,29889,8748,782,285,764,427,4951,29892,592,1190,1261,475,29892,432,29915
