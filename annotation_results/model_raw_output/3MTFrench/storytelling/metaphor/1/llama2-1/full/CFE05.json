The speaker uses metaphors throughout the speech to describe the importance of understanding the sources of pollution. For example, they compare the air pollution to a \"mille-feuille\" (a French dessert) to illustrate the complexity of the issue and how it affects different groups of people. They also use the metaphor of a \"river\" to describe the origins of pollution and how it flows through different environments. These metaphors help to explain the concept in an engaging and memorable way, which is why I choose option 2.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,24962,29892,439,29915,1808,263,454,3008,28230,454,2298,27131,1671,5646,7848,9364,424,712,301,29915,265,16067,9577,18484,1671,1274,7680,29889,341,4600,29871,29896,29892,270,555,381,29892,15237,2331,29892,18729,5246,316,4613,381,261,29892,3503,2331,302,29915,342,2331,316,1208,1908,316,425,2298,634,1661,1671,301,29915,26917,29889,16579,802,19951,29892,425,21180,918,553,301,30000,29894,690,5544,1849,316,425,767,371,316,29871,29955,14746,316,18554,818,301,29915,16063,650,29889,315,29915,342,2298,712,966,1437,346,2719,13299,352,296,316,29871,29896,29900,782,269,2911,29892,818,425,260,11234,1810,852,29892,782,432,370,1893,634,782,1035,16719,316,425,5782,29889,8748,14864,301,29915,22481,14475,316,425,20877,29948,29892,2298,316,29871,29929,18554,1190,29871,29896,29900,4613,381,296,316,301,29915,1466,427,6079,9201,15680,29889,3872,29883,29892,7890,29871,22730,270,29915,5753,536,2535,19601,712,6079,17043,277,966,8974,553,15680,627,267,1601,346,453,3783,707,9577,4100,29889,1704,18729,29892,8861,2852,271,29892,1750,19172,336,316,301,29915,370,283,261,553,26742,2445,583,316,1841,29467,29892,553,904,29885,6847,29892,553,269,30106,29886,15680,575,29892,274,29915,342,29871,4277,925,882,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,29889,8748,1671,6628,1314,454,7199,9030,29892,1444,26099,18916,7890,27516,301,29915,735,331,552,9577,2560,29889,6298,610,17488,29892,454,286,7342,358,316,1162,1132,29948,12563,425,26744,286,9061,1465,443,6701,13003,10505,19913,1465,5278,269,3498,29889,6803,2257,9073,29892,274,29915,342,2560,29889,1720,9378,277,316,7890,926,261,425,1139,29892,302,29915,342,29899,346,2331,29889,838,943,29892,599,787,29899,29891,29889,7747,1314,1750,3435,302,743,818,7814,4837,29879,29892,1444,7890,544,347,553,301,30000,29894,690,270,29915,314,29948,29889,4702,455,29892,19449,1750,3435,302,743,818,26231,29889,4702,455,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,592,27962,316,425,286,30037,280,29892,16134,424,24618,2663,29920,1098,296,19882,29889,7747,1314,1750,3435,302,743,818,7814,4837,29879,29892,373,425,6701,782,364,2231,424,29889,341,5093,1354,7890,302,29915,22730,2331,316,425,6701,11449,29892,18729,454,6701,7175,3476,2331,2535,611,15680,314,29889,2581,1437,8489,275,10713,269,473,1372,270,29915,326,6847,29892,12866,29892,301,29915,1466,269,29915,17234,29892,818,425,16623,424,610,1358,818,611,26722,29892,818,301,29915,29874,680,270,29915,449,2719,270,29915,348,599,275,805,4582,22781,29889,405,681,29892,1750,452,3435,2331,302,743,818,7814,4837,29879,29892,8556,302,29915,485,787,2331,5246,454,6701,1020,4026,1671,6003,381,29871,1654,29889,405,29915,29891,594,19959,966,286,30037,4467,288,513,690,1301,4011,29889,1174,8182,277,29892,8556,1029,787,553,269,30106,1295,28374,29889,315,29915,342,925,882,7015,338,6390,29879,712,1444,2453,1314,7199,9030,2535,611,15680,314,29892,443,904,455,264,553,269,30106,1295,409,2395,1750,2906,23510,7628,339,29915,2719,269,29915,29948,417,647,296,553,301,5908,8974,270,29915,2249,6847,2123,1677,1475,29889,28079,4191,23563,270,29915,296,2073,1750,4625,610,16589,29875,553,1644,13116,992,2658,553,3533,4285,270,29915,29948,695,290,14228,7446,1564,993,6003,381,818,7814,4837,29879,29892,966,15680,272,639,369,643,610,3581,10376,316,1644,13116,270,29915,29948,695,290,14228,634,1671,3911,270,29915,1300,424,694,533,29889,1720,8164,8648,12377,14623,553,367,29884,1960,15680,787,29892,9460,818,553,619,1912,3435,521,440,3783,1465,425,3006,332,347,29889,10793,367,15008,1314,15680,787,29892,818,7006,966,15680,787,1473,7147,29892,34
