For example, the comparison of the mutants to \"cells à l'intérieur de nos organes\" is an effective metaphor that helps the audience visualize the idea of mutations being present in everyone. The speaker also uses the metaphor of a \"radar\" to describe the function of the P53 protein, which helps to simplify the concept and make it more understandable. Overall, the use of metaphors in the speech is well-done and helps to convey the message more clearly.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,302,29915,1351,29920,18413,7618,29892,5469,29880,944,29889,11948,19601,29892,1444,7890,454,766,29892,966,5478,1934,3435,25763,8556,29889,341,5093,639,802,29871,4277,29892,11797,3435,427,8556,29889,341,29889,19551,29892,7890,7890,26427,29920,269,30095,276,358,29892,707,29899,346,439,29915,265,2947,13942,29877,2496,553,2428,19397,29879,4191,966,1060,29899,28154,1577,10050,29892,2331,5646,818,5246,29889,1174,5246,29892,966,5478,1934,3435,3669,600,29878,1860,316,5697,3246,3038,2540,818,301,29915,524,14508,316,7814,2894,267,29889,382,545,22527,29892,5646,316,289,24729,3038,2540,1750,409,3390,296,3119,30000,25873,443,21423,316,7019,2764,2131,427,29899,9346,329,362,29892,21624,349,29945,29941,29889,10793,410,6772,457,349,29945,29941,1667,29873,993,301,29915,524,27083,2131,316,24145,17571,29940,29889,323,29915,267,443,2971,279,29892,4875,1437,371,312,29872,301,29915,326,7018,29892,269,29915,4925,634,1437,695,927,454,19607,2858,2036,3038,352,14785,29889,315,29915,342,2560,29892,26138,6366,815,29889,6254,1004,8556,1671,1120,424,1437,1646,29878,9498,966,5478,1934,29892,4439,28661,22527,1661,29889,1704,28194,966,5478,800,4625,13003,1190,454,330,8146,316,349,29945,29941,29892,2257,21423,316,7019,2764,2131,707,297,4925,29889,1394,5786,2298,21181,452,8164,3710,30037,4630,966,3038,352,5478,1934,270,29915,465,283,2405,6267,2298,694,381,553,263,5475,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,29892,282,5495,966,18475,2863,18254,768,3145,29892,409,6674,4926,29892,8104,7608,634,8829,801,381,966,2894,267,1671,4642,553,508,22543,29889,8748,4875,452,269,29915,331,558,347,479,2331,29889,1704,4439,28661,22527,29892,443,1559,553,18554,29871,1654,5814,5326,2947,13942,29877,2496,443,23900,29889,8748,25763,4875,29892,1597,1190,29899,311,29899,272,1943,904,6149,362,316,349,29945,29941,29889,11948,712,5246,454,21423,5198,348,9407,1465,301,29915,13624,29892,302,29915,18441,2331,19343,29948,2453,5495,1190,8556,29889,1174,5246,29892,980,454,5246,29892,18402,14426,7209,439,29915,265,454,269,29915,264,7697,16731,29892,980,521,5793,29892,5702,634,1437,509,3121,966,3038,2540,23900,6394,29889,323,29915,267,1597,27128,519,16987,427,29899,9346,329,424,29889,11948,980,26030,6079,3008,28230,270,29915,348,17887,17103,316,282,681,344,29889,1704,966,3038,2540,5478,1934,29892,966,2298,286,2520,267,29892,16797,296,553,2428,19397,29879,316,6896,21558,29889,6340,1539,371,553,2656,267,316,330,2719,634,610,29890,4999,29892,553,3006,1041,316,3949,283,1579,482,634,316,6079,1399,342,1247,1821,634,27597,3479,26809,868,21423,5198,348,9407,29889,11948,3440,13942,29877,4798,29899,29873,29899,1808,7015,2428,19397,29879,1577,382,29882,6079,29892,301,29915,29882,1478,720,17449,316,611,266,17449,707,712,2257,3435,966,5478,800,868,21423,316,7019,2764,2131,349,29945,29941,29892,1750,3435,818,301,29915,17234,316,7015,2428,19397,29879,316,6896,21558,29889,306,455,29892,1444,610,1403,355,17016,818,1841,627,2147,349,29945,29941,634,3439,329,424,29889,2581,1671,23469,1462,29878,4193,6267,19397,634,966,13472,759,1224,454,17950,26786,29889,951,28839,782,2669,868,14913,3165,475,29889,2581,454,2245,1004,1841,1808,29889,365,29915,29948,29916,344,3038,267,29889,6803,544,8885,6267,10379,29892,432,29915,6388,895,29889,315,29915,342,15499,1465,553,5697,1169,3948,30037,4515,2637,3038,2540,23900,6394,634,3038,2540,5198,5441,7147,29889,8748,8997,454,13222,316,611,266,17449,29892,432,29915,1794,1601,509,29948,712,29892,2779,19882,29892,427,1841,11236,424,349,29945,29941,29
