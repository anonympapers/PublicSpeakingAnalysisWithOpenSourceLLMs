For example, they compare the state of matter to a \"pique-nique\" and use the term \"nobles\" to refer to metals with specific properties. These metaphors help to illustrate the concepts being discussed and make them easier to understand for the listener. Additionally, the speaker uses the metaphor of \"une femtos secondes\" to compare the duration of a change in structure to an hour, which provides a useful perspective on just how rapid these changes are. Overall, the use of metaphors in this transcript is effective in improving explanation and description.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,751,392,7890,2852,26477,17887,29892,7890,1029,26477,4224,23048,425,1775,5289,634,7015,1301,2187,316,8576,29889,11948,1661,29892,302,29915,388,6096,2331,1236,332,29892,7890,17043,5582,29920,9577,6079,29889,997,1775,5289,8164,409,5814,5893,5898,7732,2852,1446,29889,4956,1387,29892,15617,680,634,12642,29889,8748,1597,9558,316,8576,707,5646,1027,2037,443,1874,882,270,29915,28323,29889,1459,17488,29892,18097,7890,1539,371,29920,301,29915,14531,782,378,29887,3610,7289,1671,11469,553,330,1265,787,634,2143,336,30058,305,381,26814,2485,265,328,29880,7342,29892,634,6079,29892,7890,5246,267,1597,9558,316,8576,29892,7847,802,301,29915,14531,21714,316,301,29915,28323,15617,680,29889,6340,707,1223,324,680,29889,2581,26099,1597,266,17449,427,4824,1387,818,4107,29899,29923,29873,7081,1190,966,1301,2187,316,8576,1465,966,899,2247,29889,1174,5246,29892,1444,14954,1173,818,4327,261,443,11510,284,427,443,14857,29889,10050,29892,1444,452,325,1759,2331,4327,261,454,3814,427,470,4191,301,29915,265,1841,29894,15340,966,3657,326,9230,29892,6836,6267,953,572,3424,29889,11948,1444,325,1759,9073,6628,1314,29889,2581,14954,1173,818,9073,553,1874,4110,316,3829,8494,336,25595,1465,4883,29763,1750,1863,296,1465,454,6316,316,9411,966,16283,29889,478,1064,420,634,29763,1750,302,29915,735,9696,2331,1465,425,5469,29889,8748,2257,455,29892,427,13545,4445,29873,359,1473,267,29892,1597,4445,29873,359,1473,267,29892,274,29915,342,1597,22577,15958,316,26617,29892,443,7284,484,316,3533,29875,3163,270,29915,29882,19503,316,1473,267,29889,5202,276,358,6309,29892,1354,7890,16133,25138,301,29915,29282,316,301,29915,14540,1750,263,553,3533,29875,3163,634,553,3533,29875,3163,270,29915,812,2406,29892,634,6079,1597,4445,29873,359,1473,267,29892,610,13659,818,1597,26617,29892,274,29915,342,5695,8973,29892,439,29915,1540,540,545,29892,610,13659,818,301,29915,29282,316,301,29915,14540,29889,315,29915,342,1874,882,316,3829,5528,4727,519,358,25595,29892,3435,427,868,1950,22572,29915,15669,23068,818,553,1869,261,8494,336,29899,29883,2470,29889,2726,1652,1179,316,19703,5289,1750,452,1411,296,712,13545,270,466,13116,316,4445,29873,359,1473,267,29889,838,943,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,712,7890,269,496,26477,712,9411,966,8774,386,787,302,29915,609,2331,425,6701,3829,29889,478,681,8992,29920,966,8774,386,787,9709,793,2535,553,12301,267,1750,363,358,1597,3829,11071,634,13714,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,454,3209,553,8774,386,2631,270,29915,12352,17118,275,2406,610,425,5469,29892,4191,454,16735,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,9411,966,8774,386,787,302,29915,264,5152,27273,29892,1506,743,29948,29892,904,1484,749,29892,3829,29889,315,29915,342,4191,29871,4277,29889,838,943,707,29899,346,712,454,16735,1671,336,443,8694,316,6003,381,15996,1577,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,7175,3476,15471,2257,712,1444,14954,1173,818,9073,29892,1465,4883,23876,29889,435,29915,264,1365,29875,818,301,29915,29874,895,332,4445,29873,359,26617,1190,454,16735,634,1444,14954,1173,29889,997,289,7293,1411,1318,29892,425,289,7293,12838,2131,29892,425,289,7293,904,1089,12053,868,1869,261,1671,712,454,16735,427,443,14426,1735,316,3829,634,316,325,7081,29892,980,343,263,5695,15996,29889,8748,301,29915,524,1064,11992,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,263,2002,316,26957,10850,28141,1750,14924,509,609,13214,316,1841,700,533,301,29915,2249,2333,316,4810,29906,610,966,286,866,1295,29889,4231,6311,29892,966,382,442,354,29899,29924,29906,1473,267,29892,274,29915,342,443,17887,7006,4191,301,29915,24
