The speaker uses metaphors to explain and illustrate their points, making their message more engaging and memorable.\n\nIn the first question of the questionnaire, the speaker is asked to rate their usage of metaphors on a scale of 0 to 2, with 0 representing no use of metaphors and 2 representing extensive use of metaphors. Based on the transcript, I would rate the speaker's usage of metaphors as 1, as they use metaphors sparingly but effectively throughout their discourse.\n\nIn the transcript, the speaker uses several metaphors to describe the evolution of the bicycle and its cultural significance. For example, they compare the bicycle to a \"ludique et écolau\" object that allows for both playfulness and educational value. They also use a spatial metaphor by dividing the city into different territories based on the usage of the bicycle, with Paris being an exception.\n\nThe speaker's use of metaphors helps to clarify complex ideas and make them more relatable to their audience. For instance, when describing the change in the bicycle's cultural significance over time, the speaker uses a temporal metaphor by stating that the bicycle's usage has \"redefinisse sans cesse notre rapport à l'objet.\" This metaphor helps the listener understand how the bicycle's cultural significance has evolved over time.\n\nOverall, the speaker's use of metaphors in their discourse enhances their message and makes it more engaging for their audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,360,29915,585,7890,8992,29920,712,1444,26099,443,7006,1437,30019,434,29889,751,392,1444,592,26099,28580,768,818,2257,439,29915,265,2085,479,29892,432,29915,28899,275,5246,818,301,29915,333,1318,712,432,29915,9864,275,6003,381,1190,5278,20244,2535,1601,12389,417,29889,8748,4439,28661,22527,29892,980,707,19694,3711,19211,1465,454,27264,944,20480,348,2130,14119,452,16933,8478,11728,29889,3872,29883,1436,6311,29892,3911,29899,29873,29899,5474,610,966,316,1860,12389,417,29892,1444,592,16193,316,610,1358,316,26814,8744,868,12389,417,29889,1720,343,263,3058,882,25763,7890,553,18554,1750,22700,296,454,12389,417,13911,333,819,17239,29889,360,29915,14559,427,11172,439,29915,264,11172,439,29915,264,11172,980,5246,367,585,29892,634,10440,270,29915,14559,1750,452,269,29915,29891,26842,404,296,2331,868,5646,29889,1720,343,263,15237,11878,553,18554,1750,22700,296,454,12389,417,2298,712,270,29915,14559,29889,11948,2257,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,29892,274,29915,342,316,7199,9030,3440,966,904,4068,29879,316,7015,297,2445,284,7719,316,544,15819,29889,28266,301,29915,262,7316,868,12389,417,29892,966,17899,800,712,24145,19513,409,5246,316,2257,4464,4625,2600,898,15471,29378,27478,29889,8526,425,1436,868,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29892,454,12389,417,707,454,2730,11771,316,21578,553,289,473,479,11505,29889,897,301,29915,18288,316,12573,3479,8595,29871,29896,29929,29953,29900,29892,2257,4464,15210,454,12389,29882,293,1297,5016,833,280,316,301,29915,29948,1171,7334,362,553,4413,14938,7147,29889,8526,425,9460,316,7015,4239,5730,5908,298,1179,29892,454,12389,417,2637,1465,443,22448,19406,479,29892,301,29915,29282,904,21553,1387,29889,1632,20032,818,443,4325,874,29879,882,553,20368,1295,29892,454,12389,417,409,4327,29872,782,13413,818,425,10098,21615,1387,634,904,10936,585,19172,424,316,25497,276,3479,10899,265,1953,712,8556,926,296,24145,904,15635,29889,323,2663,16132,29892,1354,425,23324,14119,9257,19091,868,12389,417,337,25476,5582,7209,274,5340,24145,13659,818,301,29915,711,4026,29892,966,26842,29145,3435,316,8689,3440,409,425,409,3534,3121,1465,7814,544,19669,29889,8748,6079,712,454,904,4068,553,20368,1295,7697,316,13164,454,12389,417,13978,573,29892,966,1801,1691,868,18948,316,425,544,15819,1197,29889,8526,301,29915,17192,1808,316,301,29915,351,3820,290,10500,29892,373,1040,403,712,7015,15159,5908,8595,454,18948,316,425,544,15819,409,5246,270,29915,24430,1465,966,1644,690,4213,267,29889,1174,26842,404,424,29892,782,27282,553,8595,29871,29955,29900,29892,316,301,29915,26917,316,3444,29892,1444,1040,403,712,1465,966,8595,29871,29955,29900,29892,425,544,15819,707,10768,1318,270,29915,348,1298,316,15911,29740,29889,8407,1083,279,802,712,29892,818,3681,29892,425,544,15819,707,439,294,2073,297,28997,1647,29892,8532,439,29915,1808,409,1667,29873,993,427,9892,3197,434,29889,8748,782,9587,553,4224,2487,10270,1741,267,29892,782,1083,279,802,443,4325,874,29879,882,18652,6728,573,316,301,29915,21125,2637,966,5884,22297,29889,8748,782,2186,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29900,29892,782,1083,279,802,712,425,544,15819,409,9892,5711,1318,818,3681,29892,8532,712,1487,8744,269,29915,342,1841,700,277,427,13943,561,4894,29889,323,2663,16132,29892,5278,1841,22481,316,301,29915,21125,302,29915,342,2331,23422,18652,29892,3503,5695,5264,29892,454,24502,391,270,29915,29882,631,18342,424,427,9892,3197,434,29892,302,29915,342,2331,454,6701,712,454,24502,391,316,8694,868,18342,424,818,3681,29889,8748,427,2298,316,5278,16455,344,29892,1444,592
