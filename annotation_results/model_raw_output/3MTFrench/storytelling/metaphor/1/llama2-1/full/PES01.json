The speaker uses a few metaphors throughout the speech, such as \"un Europe\" (Option 1: Used, but improvements are possible) and \"le council de l'Europe\" (Option 1: Used, but improvements are possible). However, the speaker could have used more varied and creative metaphors to make their points more effectively.\n\nTherefore, I choose option 1.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,1738,853,20443,425,8825,1738,405,681,9364,787,443,4092,29892,373,8556,1029,787,29892,454,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,634,301,29915,562,14316,17611,264,316,734,8182,533,316,301,29915,21708,1750,17512,15532,7814,4441,1169,29892,7814,4303,1064,743,29892,6299,1166,2122,29889,1459,17488,29892,425,4303,19113,270,29915,4548,1414,29892,7814,4441,1169,29892,1766,423,6609,29892,3632,29438,950,267,29892,966,4441,1169,270,29915,279,374,412,20924,631,29889,951,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,634,301,29915,562,14316,17611,264,316,734,8182,533,316,301,29915,21708,29892,17737,434,782,9744,29892,626,15817,9386,425,24228,18934,316,409,337,417,381,818,805,2487,296,301,29915,21708,29889,7298,680,29885,358,29892,980,263,5246,301,29915,932,1481,29892,3503,301,29915,6574,627,302,29915,342,18413,1465,1597,25642,4771,29889,317,4227,449,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,1893,314,1117,279,802,634,301,29915,279,307,5295,29889,5462,409,2453,329,7890,1190,301,29915,279,307,5295,29973,315,29915,342,454,2298,4595,9744,868,9122,1750,263,17103,29948,2298,316,425,2730,26665,316,301,29915,1285,262,424,29889,315,29915,342,1597,7242,4584,2428,772,790,10646,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,8463,4584,2852,271,3817,2488,29889,315,29915,342,282,449,457,29892,1437,1129,277,29892,29871,29906,29900,6063,29889,478,681,282,6223,29920,7890,25497,276,818,425,1139,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,279,307,5295,707,443,4092,29889,2661,29899,346,712,409,454,9744,17611,264,29973,315,29915,342,4226,29892,1354,7890,25497,26477,1661,29889,365,29915,496,482,332,263,6701,302,29915,279,374,412,2331,818,409,1539,2484,270,29915,5753,536,1190,5278,1139,29889,365,29915,465,663,1616,4279,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,279,307,5295,707,443,14738,868,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,3503,274,29915,342,443,14738,9577,23662,29889,5202,276,301,29915,2696,5218,29892,712,301,29915,279,307,5295,707,443,17949,868,5419,316,13900,712,301,29915,5753,434,545,12852,29892,4875,6303,427,12573,2535,270,29915,14559,9744,18490,316,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29889,435,29915,1794,2123,29890,492,29948,782,9484,296,29889,8748,5695,29892,301,29915,273,5753,29948,4486,335,944,29892,1597,8691,316,18249,818,304,29875,29892,316,301,29915,562,5606,358,29889,8396,29892,432,29915,1794,2123,29890,492,29948,270,29915,14559,17124,6609,29889,8748,12866,29892,316,734,2970,301,29915,6574,627,270,29915,348,13547,634,11062,1190,454,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,301,29915,5753,434,545,17611,264,29892,26814,17950,316,301,29915,21708,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,712,301,29915,932,8109,749,316,301,29915,279,307,5295,29892,782,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,263,1034,29892,8556,6309,29892,1190,5278,18765,362,29892,707,5278,12666,29889,6803,2062,9030,29892,1444,14954,1173,818,1601,509,261,712,14984,966,5302,724,29878,30000,794,868,1283,1249,712,301,29915,2696,276,21423,868,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,263,1034,634,443,610,29888,1249,29889,8748,712,301,29915,279,307,5295,263,443,2134,29888,1249,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,766,1601,373,371,332,712,316,734,2970,301,29915,2467,427,4327,29948,29892,4875,263,454,27923,316,301,29915,15654,634,301,29915,5753,536,29889,365,29915,18288,712,274,29915,342,18916,29892,425,4224,2459,316,301,29915,279,307,5295,263,4370,1597,29835,316,1841,4068,1671,301,29915,29877,3200,29948,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,263,1034,818,443,6788,316,17950,818,301,29915,21708,29889,11948,29892,707,29899,346,712,5278,1841,4068,263,330,355,5606,2298,316,6079,712,316,44
