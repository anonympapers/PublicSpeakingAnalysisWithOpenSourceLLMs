For example, they compare the medication to a \"tuyau imperm√©able\" and \"nanogoutes\" to describe its ability to penetrate the tumor without affecting the healthy tissue. These metaphors are used effectively to explain the concept of the treatment and how it works, making it easier for the audience to understand. Therefore, I choose option 2, indicating that the metaphors are used efficiently to improve explanation.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,712,454,10283,293,1166,11658,29948,1465,24145,14913,2947,409,1841,1595,381,760,449,634,712,454,925,29872,1597,22577,4323,2131,316,409,10283,293,1166,2947,21609,19844,301,29915,6388,2131,29889,8748,373,263,454,6701,1671,301,29915,1893,277,434,23900,261,1559,454,10283,293,1166,9418,29899,29883,661,2265,261,302,29915,279,4401,2331,818,12694,264,13241,427,534,277,790,375,424,634,868,23900,261,29889,360,29915,29877,30071,409,10283,293,1166,22847,1597,2752,553,285,6394,1473,7147,3479,2894,267,634,3479,22069,29892,2257,439,29915,309,12242,1249,316,872,18165,266,1572,412,329,1387,29892,373,3964,14150,427,301,29915,328,852,29892,427,13159,598,966,508,22543,29892,443,18765,424,316,301,29915,29948,1545,29948,3364,291,1750,27442,568,875,2267,882,2298,6366,815,634,11387,316,301,29915,29872,2192,29889,7747,439,29915,309,8556,282,681,344,946,381,11555,427,1298,285,1794,569,1465,301,29915,1893,277,434,23900,261,29892,373,263,24889,29948,712,425,3829,553,325,4582,2925,427,3209,4625,470,427,301,29915,1893,277,434,23900,261,23900,261,707,12694,2016,316,14344,270,29915,1893,277,434,4107,29889,6803,443,2653,19505,29892,7015,325,4582,2925,363,358,443,5291,29891,585,10112,12031,29875,519,29889,17812,6309,712,1671,553,6808,375,23900,261,29892,2257,5291,29891,585,22847,553,25226,2123,1765,1973,29889,3872,29883,29892,432,29915,1794,4224,24969,316,8121,261,1190,3999,3291,2258,13876,29889,10393,294,29892,316,534,8885,1597,1650,1671,1020,1524,301,29915,1893,277,434,23900,261,7209,6602,261,301,29915,1893,277,434,4107,634,427,18765,424,301,29915,328,852,29892,337,24359,610,301,29915,1893,398,487,29892,427,8164,1020,1524,301,29915,1893,277,434,23900,261,610,269,29915,309,1999,482,29889,853,1354,569,482,29892,782,432,329,3610,895,553,23432,468,449,267,29892,3503,2331,302,29915,326,13732,439,29915,1808,302,29915,29874,302,29915,29874,11313,449,267,29892,634,4883,23432,468,449,267,325,609,7848,316,425,260,8284,270,29915,21813,868,1644,9874,316,23432,290,14228,29892,1750,6267,19172,296,316,27962,610,966,2123,1765,1973,20854,434,2993,29892,553,325,4582,2925,427,6815,29892,553,21622,2470,29889,11948,16784,347,6394,23432,468,449,267,3435,883,743,553,748,30095,1372,316,270,29915,6905,488,29892,1465,301,29915,14531,29892,427,8872,2673,29892,634,274,29915,342,1465,454,22888,488,6722,1444,2453,1314,373,316,3209,344,23589,454,10283,293,1166,9418,29899,3068,2265,276,1314,29892,634,1671,966,16160,7608,29892,1444,6267,13612,2663,553,904,29885,6847,634,980,21668,626,759,425,1480,866,7209,2078,568,29892,1444,966,11658,29872,1465,454,1487,29892,3503,980,592,21668,443,2730,11771,1671,19612,12416,4883,23432,468,449,267,634,4303,29539,454,10283,293,1166,925,29872,782,5291,398,487,29892,540,545,22527,29892,634,6079,966,10890,1223,1934,29889,2664,10890,1223,1934,3435,427,5246,1597,1647,29892,1750,263,1597,868,1178,1318,29892,24221,634,553,1437,2590,29892,17424,28065,787,425,4303,10500,868,10283,293,1166,9418,29899,3068,2265,276,1314,29892,301,29915,485,8501,270,29915,4422,7608,553,23432,468,449,267,29892,1750,724,609,5039,743,610,966,9238,509,465,787,29892,6896,1693,1465,454,5246,712,1444,1236,1314,18765,261,29889,2581,325,1759,4313,30069,1358,454,260,2993,316,10283,293,1166,4303,29539,29892,6722,1444,24108,425,437,344,337,24359,610,966,21622,2470,29892,7209,2779,261,966,260,790,375,29871,4277,29892,5646,427,6260,275,424,966,1801,1691,1473,7147,29892,634,1444,16623,5646,29871,4277,868,2258,15529,29892,274,747,12898,29892,1661,454,19723,631,29892
