For example, they compare the site visit to a \"grand potentiel d'influences\" and describe the elements persuasive as \"un nain Ã©trikeur\" that can follow the participants' gaze during the site visit. These metaphors help to make the explanation more vivid and memorable, and thus more effective in conveying the message. Therefore, I would rate the use of metaphors in this speech as high (2) on a scale of 0 to 2.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,18080,29892,4473,8894,966,11099,743,29892,1444,592,16391,19398,7890,22572,29915,15669,1671,11482,9030,425,4556,316,611,3132,29872,29892,425,20408,7002,29889,6340,707,26142,1318,270,29915,13453,3837,2265,966,20299,4110,427,1354,29899,9894,1934,29892,1465,553,274,2049,29891,575,634,553,8324,29889,478,681,1437,5464,29883,1318,872,29845,1465,1597,1773,4279,316,11549,277,10270,7825,1512,1314,29889,2581,7199,1975,325,359,274,5270,267,29889,10050,992,347,270,29915,348,2643,29892,443,7284,270,29915,328,3640,29884,427,297,6578,1893,29889,11948,425,20408,7002,288,29872,4090,276,5695,1671,425,289,7293,4556,29889,435,29915,932,1808,818,425,2594,276,7629,1318,11387,5882,29892,1750,7890,1283,374,336,818,966,758,29884,1960,18806,13876,868,1437,29894,283,882,29892,316,611,3132,29872,782,2669,316,301,29915,21813,17239,29889,26475,19882,29892,274,29915,342,454,29140,782,13295,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,29889,461,443,274,2049,11771,8164,13417,533,553,4348,375,818,1874,261,6267,20299,882,634,2298,7175,3476,15471,553,20299,4110,7853,1849,818,301,29915,21813,17239,1577,6803,25497,276,818,5278,1139,29892,286,29915,1131,342,29899,346,270,29915,4582,1132,267,427,7732,2852,11603,29889,28720,904,941,412,29892,432,29915,1794,7019,1464,5483,7732,11840,29892,399,29686,29892,7646,412,815,29892,12968,2131,29892,289,2660,1536,2131,29889,365,29915,3318,361,707,316,17161,261,454,3268,782,2298,26379,3104,296,709,270,29915,13453,29884,2063,29889,6803,409,9073,29892,29871,29945,29892,29945,289,8226,286,29915,609,1757,29948,553,1663,412,1953,818,301,29915,29874,680,316,867,275,316,3994,5908,639,6102,10770,10270,6787,3246,610,553,2902,1372,29889,9353,5278,364,573,29892,7890,5663,8885,6096,610,17488,454,3994,1908,270,29915,1131,381,427,269,2249,8194,9139,29892,1750,409,11482,2344,610,454,5246,316,1437,695,264,4630,1597,904,29885,8194,521,747,283,1671,7890,5528,1524,818,946,381,29889,1174,21751,424,966,6896,19718,399,29686,29892,274,29915,342,818,1147,2872,7848,454,3268,782,2298,26379,3104,296,709,270,29915,13453,29884,2063,29892,2257,1750,8556,13417,277,818,425,26617,904,941,412,29889,6101,399,29686,640,993,553,7877,29948,1860,20408,294,10270,29892,21668,29899,309,10440,343,544,30037,357,8570,1577,6803,18729,29892,29871,29941,29900,27138,4625,3902,272,29948,399,29686,29889,349,5818,2257,8714,29892,925,29872,2181,434,316,6267,4880,29892,818,301,29915,29874,680,270,29915,348,302,475,2852,14090,332,29892,443,21423,11039,29948,1465,6267,4538,7289,1750,592,14924,316,10252,276,6267,4880,13180,6267,3902,12418,29889,897,5278,2258,15529,29892,1444,872,275,7175,3476,15471,2257,1750,263,4370,5820,29948,29892,2123,1661,29892,2257,1750,8556,13417,277,818,425,26617,904,941,412,29892,553,7877,29948,1860,20408,294,10270,1098,381,296,24145,8570,29892,3503,707,29899,346,439,29915,2719,4625,966,2258,1169,831,1285,29948,1577,6803,454,4048,6390,29892,1444,29188,966,1098,20816,8288,712,966,7609,1080,20299,882,2122,29892,4191,454,5246,316,9073,443,1016,818,399,29686,29889,7747,1139,15421,263,10259,492,4370,1597,8861,10098,29892,10042,425,1998,568,868,3268,634,1597,26617,10098,7907,29892,29871,4277,592,14924,316,1040,1008,1354,980,343,263,11878,2779,19882,553,1874,4110,270,29915,1131,2509,29892,2123,270,29915,1131,4279,29892,3503,2298,7175,3476,15471,316,8689,454,619,264,29892,553,7877,29948,1860,5820,2406,1750,4625,2653,13417,533,7015,1874,4110,29889,478,681,301,29915,1351,29920,7199,275,29892,18080,11946,8894,966,435,545,1372,29892,425,20408,7002,8164,24304,1358,
