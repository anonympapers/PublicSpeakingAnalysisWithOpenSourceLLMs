The task is to evaluate the usage of metaphors in the discourse of the speaker. The options are:\n\n0 = No usage of metaphors\n1 = The metaphor is used, but improvements are possible\n2 = The metaphor effectively describes the characteristics and improves explanation\n\nThe transcript is as follows:\n\n\"I have some bad news. Your house is infested with mice. They're everywhere. So, what should we do? Let's go to the mice, just like the ones in Medjugorje, by age of being all over your house. But remember, the end of the episode, the mouse is still there. Shouldn't we think about going to buy a mouse trap? But can this simple reasoning be applied to the fight against cancer? When chemotherapy, which casts its entirety on its passage and cytotoxic therapy doesn't work, couldn't we use a mouse trap? My thesis is to transform this idea into reality. My mouse is the glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer that neither surgery, nor radiotherapy, nor chemotherapy can eliminate completely. The first step has been taken to create a trap that looks like the brain. I used the main component of cerebral spinal fluid, which is found everywhere in the brain. The problem is that it degrades quickly. We need it to stay long enough in the brain for the cancer cells to migrate into the trap. I mixed it with ring-shaped fibers produced by the company Sois, and created a micro-sponge, which is a material that can be inflated and has ports allowing for the circulation of cancer cells. The second step is to identify a napa, or a tumor, among the abnormal growths. Studies have shown that glioblastoma cells responsible for the relapse of the cancer after treatment are attracted by a protein called SDF1. I have loaded my sponge with this small molecule to Glioblastome. The idea is to have a set of instructions, and the surgeon will quickly and carefully remove the maximum amount of tumor. Our trap has pulled at the hour, the cancer cell that was attracted by the protein SDF1. There remains much to be done to make this trap functional, and we do not yet know what will be most efficient for eliminating the captured cells. But maybe one day, thanks to him, we will finally be able to say, 'I have a very good news. You no longer have mice in your house.'\"\n\nBased on the transcript, I would choose option 2: The metaphor effectively describes the characteristics and improves explanation. The speaker uses metaphors throughout the transcript to describe the cancer cells and the trap used to capture them. For example, the speaker compares the cancer cells to mice, and the trap to a mouse trap. This metaphorical language helps to explain complex medical concepts in a more understandable way for the listener. The speaker also uses vivid imagery to describe the process of creating the trap, such as \"micro-sponge\" and \"ports allowing for the circulation of cancer cells.\" Overall, the usage of metaphors in the transcript effectively enhances the explanation of the speaker's
