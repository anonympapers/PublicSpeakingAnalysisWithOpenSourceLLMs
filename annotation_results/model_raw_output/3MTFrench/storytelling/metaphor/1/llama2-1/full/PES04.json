For example, they compare the economic situation in Australia and France to a \"fabrication de sous-marins\" (submarine production) without any explicit explanation, which requires the listener to make an association between the two countries' economic performance. Similarly, they use the metaphor of \"l'eau des places\" (the water of the squares) to describe the importance of the economy in society, which is a creative and memorable way to convey this idea. Overall, the speaker's use of metaphors enhances their explanation and makes it more engaging for the listener.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,966,12278,1179,14858,5059,275,29892,2971,279,634,260,30057,1912,1750,3435,1661,4991,743,4625,316,4662,280,1295,29889,2664,14979,23435,1750,269,29915,342,9577,19398,3911,634,439,29915,2719,1424,294,277,966,20542,7907,966,10890,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,966,23837,583,5374,1338,29892,966,904,4068,29879,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,29892,274,29915,342,9577,4100,29889,2664,4292,9230,634,425,15253,347,5374,1338,325,609,301,29915,5474,9577,25595,358,29889,2664,1766,23469,735,1277,10120,425,11896,1190,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,1465,454,4092,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,301,29915,11569,1690,272,882,316,796,536,1481,980,302,29915,342,2331,10814,1671,966,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,29889,2664,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,302,29915,342,2331,21394,270,29915,287,3409,29948,1671,1437,699,276,443,12471,17239,12128,7853,519,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,980,302,29915,342,2331,1950,1671,534,8885,425,11896,29889,21678,29920,29899,14167,29872,1277,10120,425,11896,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,427,2852,566,631,301,29915,10126,309,392,553,10273,29948,558,1169,634,534,8885,966,10273,293,532,2658,29889,1174,16132,29892,5278,10273,293,532,2658,1863,296,29889,2581,534,8885,1794,425,11896,2637,966,23837,583,5374,1338,634,966,904,4068,29879,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,1671,339,7768,454,23837,347,5264,29973,1720,343,263,818,19601,6303,1804,29948,427,15017,2637,301,29915,22537,347,634,966,3444,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,316,425,18187,362,316,9411,5898,29899,29885,2749,424,1750,1283,276,2665,267,7209,7930,417,347,1190,553,8595,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,4029,11710,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,1750,409,21714,29973,1720,286,29915,294,2386,993,443,23837,347,1750,27435,2947,1671,1487,553,7930,371,29899,558,1169,5374,1338,1750,707,425,27219,533,270,29915,348,29871,29946,29900,29995,427,1841,700,428,316,402,2736,29889,9353,454,27666,10996,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,443,23837,347,9577,4100,707,25732,277,361,29889,838,943,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,14531,553,7600,1750,269,29915,309,343,263,301,29915,29948,4599,347,25881,707,9577,4100,634,4625,28643,443,7048,27774,532,2658,29889,315,29915,342,818,8556,316,10420,261,818,301,29915,3496,381,634,427,27516,443,18551,1841,535,5553,631,316,1437,3511,454,23837,1387,29889,8748,274,29915,342,2331,856,315,29915,14386,1083,262,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,2831,445,3414,29892,306,674,27599,278,1301,3395,4944,322,1234,278,5155,297,278,1797,896,2615,297,278,1139,15421,29889,13,13,16492,29871,29896,29900,29901,1551,263,6287,310,29871,29900,304,29871,29906,29892,920,437,366,14707,278,671,310,1539,12451,943,297,278,12032,29973,13,13,8375,3060,2662,29901,29871,29906,13,13,1576,25657,3913,1539,12451,943,17583,10106,278,1301,3395,304,8453,4280,17407,22001,322,11157,8252,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,7252,278,17407,6434,297,8314,322,3444,304,263,376,16582,2200,362,316,5898,29899,3034,1144,29908,313,1491,24556,5802,29897,1728,738,6261,8252,29892,607,6858,278,13254,304,1207,385,15477,1546,278,1023,10916,29915,17407,4180,29889,20175,29892,896,671,278,1539,481,2015,310,376,29880,29915,14531,553,7600,29908,313,1552,4094,310,278,25256,29897,304,8453,278,13500,310,278,26504,297,12459,29892,607,338,263,907,1230,322,26959,519,982,304,27769,445,2969,29889,6811,497,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,1539,12451,943,26371,2925,1009,8252,322,3732,372,901,3033,6751,363,278,13254,29889],"total_duration":117383774836,"load_duration":1071052867,"pr
