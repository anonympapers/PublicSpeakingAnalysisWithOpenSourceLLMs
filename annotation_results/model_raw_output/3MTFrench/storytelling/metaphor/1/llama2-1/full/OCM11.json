I will choose one option from the OPTIONS provided for each question and give my answer in the format \"Option chosen: 0, 1 or 2\".\n\nQuestion 10: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you rate the use of metaphors in the discourse of this transcription?\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n0 = No metaphors used.\n1 = Metaphors are used, but improvements are possible.\n2 = Metaphors effectively describe characteristics and enhance explanation.\n\nBased on the transcript provided, I choose option 2: The metaphors used in the discourse effectively describe the characteristics and enhance the explanation. The speaker uses metaphors to convey the idea that the men who were deported during the Holocaust are not really dead, but exist in our texts, testimony, and words. The use of metaphors adds depth and emotion to the speaker's argument, making it more impactful and memorable.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,592,3669,1403,575,270,29915,1540,16549,553,6749,29887,1475,818,399,16302,29889,435,29915,1794,25456,21394,316,18554,1465,611,6316,29889,997,715,786,442,270,29915,296,336,30058,793,3435,5758,267,29889,2664,10890,29892,1444,966,7468,639,700,610,346,712,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,11878,425,4889,316,1020,369,643,425,16014,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,1020,369,643,5278,16053,479,29889,435,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,7199,9030,1671,339,7768,29871,29896,29945,29871,29900,29900,29900,3632,29438,29884,4999,23997,4370,1437,637,743,1465,966,339,4999,24145,26702,29889,382,29883,2663,29920,29892,26269,316,8556,29892,7890,301,29915,296,3324,29920,29892,26269,316,8556,980,343,263,454,15142,29889,12390,17137,11113,375,1465,966,592,453,787,316,301,29915,13624,29889,16932,4625,4370,1437,637,743,1465,553,3949,567,316,26702,29889,997,2967,29892,454,18848,707,818,364,465,6967,1465,966,19638,5908,29889,2664,3581,567,316,611,5702,553,5886,29899,29886,417,567,1190,966,21206,1475,2085,29890,2406,29889,2664,2117,1862,1190,794,966,3516,3775,29892,3503,11797,452,766,10978,21181,29889,6803,339,7768,1577,1459,346,439,29915,2719,2453,352,296,23422,10503,440,276,443,14857,8694,29889,15113,29892,432,29915,1794,301,29915,11728,7015,21880,316,301,29915,13624,634,2298,432,29915,1794,425,7814,1318,29889,2581,302,29915,279,4401,2331,427,260,9030,966,2181,275,29892,966,13159,492,1912,316,7015,1437,637,743,29889,2581,302,29915,1794,875,355,29884,10440,712,454,15142,29889,838,943,29892,1444,592,26099,10733,29948,1224,425,27940,29889,8748,274,29915,342,5695,454,29140,316,611,266,17449,29889,435,29915,1794,27883,553,1644,13116,634,553,1644,13116,270,29915,5128,6617,1190,425,1437,637,362,3632,29438,13498,29889,1720,286,29915,29891,1083,545,1249,818,1601,28074,1924,29892,274,29915,342,1437,637,29948,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,452,28078,11818,2331,712,611,19886,1318,29892,2257,712,611,19886,1318,29892,2257,712,1444,302,29915,1794,29892,2257,19886,3709,1190,301,29915,29882,25892,316,301,29915,2190,29889,435,29915,1794,1104,29884,29892,634,432,29915,1794,1104,29884,7015,6515,29889,435,29915,1794,3643,1354,10440,29892,10440,29892,270,29915,18288,1813,29889,4241,841,424,29892,11797,3435,18916,29889,435,29915,1794,2654,293,17856,966,301,30000,29894,690,29892,432,29915,1794,2654,293,17856,966,26809,316,7015,1437,637,743,29889,16932,3435,21617,375,8774,29888,690,1465,1597,904,6468,316,15935,29892,316,752,465,291,29892,712,425,27940,592,14924,4904,29889,435,29915,1794,966,3686,2747,1249,1465,966,13137,29889,1720,286,29915,609,610,12898,29889,435,29915,9983,1908,19397,7890,9073,760,1875,22572,29915,15669,29892,611,15935,1671,2257,18848,29889,315,29915,342,443,18848,29889,2581,652,23469,270,29915,1279,29948,5458,15694,6947,533,29889,1720,1136,2488,29892,7890,454,992,4099,29920,29892,2257,15142,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,454,1506,7608,29889,435,29915,1794,8829,347,316,1083,13974,2265,454,15142,610,553,286,1862,29889,8748,9411,966,286,1862,1750,592,286,29915,29874,2073,427,592,24811,818,301,29915,487,1924,29892,9411,966,286,1862,712,1444,301,275,1465,7015,6017,550,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,966,17161,261,270,29915,24430,427,19601,634,18158,316,7890,966,9073,760,1875,29889,12390,17137,29899,27048,29892,11797,452,3435,2331,325,336,2073,5758,29889,16932,1863,296,29889,16932,3435,1465,24145,19696,371,29889,16932,3435,1465,966,13349,29877,647,1179,29889,16932,3435,1465,9411,966,286,1862,1750,966,4625,30
