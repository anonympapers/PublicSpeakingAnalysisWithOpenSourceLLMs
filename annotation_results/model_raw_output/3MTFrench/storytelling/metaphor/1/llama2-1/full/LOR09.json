For example, they refer to the plants as \"extraordinary\" and \"superplants,\" and describe their absorption mechanisms as \"filantu\" and \"ambiqué.\" These metaphors help to create a vivid image in the listener's mind and make the explanation more engaging and memorable. Additionally, the speaker uses metaphors to compare the plants to other elements, such as water and nickel, which helps to illustrate their importance and relevance. Overall, the use of metaphors in the speaker's discourse is effective in improving explanation and creating a clearer image in the listener’s mind.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,578,381,29892,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,7890,2437,1524,1465,443,17775,29889,2581,364,14056,5646,925,29872,270,29915,294,29899,29891,868,5053,29899,342,29892,316,301,29915,26917,26811,275,562,316,12340,484,585,29889,2581,302,29915,28899,275,2331,427,11757,2925,29889,435,29915,28899,275,427,1518,24773,1465,425,363,11992,9201,28148,1190,7015,260,29899,309,9364,296,553,715,3794,4805,536,1099,2658,29892,1750,409,302,473,29878,19047,553,8774,386,2631,868,899,29889,997,2362,9364,296,5695,553,16895,4285,29892,1750,302,29915,609,2331,4595,12784,818,4185,2147,634,712,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,263,1241,29889,435,29915,1794,28643,966,8774,3068,1608,267,270,29915,6897,272,683,316,7015,715,3794,1671,19172,276,3479,9221,12906,371,1295,316,966,3814,357,1190,553,25999,9577,8261,267,427,11510,2993,29889,315,3100,707,20737,12036,424,427,4092,29892,427,21805,347,29892,1190,553,25999,8164,9073,29899,29873,29899,309,2123,1437,11818,643,1577,8748,425,289,473,20141,316,3444,634,270,29915,22537,347,12931,1296,29882,29892,409,3435,4067,743,2535,966,610,1912,5233,2993,316,3792,1759,347,1671,9484,261,425,8861,610,29879,1808,9201,28148,553,260,29899,309,316,7015,2428,572,3794,29889,8748,992,309,30001,3440,1444,592,26099,5663,5128,29948,2778,316,11449,25226,818,301,29915,29282,316,29871,29906,29946,29889,28266,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,29871,29896,29947,29900,29900,29892,432,29915,1794,286,29915,542,4979,412,316,29871,29953,29947,29900,289,10126,29948,715,3794,1750,409,302,473,29878,19047,316,11510,2993,29889,365,29915,2015,484,585,707,977,424,29884,29892,409,2143,375,29892,425,302,473,29878,9948,818,301,29915,1117,8105,29948,29889,838,943,373,2947,966,623,7367,2331,5646,316,432,1662,29889,10043,5646,316,432,1662,640,993,2225,802,29871,29941,29995,316,25985,295,29889,10016,10098,1506,30095,12898,29892,274,29915,342,29871,29896,29900,29900,29995,4555,373,640,7081,29871,29941,29900,15543,315,29915,342,6079,2298,712,966,1375,1064,30000,16105,17541,4582,433,455,339,882,1750,452,640,23510,712,29871,29896,29892,29906,29995,25985,295,29889,1174,7438,29871,29906,29900,29896,29947,29892,2535,1597,25740,316,14954,1173,1295,7691,29892,8556,626,11689,427,2058,553,20075,4110,19172,424,316,10252,276,454,25985,295,1465,966,3438,9351,29899,303,19503,1465,966,610,3729,267,712,7890,992,4099,29920,589,9318,19601,29889,12390,714,2719,8556,19172,296,316,4048,6390,454,20299,882,868,25985,295,29889,1459,17488,29892,8556,19172,296,316,1841,1054,357,301,29915,14531,1750,3581,280,454,1472,553,20491,7545,1750,29370,454,899,2123,1750,3581,280,454,1472,553,534,681,29889,2581,592,7697,8648,9411,966,12134,17478,427,611,30085,29879,347,1671,8689,4883,289,10126,29948,715,3794,29889,2581,1841,1054,371,13214,868,899,712,432,29915,7054,895,818,425,10098,1190,454,28439,634,427,10212,20141,29892,18934,316,4880,261,13214,6267,3006,332,427,25985,295,29889,1632,20032,818,7015,6896,19718,29892,1465,4832,17478,29892,1444,3669,29882,1249,818,7594,1298,425,9257,316,7015,715,3794,634,7847,966,9946,29899,303,19503,427,25985,295,29889,9353,443,7006,2298,270,29915,348,385,29892,20737,29892,1444,2181,347,443,878,15340,29892,1601,509,261,818,7594,1298,425,9257,316,7015,715,3794,707,6366,815,634,23990,519,1671,427,9073,443,21423,316,13162,15471,818,301,29915,4548,417,7018,7903,332,29889,2726,14954,1173,1295,316,24190,8182,993,13547,944,2257,15744,1750,4625,9484,29948,1597,20234,2852,1387,316,1841,5231,10500,553,11510,2993,29889,315,29915,342,454,269,440,271,28643,
