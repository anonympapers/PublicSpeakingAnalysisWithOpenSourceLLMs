For example, when discussing the potential benefits of a mascot for Hong Kong, the speaker compares it to a \"mask\" that can help people \"see beyond\" their immediate surroundings. Similarly, when explaining the importance of adaptability in the face of uncertainty, the speaker uses the metaphor of a \"film\" that needs to be \"rewound\" to understand the past and make better decisions in the present.\n\nThroughout the speech, the metaphors are used to add depth and complexity to the ideas being presented, making them more engaging and easier to understand for the audience. Therefore, I would rate the use of metaphors in this speech as high, with an option choise of 2.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6101,7890,7890,270,3246,611,30058,5888,29892,7890,282,1947,29920,8164,29899,5474,782,18643,955,316,8556,443,4280,29872,2298,316,7548,331,567,454,1998,482,2123,10440,818,270,30058,4515,1559,5606,1465,454,2706,316,611,30058,5888,634,8164,29899,5474,316,409,8164,1437,264,381,712,2257,16933,410,1173,454,2298,712,611,23520,427,11643,5458,634,712,454,2298,712,454,2298,29889,1174,2257,712,5291,408,4370,8556,2906,787,427,9410,663,316,7890,13304,3479,6761,2658,316,425,11643,5458,7081,29889,6803,25497,276,3479,1437,3476,1080,316,2257,712,7890,544,10281,316,425,2930,10491,316,22259,2131,29892,8556,425,454,2706,610,772,647,882,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,310,425,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,997,2930,10491,316,425,2930,10491,316,301,1312,2
