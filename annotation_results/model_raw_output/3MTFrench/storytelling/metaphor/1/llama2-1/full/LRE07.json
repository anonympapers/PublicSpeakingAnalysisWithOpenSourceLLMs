The speaker uses metaphors to explain complex ideas and to make their language more vivid and engaging.\n\nThe speaker uses the metaphor of a \"little sun\" to describe their own creativity and productivity, saying that they are \"a little sun\" who dreams of becoming a poet and has a \"tooth\" that is afraid of the dark. This metaphor helps the listener understand the speaker's personality and creative potential.\n\nThe speaker also uses the metaphor of a \"hilbert\" to describe the uncertainty and unreliability of some methods of prediction. The speaker compares these methods to a \"bruni\" who is blinded by the sun and can no longer provide accurate predictions. This metaphor helps the listener understand the limitations of certain predictive methods and the importance of considering multiple perspectives.\n\nThe speaker uses the metaphor of a \"little island\" to describe the potential impact of their research on the world. The speaker says that they are working on level 2 of the prediction, which involves providing a probabilistic outcome rather than a definitive answer. This metaphor helps the listener understand the complexity and uncertainty of predicting future events.\n\nOverall, the speaker uses metaphors to add depth and creativity to their discourse, and to help the listener understand complex ideas and emotions. The use of metaphors in this transcript enhances the speaker's message and makes it more engaging and
