Pas d'utilisation de métaphores - The speaker does not use any metaphors throughout the transcript.\n1. La métaphore est utilisée, mais des améliorations sont possibles - The speaker uses a few metaphors, but they could be more effective in conveying their message.\n2. La métaphore décrit efficacement les caractéristiques et améliore l'explication - The speaker effectively uses metaphors to explain their ideas and provide depth to their argumentation.\n\nANSWER: Option 2. The speaker uses metaphors effectively to describe the characteristics of the democratic system and to improve their explanation. For example, when discussing the role of the judge in the EU, the speaker compares it to a \"great room\" where different states come together to make decisions. This metaphor helps to illustrate the complexity of the decision-making process and the importance of cooperation among the states. Similarly, when discussing the alternatives to the EU's financial system, the speaker uses a metaphor of \"cutting off the robbery\" to convey the idea that the EU should take action to protect its values and prevent member states from neglecting them. Overall, the speaker's use of metaphors adds depth and clarity to their argumentation and helps to make their point more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,30219,29874,5246,7890,325,336,2073,2257,712,274,29915,342,712,425,16158,16909,347,1671,301,29915,28323,316,17950,29889,2581,29758,439,29915,2719,20715,29880,21017,29889,12390,1437,29876,2209,1080,752,1461,3783,9411,966,16283,3503,1671,4048,6390,2257,712,274,29915,342,1841,295,944,29892,29871,4277,15210,21394,2298,1437,506,271,29889,9353,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,373,263,443,4274,1750,6309,712,301,29915,19986,707,6299,1318,1190,553,20368,1295,4555,24145,16158,16909,347,707,24145,2852,271,316,17950,29889,751,392,373,263,3984,427,2058,15093,4274,29892,373,269,29915,342,6309,1354,18413,980,343,263,553,2852,271,4110,1750,3390,296,2331,966,20368,1295,29892,373,2947,11469,301,29915,1466,868,282,680,29889,8748,301,29915,19986,29211,2947,11113,276,427,2181,2487,13017,2131,20110,29889,1551,263,24889,29948,1597,1650,427,626,347,427,2058,553,8774,3068,1608,267,316,4313,12161,29892,454,27965,1314,1616,1387,29871,29955,260,29899,29872,1314,29889,4546,29875,1601,1203,361,1465,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,1354,432,29915,852,2970,316,4313,30069,1358,454,4313,12161,2123,868,11387,316,966,20368,1295,29889,6803,409,9073,5646,270,29915,24430,29892,432,29915,1794,17134,301,29915,711,4026,868,4313,12161,29889,751,392,373,610,280,316,16158,16909,347,29892,610,17488,373,302,29915,29874,2331,9411,966,286,30037,4467,26192,29889,951,17284,427,17950,2947,707,4193,712,425,16158,16909,347,274,29915,342,7848,904,6092,29889,8748,1597,10098,712,7890,29871,22730,904,6092,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,9073,4963,942,5646,2257,712,7890,28078,11867,29889,3872,29883,1671,1437,4951,381,553,1437,4951,2187,2298,782,11387,1136,575,2491,316,7015,451,1080,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,3479,1426,267,16772,29876,1379,316,521,562,348,553,2852,271,1860,29892,3503,5695,782,18848,868,3623,479,4797,1465,966,6361,1041,712,1444,286,29915,18949,4637,29892,634,782,18848,868,3623,479,17611,264,29889,1551,18331,2298,782,11387,11469,553,1437,4951,2187,316,269,29915,5753,28031,316,553,20368,1295,29892,14864,966,3300,861,553,266,2249,19669,29892,274,29915,342,2331,2258,21873,29892,1661,29892,6836,18331,29889,1551,18331,818,1597,18768,1139,21394,2298,7930,457,1509,29889,951,4313,12161,1465,301,29915,13094,18165,484,29899,29873,29899,309,29889,24674,29891,29899,20519,29889,10050,29889,10050,610,346,712,782,13003,316,9073,1970,8837,818,443,3623,479,29892,373,263,5246,1970,8837,782,17284,553,2852,271,1860,1671,4313,30069,1358,373,623,1808,29871,4277,454,4313,12161,11398,29889,1720,409,1841,348,5582,1465,1597,6815,2930,10491,634,980,6309,818,15093,4698,737,818,425,18520,634,1224,316,301,29915,13094,29889,7867,29874,29889,28266,29871,29929,17478,29892,425,282,13835,263,3984,818,301,29915,442,9577,270,29915,20205,553,1644,13116,316,8740,267,29892,610,346,439,29915,309,452,3928,1249,2331,3479,9982,333,1064,271,1446,868,19397,427,2058,29889,2664,15306,4110,3435,1841,348,275,29889,1551,263,3984,553,1067,2518,30019,787,29158,4999,427,14913,11387,270,29915,2467,1671,301,29915,326,351,4983,29892,610,346,712,29892,274,29915,342,443,1437,29890,2029,482,13487,15819,29889,3872,29883,1444,592,26099,6309,29892,1444,325,1759,3686,2747,316,5814,5893,4239,29892,7732,27809,29889,365,29915,13094,1436,749,553,410,27499,1465,521,562,348,553,2852,1446,18490,29889,6803,339,7768,452,2331,3581,546,454,696,915,29899,262,29899,3470,262,749,1671,966,2852,1446,18490,1750,452,3390,10978,2331,966,20368,1295,316,301,29915,13094,29973,2581,16193,553,27809,29889,365,29915,524,1064,11992,
