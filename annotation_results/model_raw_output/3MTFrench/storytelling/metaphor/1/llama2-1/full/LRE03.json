For example, they compare the plant's growth to a child's development, using the metaphor of \"transforming\" to describe the process of turning waste into fertilizer. The speaker also uses metaphors to highlight the negative impact of chemical fertilizers on the environment, comparing their emissions to \"300 times more sent than more sense,\" and their effects on soil nitrogen levels to \"part(s) of the nitrate in the soil.\"\n\nThe use of metaphors in this transcript is effective in conveying information and ideas, as it helps to make complex concepts more relatable and easier to understand. The speaker's use of metaphors also highlights the benefits of using organic fertilizers, such as their potential to be more efficient and have fewer negative environmental impacts compared to chemical fertilizers. Overall, the speaker's use of metaphors in this transcript is well-done and contributes to the overall effectiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,712,425,282,533,29892,4191,29871,4277,29892,29871,4277,8164,7848,4046,1647,29889,315,29915,342,610,346,712,274,29915,342,443,12377,424,712,454,3814,452,8164,2331,3667,7608,29889,1720,21668,301,29915,4582,433,3055,479,2123,301,29915,29948,649,347,270,29915,6388,6386,316,1487,316,4327,261,29892,29871,4277,263,443,12377,424,712,454,3814,452,8164,3667,7608,29889,11948,29871,4277,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,1671,427,4665,316,9122,25235,6815,29889,365,29915,264,7316,316,9950,23285,424,20674,1387,782,13222,316,29871,29906,29900,29892,818,1597,6023,29899,305,4600,29889,5701,18765,29948,29892,443,3256,316,5802,316,301,29915,6727,575,362,29892,610,8474,29892,274,29915,342,9577,427,2779,272,29889,1720,7905,21394,316,1136,21871,2063,302,2445,5056,1671,301,29915,21813,17239,29889,1459,17488,29892,966,904,29885,6847,316,12642,818,20744,724,29873,29892,610,346,712,29871,29941,29900,29900,10098,2298,2665,712,2298,2665,712,7015,2030,267,29892,634,5695,553,760,267,868,21767,3605,782,19666,316,899,29892,1750,4625,3133,29948,1465,966,9709,400,374,19669,29889,838,943,29892,274,29915,342,439,7768,301,29915,1639,8356,316,9950,23285,424,270,29915,6388,1387,29973,2664,269,561,487,634,712,29871,4277,8164,7848,2298,6366,815,712,966,9950,23285,1934,316,20674,1387,29889,315,29915,342,443,260,4285,1671,425,6701,3234,440,2131,270,29915,28619,11387,316,760,267,818,301,29915,19809,11387,316,1136,21871,2063,302,2445,5056,29892,1465,454,3256,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,3318,361,316,286,29915,524,29948,5582,29889,315,29915,342,316,9073,427,5734,8376,316,301,29915,29948,2416,562,2131,29892,270,29915,4422,4371,316,301,29915,834,866,29892,316,966,19965,23285,1934,316,20674,1387,29892,1750,3435,818,2011,300,29871,1654,818,301,29915,279,1150,291,29892,634,316,1134,316,19965,23285,1934,2894,3783,1750,3435,5246,1190,2058,29871,1654,29889,951,25927,316,5073,316,301,29915,932,441,362,707,454,21261,344,1924,316,760,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,316,7890,8992,29920,20737,875,355,29884,553,9221,12906,371,1295,1750,22700,296,553,19965,23285,1934,316,2894,3783,29892,610,17488,316,285,2017,634,553,3778,2993,29889,315,29915,342,325,17016,712,2257,6079,712,8556,29892,712,29871,4277,302,473,29878,19047,6079,29892,454,899,634,966,715,3794,29892,3503,2331,8474,454,25179,506,562,2131,29892,634,454,19666,316,760,29892,274,29915,342,10440,8164,29899,5474,298,1893,1241,29889,751,29875,1671,8356,10420,261,712,966,1437,305,1691,316,274,3222,787,2123,6701,454,302,30069,2484,1671,904,29926,2853,427,17889,25235,4100,1671,454,19666,270,29915,29882,21522,318,509,654,634,316,966,1380,743,29892,966,639,1372,29892,29871,1654,1465,966,11179,567,316,508,1662,480,1037,818,425,364,29582,29892,2123,818,301,29915,28661,4555,553,10890,18032,1973,29889,315,29915,342,29899,346,712,302,29915,342,2331,712,427,274,562,271,1577,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,2831,278,7418,310,278,1301,924,4944,29892,591,674,1234,278,1139,15421,297,278,1797,372,5692,29889,13,13,16492,29871,29896,29900,29901,1551,263,6287,310,29871,29900,304,29871,29906,29892,920,437,366,14707,278,671,310,1539,12451,943,297,278,12032,310,445,1301,3395,29973,13,13,5856,29901,13,13,29900,353,1939,1539,12451,943,1304,29889,13,29896,353,4737,12451,943,892,1304,29892,541,28473,526,1950,29889,13,29906,353,4737,12451,943,17583,5439,21862,322,16710,8252,29889,13,13,29949,332,1234,29901,10831,29871,29906,448,4737,12451,943,17583,5439,21862,322,16710,8252,29889,13,1
