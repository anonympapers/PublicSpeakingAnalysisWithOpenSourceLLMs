The speaker uses metaphors throughout the speech to describe various concepts and ideas. For example, they use the metaphor of a network to describe the way people connect and opportunities arise, and they use the metaphor of an entrepreneur to describe the way individuals within an organization seek out new opportunities. The speaker also uses the metaphor of a machine to describe the way organizations operate, highlighting the interconnectedness of their parts. These metaphors help to clarify and explain complex ideas, making the speech more engaging and easier to understand.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,818,9411,29892,7890,29871,22730,966,6079,854,375,29889,20894,2353,29920,29899,4346,29875,316,7890,926,261,1597,1139,29889,6803,339,7768,7890,29871,22730,29899,27048,1577,438,1481,29892,1671,339,7768,7890,29871,22730,29871,1654,2257,29627,1671,15093,10019,1690,882,1577,349,1064,275,316,7594,339,29915,348,7890,263,610,12898,316,5792,1759,427,29871,29896,29947,29900,1473,267,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,29892,818,302,4479,29892,7890,2437,568,29920,1577,3938,329,29899,5474,29892,980,269,29915,23121,316,425,26744,8288,925,29872,818,21384,316,7890,2257,29627,1577,350,999,29892,1354,7890,29871,22730,29871,1654,29892,274,29915,342,23068,818,26814,28710,29889,8748,4377,29920,29899,23088,712,1465,454,25915,316,5792,1759,427,21195,316,26805,29892,1444,6427,8284,7175,3476,15471,1190,29871,4277,1190,966,11406,5441,743,712,8556,9411,29892,8556,15210,301,29915,459,424,29892,427,269,29915,513,25138,29899,265,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,1444,16133,1908,712,8556,1047,4467,9411,966,23440,1600,1295,316,18836,29892,818,425,23520,752,7273,573,270,29915,29877,3016,348,2131,1465,966,17459,800,29892,1465,966,23440,4637,29892,1465,966,27733,2535,966,339,1379,8556,11465,787,29889,4785,309,30001,29892,427,11172,712,14954,1173,1295,29892,19601,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,818,10741,4072,270,29915,22481,29889,1174,17488,29892,373,301,29915,29891,619,424,425,29452,316,24145,8441,29889,1551,966,619,424,16731,2298,316,29871,29906,29953,29871,29900,29900,29900,18554,1750,4079,425,22360,316,619,424,270,29915,348,9122,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,309,4079,1577,315,29915,342,553,18554,439,29915,265,452,7890,707,11387,29892,1750,707,443,5246,29892,19694,553,7456,1190,966,1841,344,2993,269,10183,1314,29889,16932,4079,6003,381,553,18554,270,29915,26283,9230,1998,1524,24145,8441,29889,16932,452,16193,3479,23440,4637,23428,574,5908,316,269,29915,13699,1639,1190,24145,14326,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,29892,11797,4079,29871,4277,867,8088,17334,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,1444,766,454,3184,2320,1387,29889,461,274,29915,342,1950,1577,6803,25497,276,818,2257,1134,316,1139,29892,432,29915,1794,4370,6079,17814,29883,542,15566,22781,29889,435,29915,1794,4325,9996,29948,966,1644,13116,270,29915,14056,558,1600,1295,868,28710,29889,435,29915,1794,966,904,1639,1493,12491,29889,435,29915,1794,9484,29948,1597,2967,316,21880,443,6314,424,2298,316,4239,6063,634,23690,270,29915,26739,800,5221,3794,782,13625,316,10741,12286,29889,951,6896,499,271,29892,443,878,15340,1750,1539,425,8220,782,1302,5411,553,17459,800,29889,7747,878,15340,1671,8356,1841,4068,1089,24145,2258,15529,316,378,2974,301,29915,711,275,3335,1559,980,14924,316,1437,4713,3709,966,11406,5441,743,29889,10043,1190,2062,9030,966,953,572,1372,270,29915,265,309,291,29892,966,18554,966,4348,375,452,3435,2331,1841,24579,1064,2406,29892,2284,267,29889,11948,11797,3435,8265,29886,575,2406,29889,1174,5246,29892,301,29915,22481,29892,966,2437,7719,818,301,29915,29874,1241,29892,966,10019,1690,4110,29892,818,553,4497,787,29892,11797,3119,30000,794,4313,2406,29889,8748,1874,261,316,5881,29948,1998,568,29892,17152,381,454,26138,18836,29889,1954,22094,29920,12866,1354,26814,2637,7734,7890,2424,1064,1318,29892,7890,5178,5495,325,359,18443,743,818,5466,3709,26814,26138,18848,29889,8526,9551,261,325,359,1178,2406,1513,882,29892,2123,818,26814,8455,29892,2123,6079,1354,7890,5052,663,29920,1671,966,11406,5441,743,712,7890,2906,26477,301,29915,459,29948,29889,315,29915,342,21907,1
