The psychologist uses metaphors effectively to describe the characteristics of the groups and to improve explanation. For example, when discussing the absence of the psychologist during the group therapy sessions, they use the metaphor of \"being away physically, but present virtually\" to convey the idea that even though they are not physically present, they are still connected to the group through the camera. This use of metaphors helps to create a more engaging and informative discourse.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,28079,454,9122,17043,13871,2257,439,29915,1808,29892,818,6267,1044,2491,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,1136,352,357,26814,25974,262,610,1998,29884,3479,12388,2925,634,6701,7848,1083,29890,2470,29948,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,4422,895,7015,26957,5722,11763,443,17887,21384,25595,553,2318,267,29889,838,943,29892,3440,1444,26099,274,29915,14386,270,29915,388,424,29973,349,5818,13545,8595,29892,1444,18848,11818,818,1601,885,283,29889,26383,4883,5321,20608,1041,29892,8556,1029,787,3984,427,2058,425,13219,2390,347,1773,361,1344,4379,1671,553,26943,427,13568,545,8645,424,29889,838,943,29892,3440,29871,4277,409,21714,29973,1551,364,465,6967,10741,5216,7545,1750,4625,316,330,359,344,2348,6947,569,634,373,13618,316,2318,267,1935,481,329,3783,15030,273,2406,29889,1174,1671,966,21038,29892,634,301,29915,18288,1671,6267,3847,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,26099,454,11643,1189,434,1465,443,11107,3847,284,29889,838,943,712,454,15744,1029,4564,29948,6079,29892,1444,766,19136,19844,611,11449,1791,261,427,3444,29889,6803,302,29915,342,2331,443,15115,265,1671,454,480,8107,29892,8556,1029,787,4224,24969,270,29915,29891,2420,388,634,270,29915,4422,7608,425,1998,29884,3479,12388,2925,29889,2726,555,1759,29892,1791,424,4824,8105,882,29892,623,1306,29948,29892,432,29915,264,7468,1601,11107,316,11825,610,4685,29889,11948,5278,29845,818,5418,634,16530,5289,29892,1444,29758,1601,11107,818,1601,885,283,23068,818,425,3949,6947,29889,1394,29892,7890,4078,29920,5646,2257,712,1465,425,12084,29892,21394,553,521,15806,21714,610,454,4880,29892,425,1400,545,29889,5334,17103,29892,980,592,21668,427,20255,1190,2058,1750,2947,286,29915,29874,1241,818,2117,357,12563,301,29915,29948,1217,1947,868,6361,482,17266,295,29892,439,29915,265,2947,18158,16455,643,21285,29889,360,29915,348,316,611,266,17449,29892,1444,286,29915,1639,307,479,29889,461,301,29915,6897,663,4824,1387,1465,454,11643,1189,434,6602,29872,966,1889,375,2318,267,29973,461,8164,29899,265,4327,261,301,29915,735,7018,29892,6773,29899,280,29899,348,29899,1484,895,868,11107,818,13310,443,24618,661,29973,2664,21426,6896,19718,8556,18443,296,818,2145,2853,29889,951,5246,316,409,1841,348,381,21285,29892,704,27084,966,27138,1147,5521,275,743,29889,16932,452,20423,2331,1791,261,818,269,29915,29891,427,15142,19398,425,3949,6947,29889,1459,263,26231,29892,373,409,7697,29884,16731,712,425,610,1772,868,15087,649,29872,263,21394,2298,270,29915,12352,1691,1190,301,29915,29948,3364,291,1465,2257,1134,316,11549,277,361,29889,6803,301,29915,2611,424,29892,8556,1029,787,1634,16555,10741,29540,1465,425,4292,1387,2318,744,29889,8407,13222,29892,18097,966,11825,452,452,3435,2331,10440,2299,1981,743,29892,11797,4625,10331,749,818,2257,21384,19507,1617,29892,818,553,1998,482,634,301,29915,786,455,29889,1720,18331,6701,712,454,11107,2258,30019,1943,427,289,2029,482,29892,634,3686,15802,316,286,29915,735,695,545,29892,427,367,16927,424,2637,23778,610,17488,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,18097,966,2614,417,29284,3435,5898,425,10505,29892,611,610,1772,707,9577,904,13147,1318,634,18916,1597,2653,9948,16133,6947,569,29889,478,681,301,29915,1351,29920,7199,275,29892,611,23520,707,5273,270,29915,1540,25698,2249,15819,24127,29892,1671,22025,1444,316,1564,275,534,8885,1597,1650,29889,11948,28194,8556,302,29915,6698,485,1080,7199,275,29892,14984,966,10042,1179,427,18342,296,966,2793,267,316,2257,11549,277,361,29892,297,264,794,29892,373,1671,336,9551,261,425,11643,720,29948,2390,347,553,2318,267,818,5418,29892,
