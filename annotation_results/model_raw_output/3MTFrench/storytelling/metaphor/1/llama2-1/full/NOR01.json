The speaker uses metaphors to explain complex concepts and to make them more relatable and understandable. For example, the comparison of the body to a machine that can be controlled by others is a powerful metaphor that highlights the exploitative nature of certain contracts. Additionally, the use of the metaphor of the gestation contracts for autrui (carrying a child for someone else) is chilling and raises important ethical questions about the commodification of the human body. Overall, the use of metaphors in this discourse is effective in conveying the speaker's message and engaging the listener.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,6303,1597,10098,564,9318,425,22577,8889,264,29889,422,1004,980,1841,29894,15340,316,316,15470,3165,9874,29892,425,7319,13241,3911,16193,443,4313,271,29889,853,904,492,29916,381,17748,1671,20744,316,4327,261,872,9521,316,8889,264,427,4239,289,4999,432,1117,267,29892,427,904,3167,316,4048,6390,427,29564,18062,29889,997,22577,8889,264,1035,2093,29899,29873,29899,30001,29892,634,425,7319,13241,3911,3581,412,818,425,25407,29889,478,681,7199,10281,1671,339,7768,454,4313,271,480,3268,425,2181,6693,7628,339,29915,309,707,1035,324,1318,782,2085,398,29889,11948,454,8714,29378,434,316,7890,364,465,9945,29892,452,7890,21714,2123,18402,8694,553,4313,1446,1190,24145,14913,29889,1459,17488,29892,28194,7890,7890,19643,29920,14255,443,25974,262,29892,18934,439,29915,309,12852,1597,26814,14913,29892,2123,6079,14255,443,260,20141,29892,18934,439,29915,309,22259,895,1190,26814,14913,454,3184,361,3060,10770,29889,2598,18848,1136,2488,818,16455,643,316,5419,4313,1446,1671,29873,424,1190,454,14913,3165,475,29892,18934,270,29915,1893,566,631,6267,805,4582,928,2131,29892,3503,26154,6267,4047,309,4279,29889,435,29915,1794,443,269,1241,1601,22917,439,29915,309,19947,270,29915,348,1298,3817,818,9411,7015,4313,1446,29889,10016,10788,362,316,7175,29899,342,279,634,1190,454,14913,29892,634,443,19397,1775,4894,295,24472,2265,1190,454,14913,29889,315,3100,1804,28821,712,301,29915,265,16374,15237,1539,2484,1487,14913,818,27963,270,29915,1540,26744,1671,12036,261,425,18619,362,29889,1174,18948,29892,5278,26744,24472,346,443,19397,1190,24145,14913,29892,4191,454,521,381,2007,819,1750,8164,19612,12416,634,2143,5218,4883,454,14913,316,1487,15935,29889,435,29915,1794,18158,17124,11555,14984,966,27264,793,11984,818,3999,4313,1446,29889,8748,18916,29892,27264,793,6299,1166,2122,634,712,8556,1998,29899,1066,787,270,29915,348,17950,3104,296,361,29892,1294,524,361,29889,29871,30219,29874,29892,432,29915,1794,18679,712,7890,427,3119,29948,311,29920,29892,18729,1804,28821,439,29915,30001,5646,3256,29892,7890,8992,29920,425,27829,2131,316,2970,29892,1661,29889,6101,454,260,20141,7890,5246,9201,3669,600,12416,29892,7890,8992,29920,454,17950,316,2143,1792,439,29915,309,20202,872,18619,362,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,1354,7890,302,29915,1351,29920,712,425,2730,26665,270,29915,1540,17949,316,5758,29892,260,403,6722,707,1190,966,282,30069,793,29892,1444,7890,5178,1924,270,29915,29948,1727,1358,14954,818,4239,10098,29889,2664,18741,267,316,9073,427,9073,592,15237,1597,760,316,27128,29948,29889,8748,1444,19760,7890,1029,283,261,439,29915,309,19947,553,4313,1446,9577,270,574,406,1314,29889,435,29915,1794,13214,2852,4749,29948,966,4313,1446,316,7737,362,1671,1120,582,29875,29892,26534,29884,818,301,29915,18949,4600,29889,1459,966,339,1379,1597,15096,14931,443,12377,424,8474,1841,24579,10500,29892,18934,316,454,1083,1803,276,3479,1899,277,7147,29889,12390,4313,1446,2411,30069,1372,3479,599,351,743,380,18949,275,3435,302,284,2073,800,634,27264,944,296,6701,872,6316,7916,13498,29889,751,392,818,301,29915,23578,424,29892,980,707,1020,2131,4191,443,13413,29889,12390,4313,1446,3435,10440,1006,29881,2187,454,20536,7691,29892,3503,1671,16731,270,29915,348,316,8714,29889,315,29915,342,1671,339,7768,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,316,7890,29892,3503,270,29915,348,503,2249,4582,13805,29892,1671,21285,29892,8556,1841,1558,1080,818,427,15570,261,2257,1374,1690,290,8146,316,8575,392,4371,29889,24337,14913,302,29915,342,6836,818,301,29915,29949,1690,819,818,325,903
