These metaphors help to create vivid imagery and make the explanations more engaging and easier to understand. For example, the speaker compares the texture of a particular type of tissue to a \"belle du monde,\" which creates a clear mental image for the listener. Similarly, the use of the metaphor \"la perle\" to describe the way the machine learns to recognize context is effective in conveying the idea that the machine is adaptable and can learn from different situations. Overall, the use of metaphors in this transcript enhances the explanations and makes them more engaging for the listener.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2664,639,2167,316,11062,30085,28898,29892,966,2298,289,4999,868,9122,29892,3435,904,4387,2406,14864,12694,1237,3994,5908,4191,425,260,8284,29892,425,13618,29892,425,3581,20519,29892,454,8092,15679,29892,966,260,294,316,425,7101,29889,1551,707,19120,743,427,29871,29896,29946,24797,351,4170,29892,316,319,1671,966,15378,1295,29892,11033,1671,966,11387,289,24729,29889,7747,3367,263,15237,4370,27965,647,27751,29892,3503,22572,29915,15669,29892,3700,818,425,3022,26841,20110,634,3479,5419,8182,790,1934,316,639,2167,818,3367,261,29892,966,2902,1372,4625,3008,28230,270,29915,1540,18872,5092,15826,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,373,452,872,277,2331,27922,29871,4277,29889,1720,21668,3667,7608,425,1596,790,482,4933,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,712,454,13003,316,27922,425,4933,1513,882,29892,373,3911,3023,1240,553,11875,2701,316,2257,439,29915,265,2453,329,439,29915,1808,3700,634,4875,16391,4875,29899,18202,454,19607,1750,2947,3911,19172,276,316,454,9073,29889,4241,841,424,29892,980,21668,425,8329,261,553,19966,575,316,534,8885,2257,19607,29889,13861,29892,6079,29899,23088,29892,454,2298,1437,506,271,29892,274,29915,342,316,425,7697,276,15390,270,29915,932,5606,8417,425,639,371,5898,9411,7015,21420,1998,29884,4999,29889,349,1267,787,610,17488,29892,454,8092,15679,270,29915,1540,639,371,29889,315,29915,342,2331,23422,15093,9565,1506,453,424,1750,707,270,30095,818,301,29915,524,575,2131,316,425,19703,5289,1841,1579,17192,347,29889,315,29915,342,5695,301,29915,4582,433,6094,16555,610,966,12814,267,270,29915,524,575,2131,29892,2123,10440,425,2723,2131,2535,22025,425,639,371,2143,20200,1487,12471,17239,29889,1720,21668,5695,16133,29539,553,4771,29892,425,2600,13469,332,316,425,1841,16041,291,29892,966,2258,568,316,838,417,29892,5646,29871,4277,29892,21181,712,1671,454,8092,15679,29892,21181,712,1671,443,20536,3994,1908,270,29915,29948,4387,362,29889,8748,1671,29873,424,29892,454,2298,1437,506,271,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,639,484,29889,951,2298,1437,506,271,29892,454,2298,4280,29872,818,623,5606,29882,1581,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,735,546,29889,2866,336,19211,818,425,4933,29892,301,29915,735,546,346,818,269,29915,21412,5469,29880,944,782,378,29149,316,534,275,29889,6340,707,6635,2445,7661,20423,8532,1197,29948,2535,2257,378,29149,29889,1954,351,17856,610,17488,29892,439,29915,265,7890,26427,316,3581,12416,443,7209,29899,29885,1803,276,29892,425,1667,29899,29876,29915,264,29889,8748,439,29915,265,7890,17792,427,12134,6635,2445,3842,610,4356,276,270,29915,279,3511,29889,422,29890,819,29892,282,1947,29899,5474,1465,425,8861,6635,2445,7661,29889,1954,351,17856,16134,424,712,274,29915,342,1597,15772,280,316,409,16391,1465,425,269,3498,29889,478,681,282,1947,29920,15237,7848,1465,425,8861,6635,2445,7661,29973,29871,30219,29874,452,269,29915,342,9541,309,1671,966,639,793,29889,317,4987,712,425,4933,452,285,1572,20480,1540,12694,663,316,378,29149,29889,6340,263,19445,818,3367,261,1465,443,378,29149,29889,6340,18062,2537,29948,1465,2257,378,29149,29889,365,29915,333,21659,29892,29871,4277,25810,3911,623,28759,5695,818,25238,13639,966,378,29149,29889,11948,29871,4277,452,269,29915,342,1354,9577,3911,285,2905,381,1597,260,1808,4323,2131,270,29915,735,331,552,316,534,275,712,274,29915,342,9301,427,544,15819,1671,966,639,793,316,260,1249,4285,29889,997,410,1173,712,432,29915,1794,9332,29948,1136,2488,818,260,5893,1841,700,533,782,7472,301,29915,6574,627,868,378,29149,2847,1190,454,3367,3105,332,29889,29
