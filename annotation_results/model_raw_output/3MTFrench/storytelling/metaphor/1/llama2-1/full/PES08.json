The speaker uses metaphors effectively to describe the characteristics of the comets and to explain their importance in the universe. The use of \"parment\" to describe the cosmic storm, \"rivée de guerre singulière\" for the comet's tail, and \"mélange de glace et de poussière\" for the comet's composition are all good examples of metaphors used in the speech. The speaker also uses a metaphor to describe the role of the comets in the formation of life on Earth, saying that they \"bombardé la Terre primitive des livrants leur matière organique et jouent ainsi un rôle indispensable dans les mergences du vivant.\" Overall, the speaker uses metaphors effectively to enhance the explanation and make it more engaging for the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1459,2460,966,1374,1690,290,22702,23428,927,29892,1750,385,2073,454,9122,19489,4196,29892,432,29915,264,17043,275,443,1750,29452,16530,20564,966,2298,16449,5820,14075,29889,997,610,362,270,29915,1540,17818,344,409,2453,329,301,29915,545,27973,1387,29892,980,3165,309,424,707,13310,424,454,325,568,805,271,4379,29889,838,943,712,23563,623,5606,15566,425,6562,29948,868,6683,6436,29892,270,29915,14559,2637,1365,1654,316,9577,286,585,1564,275,5814,482,29892,4191,425,9050,1318,316,12573,1809,29880,1647,29892,2123,425,5758,29892,270,29915,333,283,13045,15001,482,29889,2664,419,14228,427,1301,29883,3906,29889,16457,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,22572,29915,15669,29892,432,29915,1794,301,29915,28522,29889,8748,454,544,5903,29884,301,29915,29874,2231,316,7890,5814,5893,29892,12852,7209,5278,3300,861,29892,3060,30085,29877,29899,11631,29892,432,29915,1794,11021,326,29948,454,9587,29889,11948,2637,8556,29892,373,8164,425,2174,29415,7209,5278,3300,861,29892,2123,6701,521,272,1318,1671,966,938,1355,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,10395,420,302,29915,29874,2331,2653,7848,22847,22572,29915,15669,29889,315,29915,342,1671,339,7768,1444,325,1759,260,5893,316,1791,1981,261,454,2298,25947,30000,944,1950,29892,2257,439,29915,1808,286,29915,29874,1153,1285,29948,29889,2581,452,7175,29888,1908,7890,7175,15470,29892,10395,420,302,29915,342,2331,9577,4082,275,2535,966,8955,9230,29889,13861,29871,29896,29900,6063,316,17775,29892,24145,25947,15340,1487,316,5678,11300,29892,24145,427,18644,29948,23662,29892,263,1841,375,1039,818,16219,381,1597,20026,29889,422,1004,7890,282,6223,29920,454,8689,29892,29871,4277,2320,1531,818,1274,13300,357,316,8556,1841,12491,1358,454,640,4814,316,1487,274,16581,29892,443,286,3610,927,316,330,1265,634,316,282,681,1039,1908,29889,2664,286,585,1564,4637,6361,1041,270,29915,381,787,712,2257,3435,7015,3300,861,302,29915,342,712,1597,26379,344,16380,280,316,452,305,790,4999,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,282,1947,782,6761,533,439,29915,1808,707,3390,519,29889,1704,427,2298,316,6282,1089,26269,868,14419,309,29892,4875,263,301,29915,29882,30069,344,7209,2134,4630,29202,270,29915,348,7006,9201,16573,29889,8748,8182,4099,29920,29899,4346,29875,29892,26744,452,18062,316,330,1265,3700,3479,15570,3409,4110,868,25659,899,5218,29889,1174,20744,29892,818,23203,2131,316,425,1933,262,2131,29892,10395,420,269,29915,14386,521,28411,1318,29889,8748,818,3669,600,1358,5537,10460,553,260,24729,316,282,681,1039,1908,26269,270,29915,1808,29889,24337,25947,15340,1487,316,5678,11300,29892,427,263,2600,2131,1671,6314,261,634,16455,643,7015,2646,1144,316,282,681,1039,1908,818,425,29415,818,301,29915,314,9214,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,1639,558,1893,362,553,3483,952,267,302,29915,342,2331,10019,1693,439,29915,1808,1326,7081,270,29915,348,11395,16797,29948,29889,1720,343,263,1597,325,292,941,457,270,29915,812,2406,540,545,22527,29889,435,29915,1794,443,611,27963,1190,5061,276,29892,1597,5614,347,14670,29872,316,15093,11395,29889,2581,1236,1314,8532,301,29915,4422,7608,1671,16455,643,553,1775,4894,2993,269,13365,1849,818,19449,553,419,14228,29889,8748,5734,261,966,6896,19718,553,3483,952,267,2535,19449,553,282,681,1039,5908,844,28899,2658,29889,23719,1039,29892,425,5734,8376,316,21880,592,14924,270,29915,5903,293,1524,966,22183,1372,966,6628,1314,17161,2406,316,872,10067,391,1318,29889,997,12409,425,2298,13483,29892,274,29915,342,712,24145,394,2167,344,1162,1808,316,425,1775,5289,2894,1387,29889,10016,177
