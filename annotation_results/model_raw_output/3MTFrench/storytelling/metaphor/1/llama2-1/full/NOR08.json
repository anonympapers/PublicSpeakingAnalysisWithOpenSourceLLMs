The speaker uses metaphors throughout the transcript to explain complex concepts in a more intuitive and engaging way. For example, when discussing the creation of bio-medicaments, the speaker uses the metaphor of a paper to describe the process of creating antibodies. This metaphor helps the listener understand the concept better and makes the explanation more interesting. Additionally, the speaker uses the metaphor of a shadow to describe the behavior of antibodies in the body, which adds depth and clarity to the explanation. Overall, the use of metaphors in this transcript is effective in improving the explanation and making it more engaging for the listener.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,28266,425,26245,553,8714,29892,301,29915,21708,14954,1173,818,409,577,21216,29889,8748,8997,13545,4224,2108,583,29892,966,10283,293,20060,29892,13545,29899,27048,29892,8556,966,17043,790,787,29892,3435,6974,743,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,28194,7890,6454,10281,4439,1943,29892,7890,4788,29920,14255,26814,25974,262,1671,16219,381,553,10283,293,20060,29889,8748,6079,13545,2656,267,29892,611,266,17449,19172,336,316,9484,261,553,10283,293,20060,29889,11948,2331,302,29915,326,13732,7594,10283,293,1166,29892,443,17799,29899,2168,293,1166,29889,2581,286,29915,4548,9854,29889,2664,10283,293,20060,29892,7890,4191,966,4768,290,267,10283,293,20060,29892,3435,10135,374,339,743,610,301,29915,20041,2546,1374,22824,346,329,1387,29889,7747,13180,2257,3435,966,8774,386,2631,316,18187,362,1750,1874,296,29889,1174,20744,29892,966,10283,293,20060,23778,3435,10135,374,339,743,610,480,301,29915,735,985,291,316,1841,2467,20674,1387,29889,838,943,712,966,4768,290,267,10283,293,20060,23778,3435,10135,374,339,743,818,8019,270,29915,6388,6386,9364,424,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,432,29915,1794,3667,277,1597,3093,2004,9200,29899,21785,1387,634,9200,29899,9564,434,29889,8748,274,29915,342,1465,14344,29899,27048,439,29915,265,2453,329,9484,261,443,17799,29899,2168,293,1166,6079,28353,29892,443,3677,293,272,567,29889,19551,802,7890,6454,10281,4439,1943,29892,26814,14913,260,2016,316,2257,11482,9030,29889,8748,1671,18729,29892,980,2947,5469,29880,944,9484,261,553,3677,293,272,567,29892,15390,316,269,29915,29891,1999,29948,553,6062,29948,21337,6079,7175,3476,267,1671,1597,4439,328,347,14735,1318,29889,2581,872,275,966,1045,3246,29889,11948,1671,1597,4439,328,347,14735,1318,29889,11948,856,2581,325,1759,4880,261,29889,6803,1597,4439,328,347,14735,1318,29892,373,3686,15802,316,10135,374,7808,7015,3677,293,272,567,427,2298,6815,4323,2131,1465,270,29915,14559,5152,17893,29889,319,1436,29892,980,263,11878,818,1436,316,19397,1487,1089,553,18554,818,260,2016,316,15258,4439,328,347,29889,18410,2708,270,29915,14559,4625,29892,3503,980,343,263,11878,427,5246,1436,6311,29892,274,29915,342,439,7768,443,3677,293,272,567,1577,1720,325,993,6382,4983,443,3500,631,29892,443,3500,631,634,5541,29948,316,4239,13973,29889,478,681,8992,29920,301,29915,542,272,634,966,4239,7877,1750,992,993,270,29915,1540,2284,9874,3581,20519,29889,8748,6079,29892,443,3677,293,272,567,12450,5893,1249,427,21907,29835,301,29915,290,1030,868,3500,631,29889,1174,20744,29892,301,29915,3677,293,272,567,427,3911,29899,18202,12450,5893,1249,454,14913,868,3500,631,634,19601,2257,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,29892,2257,3435,966,4239,7877,29889,853,3500,631,427,7209,29899,295,452,1671,336,2331,1700,261,634,6079,443,3677,293,272,567,7209,29899,295,3911,452,1671,336,409,1209,265,1089,29889,897,2298,29892,980,707,4100,712,7015,7877,409,437,1505,434,6079,16784,895,29889,1954,22094,29920,16134,424,712,966,7877,2656,2073,577,275,569,1314,634,712,373,409,734,16219,381,553,904,3137,1766,21867,29889,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,18916,712,432,29915,264,20202,29889,341,1078,29892,427,21907,29835,29892,1136,2488,818,1874,261,425,3581,20519,553,904,3137,316,301,29915,3677,293,272,567,29889,8748,1671,18729,29892,1444,19760,5646,270,29915,24430,286,29915,524,1064,16136,818,844,22687,966,904,3137,1487,883,29948,29889,8748,610,425,9460,29892,878,361,26477,425,9200,562,802,1671,712,14344,29899,455,285,1509,1391,533,301,29915,3677,293,272,567,2535,966,7877,29894,2993,29889,315,29915,
