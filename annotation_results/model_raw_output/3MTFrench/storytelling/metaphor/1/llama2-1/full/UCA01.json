The question asks for my evaluation of the use of metaphors in the discourse of the transcription, on a scale of 0 to 2. My answer is:\n\nOption choisie: 2 (The metaphor is used effectively and improves the explanation).\n\nIn this transcript, the speaker uses metaphors to describe various aspects of life, such as \"the world is a stage,\" \"life is a journey,\" and \"time is money.\" These metaphors are used to convey complex ideas and emotions in a more relatable and memorable way. The speaker also varies the metaphors used throughout the transcript, creating a diverse and engaging narrative.\n\nOverall, I believe that the use of metaphors in this transcript is effective in enhancing the explanation and making it more interesting to listen to. The metaphors are used appropriately and do not detract from the main message being conveyed. Therefore, I choose option 2: The metaphor is used effectively and improves the explanation.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,966,9744,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,4944,1301,924,29892,306,674,1234,278,29871,29896,299
