{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-10T17:23:15.261274362Z","response":"\nBased on the provided transcript, I will answer the questionnaire as follows:\n\nQuestion 10: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you rate the use of metaphors in the speech?\n\nOption chosen: 2\n\nThe speaker uses metaphors effectively throughout the transcript to describe and explain concepts related to polymers and their properties. The metaphors are used to make the content more relatable and interesting for the audience, and they are also used to convey complex ideas in a simpler way. For example, the speaker compares the polymer chains to a \"longue chaîne de molécules identiques\" (Option 2), which helps to visualize the structure of the molecule and understand its properties. Additionally, the speaker uses metaphors to describe the interaction between polymers and their environment, such as comparing Monique's reaction to Arthur's touch to a \"mélange d'interactions\" (Option 2), which helps to illustrate the complex dynamics at play. Overall, the use of metaphors in the speech is effective in making the content more engaging and easier to understand for the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,26099,2793,270,29915,5474,29871,1654,19398,7890,29889,1174,4951,29892,1444,454,724,1794,10440,2298,316,1667,29879,29892,610,346,712,1261,475,29892,1444,452,610,275,427,11757,2925,29889,365,29915,29949,262,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,8556,1047,4467,316,2298,427,2298,10426,29889,405,681,24684,787,2923,25123,358,8556,27962,316,7015,22683,267,1045,30058,2167,11510,284,492,1912,29892,966,1029,1080,29889,11044,388,787,8532,439,29915,2719,8608,10978,2298,316,18554,634,316,1841,700,533,6267,10879,12471,17239,284,29889,997,1650,29892,425,10918,1908,29899,6772,29889,390,3451,4620,1318,23563,5541,1934,427,1223,631,610,553,1775,4894,2993,5541,3246,14924,316,966,7697,267,9291,29915,30001,29871,29945,29900,29995,2298,966,330,29889,1704,301,29915,9509,358,5882,316,7015,5541,3246,29892,274,29915,342,868,715,579,1387,29889,853,24324,261,29892,1597,24286,10329,28123,316,6062,29948,21337,2893,3783,29889,9353,1601,2280,29892,980,707,316,425,6635,2445,7661,553,1840,267,12990,332,455,1849,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,439,29915,309,1411,20752,610,1841,2467,20674,1387,18097,373,454,521,585,17615,634,1597,10098,3984,427,13618,29892,980,452,8164,2331,7848,1083,27224,1318,29889,2598,1840,267,12990,332,29892,443,3814,316,5796,415,545,633,7293,818,301,29915,28661,29889,951,760,269,29915,342,2281,332,29948,29892,980,263,1597,289,7293,16160,2131,14563,1387,634,8774,3068,1387,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,11498,707,13855,488,29889,1771,895,332,29892,285,790,545,29892,5796,415,545,29892,269,29915,284,535,29948,29889,11948,2331,316,7243,1387,29892,980,343,263,1601,1387,29889,2598,1387,263,5278,1597,14857,6635,2445,7661,316,24324,261,29892,443,1840,267,715,579,1387,29889,2598,1387,29892,6299,29892,707,316,6079,286,29915,29874,2540,5898,966,2258,1169,316,425,521,744,332,29889,12390,263,29899,29873,29899,283,29973,315,29915,342,10850,7342,4292,1387,634,904,4230,1387,29889,838,943,29892,16623,787,301,29915,6329,4325,9996,261,634,715,265,479,787,1465,6267,938,326,2131,29889,8407,5646,13222,29892,11498,707,1601,1387,7209,260,3906,6079,29889,1720,13618,21285,1597,1650,2730,1764,29892,7814,6299,1934,29892,17422,3200,26325,13805,29889,11948,18916,29892,432,29915,1639,29894,993,29889,2581,1601,371,425,5694,19113,316,6267,9892,802,25482,744,634,11498,1841,23121,29889,1720,2947,5443,261,7015,6062,29948,21337,29892,966,1597,3479,10890,316,2298,427,2298,325,568,29892,9291,29915,30001,4642,443,28710,427,7732,13391,29889,853,1840,267,12990,545,29892,12912,680,29892,19950,874,1821,29889,838,943,29892,2598,1387,452,409,2665,2298,818,872,2058,2637,966,13137,270,29915,442,1973,2123,3261,634,818,29188,1750,454,1841,23121,29889,8748,4875,2947,409,1539,2484,427,16380,280,634,9073,11179,1030,818,760,29889,8748,274,29915,342,610,5278,7019,862,362,712,2598,1387,263,270,29915,442,545,263,2304,29948,966,521,12332,29889,10050,29892,2331,904,29885,8194,20809,358,8774,3068,1387,29889,4546,29875,29892,5178,453,1908,427,8220,2637,24324,261,29892,1444,14954,1173,818,4313,30069,1358,301,29915,29948,4068,316,6267,263,794,545,21622,499,434,1509,29889,2581,1236,1314,29892,610,17488,29892,7697,276,2598,1387,2298,1098,381,1647,29889,1720,3911,1539,3018,13545,5697,1169,3184,10270,20674,3783,1750,325,609,6079,427,2174,533,11498,29889,6101,6079,29892,439,29915,309,2947,425,17161,261,2298,1472,27761,782,16573,316,3911,29889,8748,18729,2947,13787,2265,425,260,8284,553,409,9073,316,2598,1387,1465,425,3829,11498,29889,8396,29892,610,8474,29892,432,29915,29891
