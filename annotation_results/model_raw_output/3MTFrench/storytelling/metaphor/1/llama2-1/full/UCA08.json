I will answer each question in the order they appear in the questionnaire, and for each question, I will choose one option from the given options and provide my answer.\n\nQuestion 10: On a scale of 0 to 2, how do you rate the use of metaphors in the transcription?\n\nOptions:\n\n0 = No metaphors used.\n1 = Metaphors were used, but improvements are possible.\n2 = Metaphors effectively describe characteristics and enhance explanation.\n\nMy answer: Option 2 - Metaphors effectively describe characteristics and enhance explanation. The transcription uses metaphors throughout to explain complex concepts and ideas, making it easier for the listener to understand. For example, in the passage \"Là, ce gongel ça-la display de la covid-edge,\" the use of \"gongel\" and \"display\" creates a vivid image in the listener's mind, helping them visualize the concept being discussed. Additionally, the metaphor of \"the edge\" adds depth to the explanation, giving the listener a better understanding of the topic. Overall, the use of metaphors in the transcription is effective in enhancing the explanation and making it more engaging for the listener.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,365,30001,29892,2257,330,549,295,29871,4277,29899,433,2479,316,425,18838,333,29899,12864,29889,1174,11172,712,885,324,351,1004,29892,6363,712,18097,6701,301,29915,265,22259,1772,707,868,2195,1093,1805,29892,3965,787,427,443,844,397,537,29892,3503,980,30401,30663,5895,29875,29889,1720,8164,7251,30019,7848,1047,6067,1314,29889,1720,263,1750,1177,29968,707,315,29915,342,443,7006,2298,11364,712,966,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,12242,743,29892,373,2906,336,427,11469,1597,14857,7243,1113,446,29892,1597,14857,298,6844,29889,2664,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,1654,553,13698,316,425,1667,270,29915,634,17189,802,8556,26745,29920,454,634,301,29915,1540,260,29915,29874,5246,316,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,707,6974,29948,782,301,29915,18288,1750,454,14547,452,760,427,2217,1283,276,29892,2257,7426,316,425,678,542,4582,25810,782,6299,316,7697,276,2852,271,7081,18097,373,707,21751,29948,1465,454,1701,29926,482,868,29871,29906,29900,303,9766,2535,454,2025,634,8748,980,343,263,443,5246,270,29915,1540,19957,316,425,12260,1240,29889,6803,286,29915,326,13732,432,29915,1794,594,18616,2326,1076,29892,432,29915,1794,13417,277,818,394,2925,1671,9073,3060,2986,29899,367,29890,1318,274,631,11802,29892,2123,16892,1691,782,27895,25508,29872,10042,634,270,29915,18288,1465,454,6299,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,2
