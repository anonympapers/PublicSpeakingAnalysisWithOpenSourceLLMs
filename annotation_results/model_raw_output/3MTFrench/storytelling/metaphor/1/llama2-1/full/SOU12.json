For example, they compare the liver to a sponge that absorbs blood, a gorge that filters blood, and an architect who designs a new home for the liver cells. These metaphors help to explain complex biological processes in a more understandable way, making the speech more engaging and memorable. Therefore, I would rate the use of metaphors in the speech as high (2).","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,30219,29874,325,573,7890,818,439,7768,9080,26814,4732,1577,2169,2785,868,260,9373,316,17043,29415,11542,1465,454,13625,29892,13852,316,301,29915,4692,381,457,1671,22500,232,192,188,634,966,3184,300,21158,634,301,29915,6727,348,362,316,301,29915,284,1111,324,1671,7199,9030,454,1700,424,29892,373,3911,1098,1091,434,2298,316,29871,29941,29900,29900,10866,1953,29889,8748,980,302,29915,29874,2331,10440,7294,5606,9411,7015,22183,1372,29892,373,14954,1173,10440,22572,29915,15669,818,7199,9030,3058,267,316,7015,10866,1953,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,980,9378,381,1572,553,5291,29891,2993,634,966,3038,2540,868,1701,347,427,10212,20141,29889,12390,1518,4894,2063,270,3246,1597,13901,307,1750,7890,17043,5582,29920,8164,29899,5474,29889,1222,627,1577,11948,2331,1354,2560,712,29871,4277,29889,751,392,966,3038,2540,16158,1690,14748,868,14913,3165,475,782,10212,20141,29892,20554,452,3435,2298,966,286,30037,4467,29889,951,4325,3024,17239,521,1117,283,27275,29892,18834,29948,1190,553,28001,3814,267,634,7209,325,465,712,425,22259,4371,29892,4875,11113,316,6267,18165,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,966,3038,2540,409,3435,24889,29948,5162,11113,375,18097,966,6987,297,13901,307,3435,818,3681,29889,8748,274,29915,342,1671,339,7768,22572,29915,15669,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29929,29892,8556,302,29915,485,12628,15237,2331,316,878,15340,316,1701,347,5713,519,427,10212,20141,29889,2598,18848,13942,29877,2496,1597,15217,8774,386,356,1671,4185,2147,7015,3038,2540,868,1701,347,1465,553,5855,2298,410,6609,316,3038,267,316,14913,3165,2708,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,373,1671,8356,2970,712,1444,26099,427,21907,29835,1597,6956,29872,270,29915,524,14508,1750,14954,1173,818,1035,434,453,381,7015,3038,2540,1465,443,13164,1480,882,297,13901,307,1750,6267,7602,993,270,29915,2249,434,1314,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,1444,19760,17043,13639,10713,4883,787,270,29915,17234,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,7763,29899,23088,818,439,7768,18475,6967,454,26814,1701,347,1577,10016,904,1112,479,330,3890,29920,316,13625,29889,438,1481,29892,274,29915,342,443,15744,14117,1981,295,29889,6803,443,6956,29872,29892,3503,1444,1104,15792,454,1437,7241,29889,4785,1654,1601,15744,29889,2581,610,29879,868,1480,882,316,2967,29892,28643,8997,13545,8595,20737,29892,425,2653,346,29889,10043,270,29915,6574,575,339,29915,4999,2653,19047,29892,425,2653,346,29892,9200,29899,29888,333,1387,29889,1174,4047,293,650,29892,1301,862,2016,29892,2331,14954,29892,7101,4760,519,29892,29871,29896,29892,29945,7477,29892,782,29899,6144,30001,868,5646,29892,5898,2174,29888,898,29892,29871,29900,29892,29906,5654,29889,5791,1298,29899,3921,29892,443,285,3121,29892,425,29370,29892,1671,904,29885,1524,425,18342,362,269,2375,457,29889,478,993,18158,611,11943,1173,15001,1808,29889,2581,592,3165,569,301,29915,524,14508,316,5278,2653,346,270,29915,348,14783,468,295,270,29915,2499,5359,403,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,712,29871,4277,1577,10016,29835,1437,1112,479,29892,4191,14344,316,26814,2723,275,457,29892,5246,267,2535,443,1775,4211,265,271,318,2674,316,301,29915,2499,479,1771,1540,29889,2581,1436,275,2331,260,11355,643,14984,966,28001,868,899,29892,782,2174,29888,898,29892,270,29915,1540,6062,4582,1297,2535,22025,966,3038,2540,263,603,6079,269,29915,5753,307,4630,29892,454,5321,482,29920,29889,7747,17887,302,29915,29891,270,29915,283,453,381,707,818,301,29915,331,558,29948,818,1035,434,453,381,966,3038,2540,868,1701,347,29889,8748,1444,1236,1314,7890,2970,712,29871,4277,1766,1173,28185,9373,6079,29
