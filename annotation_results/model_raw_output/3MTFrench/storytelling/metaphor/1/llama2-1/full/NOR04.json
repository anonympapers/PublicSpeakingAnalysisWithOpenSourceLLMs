The speaker uses metaphors to describe the potential solution to the food crisis in a creative and engaging way. Here are my options for evaluating the use of metaphors in the transcript:\n\nOption 1: The metaphor is used, but improvements are possible.\nThe speaker uses several metaphors throughout the speech, such as comparing insects to champignons, criquets, and dentretiens. While these metaphors are creative and help to make the speech more engaging, they could be further developed to better illustrate their point. For example, the comparison to champignons could be expanded upon to highlight the nutritional benefits of insects.\n\nOption 2: The metaphor is used effectively to describe the characteristics and improve explanation.\nThe speaker's use of metaphors in this transcript is effective in conveying their message. They use vivid imagery to paint a picture of the potential solution to the food crisis, making it more relatable and engaging for the audience. For example, the comparison of children to dentretiens is both creative and accurate, highlighting the unique perspective and innovation of children.\n\nOption 0: There is no use of metaphors in the transcript.\nThere are no metaphors used in the transcript provided, which means Option 0 is the correct answer.\n\nOverall, I would rate the use of metaphors in this transcript as a 2, as they are used effectively to describe the characteristics and improve explanation. The speaker's creative use of imagery helps to make their message more relatable and engaging for the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,30219,29874,2947,343,7890,3440,302,473,12416,29871,29896,29900,3533,29875,3163,316,18554,4625,29871,29906,29900,29945,29900,1577,951,767,802,553,18475,2863,29892,13547,712,301,29915,14531,634,966,25999,364,3906,2923,25123,818,25179,787,344,818,5278,1139,29889,360,29915,1300,424,2298,712,454,21423,20196,5218,1044,2491,3911,6701,2362,29948,1190,1597,3667,4371,938,6270,316,7015,18475,2863,18916,29892,29871,4277,2947,2143,336,30058,914,4875,1671,818,12866,29585,19398,454,5161,802,270,29915,1144,29948,2764,2131,20196,5218,1750,269,29915,262,1947,29892,6309,29871,1654,13545,4224,2108,583,23422,29889,8748,1354,966,17564,267,15777,425,1650,1577,1174,875,5818,454,11387,17564,29872,29892,23563,4555,454,24889,283,29892,260,29915,264,724,1759,818,425,1248,262,4371,553,1153,29890,1759,29892,782,282,1387,332,316,330,3470,29872,29892,2123,10440,29892,782,18480,553,14783,339,1691,29892,1750,6267,3006,1249,4242,273,309,29892,373,707,26436,29627,1318,270,29915,7342,29889,838,943,19601,29892,18097,432,29915,296,1975,2257,20689,29892,1444,260,29915,264,364,1318,944,818,24145,3105,332,20196,362,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,7890,454,4078,29920,8164,29899,5474,2331,29892,3503,966,17564,267,3435,25763,966,3778,2993,966,2298,10042,29899,29881,1237,29892,634,966,2298,18254,768,10270,316,425,3814,12973,29889,16932,3435,18834,743,818,4595,29899,29881,17192,1808,634,8164,29899,5474,1597,325,336,347,8671,20196,5218,1411,519,1671,454,1136,3011,7289,316,1261,475,29889,997,15259,553,17564,267,29892,1465,454,410,6772,262,13901,9103,634,1375,6947,1314,29892,6267,9580,545,1597,20368,332,5478,2200,291,23497,1750,3928,782,3765,316,425,20368,332,5478,2200,291,23497,553,394,326,787,2299,1981,4999,29892,316,2298,29892,11797,12242,8603,296,316,29871,29896,29900,818,29871,29896,29900,29900,10098,11387,316,1437,305,1691,634,316,12642,818,20744,316,724,276,712,966,6957,369,2475,2872,29889,8748,6267,285,1794,569,26702,427,3144,29884,8204,14924,316,966,7175,535,7608,1671,553,6367,1355,2123,7171,2073,1671,553,1824,4467,10283,293,2993,29889,838,943,427,4771,21625,424,553,22299,20737,12036,743,1190,1597,4665,270,29915,328,352,357,19100,2941,609,327,634,373,20737,1597,639,1441,25235,302,2445,1230,316,5278,544,15819,29892,634,454,1437,3881,409,12789,284,895,1190,966,21038,29889,478,681,4788,29920,454,2970,1671,339,7768,29892,20554,325,23510,5646,1027,2037,29892,610,346,712,966,21038,29892,316,610,6267,5469,29892,11797,508,578,993,316,454,9122,2923,29948,1745,358,553,16157,267,29889,1459,263,26231,29892,11797,3435,316,5162,23386,2298,26893,270,29915,2559,586,362,782,2757,868,1701,7598,29889,478,681,301,29915,6698,26477,270,29915,264,7199,275,29892,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,17949,634,316,7199,9030,425,639,1441,553,21038,29892,818,301,29915,2445,538,316,7015,544,19669,29892,18934,270,29915,424,790,29875,546,634,270,29915,562,2388,18303,10713,29378,1041,3435,20299,4110,818,4875,29889,6803,2257,9073,29892,1444,1539,29879,301,29915,812,10646,8474,454,12042,2267,819,2535,553,21038,316,29871,29953,818,29871,29906,6063,634,7907,966,11469,1301,9695,29892,7015,2637,2034,575,452,14924,509,609,610,425,9460,316,1437,371,312,261,29889,2664,2114,11620,3435,269,14069,2406,29892,11643,1189,3783,634,9257,26020,589,9318,6267,1436,634,6267,17385,362,29889,838,943,1354,1444,16623,5646,29871,4277,29892,634,712,1444,3516,575,22572,29915,15669,1671,7890,454,1153,535,357,29892,274,29915,342,925,29872,1671,7890,2970,712,1671,1597,3814,12973,20244,634,1411,519,29892,1444,1153,14
