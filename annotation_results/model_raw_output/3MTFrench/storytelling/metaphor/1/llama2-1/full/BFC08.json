For example, the comparison of the company's work to a puzzle and the use of the term \"canary\" to represent the importance of protecting the workers are effective in conveying the message. Additionally, the use of the metaphor of the digitalized world to describe the potential impact of the industry on the region is also well done. Overall, the speaker uses metaphors in a way that enhances the explanation and understanding of the topic.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8407,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29892,980,6303,1424,29948,16011,316,5663,8885,443,508,1306,782,6299,270,29915,6727,335,1372,316,1373,6718,29889,438,1481,29892,432,29915,1794,6309,6079,443,508,1306,29889,10043,1671,626,1792,966,1375,2361,2535,3999,521,550,787,29892,3503,28185,9373,1671,966,410,6772,914,8474,1597,964,27375,362,29889,1174,5246,29892,1014,277,29899,29873,29899,309,3479,3479,26943,634,534,743,787,29899,455,7586,3479,904,29885,6847,553,12642,304,29916,3783,29892,9301,818,1437,371,312,261,1671,966,6063,29889,951,508,1306,269,29915,342,1147,29875,12866,4191,443,714,309,868,1437,29467,16784,1071,553,270,549,743,29889,5345,29948,911,707,1465,454,6701,378,29149,712,301,29915,1062,13857,7903,332,29892,269,4987,439,29915,309,269,29915,23121,2331,270,29915,1540,7903,316,1373,6718,29892,3503,270,29915,1540,7903,316,1016,2786,29889,8748,1601,17889,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,1062,29878,1908,316,425,17043,9948,818,8019,316,7015,14735,743,29892,373,3667,895,427,553,13698,29892,553,21082,19069,28119,29892,18934,316,9484,261,553,508,1306,4610,29884,4999,1671,544,566,381,425,11482,8837,868,21423,634,8288,3367,1875,10042,6267,7132,654,29889,341,13533,316,1016,2786,707,301,29915,14056,7734,274,6119,29892,1750,707,1597,2930,331,1004,2601,1318,1465,454,4662,29916,634,23662,15826,1465,425,18187,362,553,2930,17893,3345,12213,316,14857,16784,2459,29889,365,29915,370,271,29892,1444,6427,8284,2535,301,29915,24031,553,15001,1379,29892,13214,12255,29892,454,5544,519,25413,29892,2535,269,29915,12478,283,346,10767,29884,29892,1487,13137,316,6013,634,966,4191,21394,316,1487,25740,29889,1720,452,26939,2331,301,29915,524,1064,11992,316,1601,18848,29892,6701,980,282,1947,439,29915,309,707,297,329,488,29889,11948,610,8116,309,29892,980,11465,403,2535,19601,29889,1174,5246,29892,12255,707,443,14738,270,29915,4548,4894,663,29892,980,17043,277,5646,818,9551,316,7015,14884,29892,3503,18679,439,29915,265,707,1437,643,509,1481,882,634,24145,325,3246,344,868,3408,634,4046,1318,29892,12255,302,29915,279,4401,2331,818,15882,15237,634,25595,358,454,619,264,2637,301,29915,293,852,634,454,1136,29948,3910,270,29915,1540,282,30057,484,29889,306,455,18916,29892,2123,623,2518,13871,301,29915,5215,749,316,301,29915,524,28286,19069,11381,29892,1750,8164,1020,1524,2298,25595,358,634,2298,875,20564,2257,712,8556,4048,787,20737,29892,427,7483,21603,24145,1518,4894,663,29889,435,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,10042,316,6282,1089,4883,3093,3751,4467,29892,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,611,266,17449,610,2852,566,347,301,29915,2487,3409,29948,26318,29892,1750,378,2265,484,301,29915,16211,347,712,316,18165,17239,270,29915,6727,2945,29889,6101,21880,3435,16805,944,29892,373,2432,1875,1661,13499,262,2016,29892,1601,16731,29892,15382,898,1647,29892,2123,6701,867,2593,265,1089,1190,553,282,2754,414,29889,2598,1203,361,634,868,13436,11728,269,29915,342,27282,29892,626,15817,9386,301,29915,18721,1052,537,634,553,4511,743,818,8774,3068,1306,29892,18934,316,7199,9030,454,20299,882,270,29915,6727,2945,634,10273,2249,436,295,818,6628,1314,966,330,1064,743,29889,365,29915,264,1324,29884,9638,22781,270,29915,290,1131,749,707,316,7697,276,553,451,1080,4280,267,29892,13547,712,7997,3630,21082,19069,11381,29892,1203,309,29892,15579,1671,1597,282,1974,29872,4191,2522,18309,29892,18934,316,4325,1454,2265,872,752,277,440,2131,634,425,1539,2484,1190,301,29915,279,374,316,301,29915,20041,2546,29871,29896,29946,29889,29900,29889,1720,343,263,443,325,17016,15725,3165,475
