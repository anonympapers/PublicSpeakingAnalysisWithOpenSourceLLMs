The transcription uses metaphors effectively to describe the various situations and legal concepts being discussed. For example, the speaker uses the metaphor of a \"état du haut de sa souveraineté\" to describe the concept of state sovereignty, and the metaphor of a \"carte d'identité juridique\" to describe the rights and identity of individuals. The use of these metaphors helps to make the legal concepts more accessible and easier to understand for the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,2744,14997,643,425,1301,3395,316,425,2529,9854,14735,1318,1465,10014,2190,7187,24290,29889,6803,2257,9073,5278,16455,344,29892,4443,29920,454,10014,2190,7187,24290,427,18165,553,5155,868,868,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,6803,18402,1139,7890,8992,29920,7732,3987,584,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,29892,29871,29906,2535,553,1518,5795,1190,2257,712,12450,2016,5278,2984,1465,5898,29899,2042,6418,29911,27946,29889,478,681,452,316,13325,3060,275,381,439,29915,1540,25642,316,7015,3987,634,27516,425,1841,1713,5898,425,13618,30081,29901,8375,3060,24453,29901,29871,29900,29892,29871,29896,2123,29871,29906,29936,5027,1112,311,29920,3479,5155,1465,301,29915,19809,6722,20554,2537,24811,1465,454,660,4462,1254,2725,3521,29902,1525,29889,4514,14130,2725,3521,29902,1525,11759,16492,29871,29896,29900,29889,319,26814,1029,275,29892,1190,1597,21206,1808,316,29871,29900,818,29871,29906,29892,3440,904,1767,29920,29899,23088,301,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,1465,454,2313,2470,316,5278,1301,3395,1577,14094,27946,29901,6722,29871,29900,353,10043,270,29915,4422,4371,316,11510,481,2015,267,29889,29871,29896,353,997,11510,12451,487,707,3667,15826,29892,3503,553,626,15817,272,800,3435,6458,793,29889,29871,29906,353,997,11510,12451,487,4224,768,6366,562,882,966,1559,23096,634,626,15817,487,301,29915,4548,1414,29936,29962,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,11948,712,5246,29899,1808,316,325,9030,818,7006,17611,264,1577,2581,26099,11099,2488,634,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,966,260,294,14175,2719,29889,6803,7890,29892,980,452,269,29915,23121,3058,882,712,316,2560,11595,2131,19185,29889,1174,22259,2131,29892,966,260,294,14175,2719,29892,274,29915,342,6079,2298,712,29871,4277,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,24031,553,1044,267,1750,378,2265,484,26814,6316,316,26814,1055,9948,9291,29915,30001,26814,5758,29889,3185,29872,316,1055,9948,29892,316,15182,482,29892,316,4224,2093,29892,274,29915,342,26814,20206,270,29915,1693,2131,11099,333,1387,1190,22025,3435,28580,768,29879,9411,966,4441,1169,712,7890,8992,29920,1274,7680,5646,782,1472,316,26814,6316,29889,8407,2757,316,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,634,2298,16805,944,1465,454,9122,875,631,29892,274,29915,342,17950,1671,452,2331,7848,29892,452,3435,2331,13107,2249,2219,339,882,8265,29876,375,270,29915,348,2852,271,443,14857,29889,6101,7890,1437,8204,29920,316,1020,369,643,966,4565,29038,29892,1671,7890,27786,6701,8714,1671,20946,4193,1465,443,14857,9744,29892,443,2852,271,868,22916,316,872,3669,369,475,300,29948,29892,1671,443,2143,375,29948,316,25238,13639,443,1044,29872,29892,610,346,439,29915,309,452,3928,2331,818,872,26138,24228,29889,1174,1047,1004,29892,1465,2257,9744,29892,325,359,4441,1169,724,609,11113,375,29889,478,681,302,29915,735,1531,1249,2298,11099,333,8105,882,29889,405,29915,296,5705,8284,1136,2488,818,2852,566,631,7015,28374,18845,634,3686,388,6096,316,17124,4630,1597,2284,9874,29311,3381,553,27264,793,316,17950,29889,6803,10019,1524,29892,443,10395,420,6502,29892,15182,29948,427,3444,29892,425,285,30057,1173,1509,29892,4883,263,794,1973,29892,316,316,15470,10395,420,868,13185,29892,25074,16100,427,838,18453,29889,1174,11172,712,11099,2488,29892,432,29915,1794,553,714,2719,818,611,27963,29889,2664,13064,1080,6121,267,29892,966,27264,944,29879,17611,575,29892,966,1020,7719,29892,966,1437,3476,1080,316,425,6325,316,15426,316,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,966,22114,3420,267,316,425,6325,29211,29892,553,4441,1169,316,301,29915,21708,29889,6298,966,339,4999,29892,1444,286,29915,932,29884,347,1671,7175,2974,966,4441,1169,868,274,2049,11771,17611,264,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,1444,9551,1572,29875,6701,1597,1650,13149,744,29889,6803,339,7768,452,2331,9484,261,443,1044,29872,5412,1190,27612,25810,28580,768,29892,427,15017,2535,966,12503,29892,553,4441,1169,6299,1166,2993,29892,1750,452,1671,8356,18413,7848,1083,275,427,4556,29889,853,1044,29872,270,29915,28323,7631,17611,264,29889,11948,21181,302,29915,342,8121,29948,29892,634,4191,443,904,339,15943,276,2488,29892,432,29915,485,749,427,17124,13775,454,2923,25123,904,339,15943,276,2637,270,29915,348,21384,29892,966,3896,2872,553,12503,634,316,301,29915,18288,29892,425,17176,29948,553,4348,375,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,674,1234,278,1139,15421,408,4477,29901,13,13,16492,29871,29896,29900,29901,1551,263,6287,310,29871,29900,304,29871,29906,29892,920,437,366,6554,278,671,310,1539,12451,943,297,278,2313,10242,310,445,1301,3395,29973,13,13,8375,10434,29901,29871,29906,29889,450,1301,3395,3913,1539,12451,943,17583,304,8453,278,5164,18845,322,11706,22001,1641,15648,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3913,278,1539,481,2015,310,263,376,28323,868,22916,316,872,3669,369,475,300,29948,29908,304,8453,278,6964,310,2106,577,9359,335,593,29891,29892,322,278,1539,481,2015,310,263,376,4287,371,270,29915,1693,2131,11099,333,
