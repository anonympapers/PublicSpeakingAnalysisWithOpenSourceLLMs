The speaker presents some valid points about the importance of muscles in the human body and how they are affected by immobilization. However, the argument could be more convincing with more detailed scientific evidence and logical reasoning.\n\nThe speaker mentions that comparing the muscle of an orski-bern with the muscle of an orski-Ã©tactif would help to understand how the latter's muscles are preserved. However, there is no clear explanation of why this comparison is important or how it supports the thesis. Additionally, the speaker's enthusiasm for the topic and their use of colloquial expressions (\"our se bran\", \"gentillons\") detract from the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nIn terms of rigor, the speaker does not provide any scientific studies or experiments to support their claims. While it is understandable that the speaker may not have access to extensive research on the topic, more thorough analysis and evidence would be necessary to make a stronger argument. Overall, while the speaker's passion for the topic is evident, the speech could benefit from more detailed reasoning and scientific support.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,751,392,373,343,1841,1579,17192,277,29892,301,29915,473,409,20531,29892,980,343,289,837,29892,17256,818,29871,29955,17478,29892,9411,966,6063,634,19449,269,29915,264,289,692,261,609,29889,6101,1444,16623,443,25595,5734,25572,29892,301,29915,21708,1465,966,286,30037,4467,5855,270,29915,6727,12213,4371,25810,13547,944,21609,524,270,29915,5474,2706,375,1810,7147,1750,452,10503,440,336,993,2331,2298,316,7732,17478,29889,1720,707,4486,271,29948,433,280,427,18308,316,611,266,17449,29892,7199,9030,3440,301,29915,473,409,20531,29892,3911,7175,2140,1249,7015,2301,7799,29889,6803,639,2265,1487,7035,29892,5734,261,454,2301,2841,270,29915,348,470,2574,29899,5892,2535,454,2301,2841,270,29915,348,470,2574,29899,1893,627,361,29892,7209,301,29915,1466,443,367,585,13222,29889,8748,1601,521,5793,7905,2123,24889,29948,553,288,11620,427,5644,262,6628,1314,316,425,363,11992,26099,437,895,29889,405,681,1029,787,12866,4224,24969,270,29915,1808,332,7175,2608,1318,553,260,2993,5697,1169,25927,316,2301,7799,316,10098,610,385,29892,427,298,2147,634,427,4370,29889,1720,592,13472,8146,3999,16784,347,6394,634,8116,453,787,29889,2581,21953,818,611,3300,453,5793,634,301,29915,29282,427,17541,30037,29880,1318,410,6772,457,29889,11001,267,3435,2428,26842,404,3794,29889,7747,3435,966,5697,3246,19612,26536,1750,4079,18165,1089,14984,7814,3038,2540,29889,8748,1465,454,2301,2841,29892,20554,3435,270,29915,1300,424,2298,24151,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,1671,21181,712,966,263,2716,2783,316,2301,1810,362,818,659,553,4679,359,316,410,6772,1475,29889,951,26379,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,553,410,6772,1475,4625,4370,3533,4285,28374,634,712,316,3708,601,344,4191,1444,26099,29892,1444,2453,1314,4048,6390,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,2301,7799,297,278,5199,3573,322,920,896,526,15201,491,5198,12213,2133,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,367,901,17953,3277,411,901,13173,16021,10757,322,16667,24481,29889,13,13,1576,25657,26649,393,17420,278,2301,2841,310,385,470,2574,29899,5892,411,278,2301,2841,310,385,470,2574,29899,1893,627,361,723,1371,304,2274,920,278,7480,29915,29879,2301,7799,526,21634,29889,2398,29892,727,338,694,2821,8252,310,2020,445,10230,338,4100,470,920,372,11286,278,266,6656,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,363,278,11261,322,1009,671,310,784,417,339,616,12241,4852,473,409,20531,613,376,5362,453,787,1159,1439,1461,515,278,12463,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,797,4958,310,12912,272,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,16021,11898,470,15729,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,372,338,2274,519,393,278,25657,1122,451,505,2130,304,20607,5925,373,278,11261,29892,901,17826,7418,322,10757,723,367,5181,304,1207,263,23505,2980,29889,6811,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,363,278,11261,338,13602,29892,278,12032,1033,14169,515,901,13173,24481,322,16021,2304,29889],"total_duration":64582089784,"load_duration":238545,"prompt_eval_count":354,"prompt_eval_duration":32556815000,"eval_count":260,"eval_duration":32024398000}
