{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T16:59:03.996558282Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a persuasive message. The speaker provides some rigorous reasoning and evidence to support their argument, but there are also some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker does an excellent job of highlighting the issue of discrimination in the labor market and its impact on individuals with certain names. They provide a clear example of how someone with the name \"Emilie\" is more likely to be chosen for a job than someone with the name \"Vincent.\" This is a powerful illustration of the point they are making.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened. For instance, the speaker does not provide any data or statistical analysis to support their claims. While anecdotal evidence can be useful for illustrating a point, it is important to have empirical evidence to back up any claims made. Additionally, the speaker could have explored other factors that may contribute to the disparities in job selection, such as cultural biases or unconscious biases.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does a good job of presenting their argument, there is room for improvement in terms of providing more rigorous evidence and exploring additional factors that may contribute to the issue of discrimination in the labor market.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,1671,29873,424,29892,1444,452,26099,2331,5374,1189,434,29892,1444,452,26099,2331,11643,1189,434,29892,1661,19601,1444,26099,23837,2488,29889,11948,301,29915,29948,4599,347,29892,7890,454,4078,29920,9577,6079,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,712,425,1436,749,29892,425,1439,371,29892,425,2181,895,29892,4326,1617,29892,5646,29871,4277,5646,29871,4277,29889,10050,29889,365,29915,29948,4599,347,29892,274,29915,524,29948,23458,5695,818,425,1139,553,2313,20386,800,1559,980,302,29915,342,2331,6366,815,23837,8105,882,712,553,4348,375,577,993,2313,20386,743,29892,1436,19047,610,7848,1480,29948,818,425,13943,561,4745,316,425,8441,634,707,2298,316,5189,743,818,409,7697,276,1190,6267,13003,316,29231,5495,29889,26383,2257,1134,270,29915,1893,1151,12866,29892,373,263,1354,2298,7697,29884,16731,712,29892,19601,29899,18202,29892,925,29872,818,4556,316,1487,544,1690,290,29892,7905,4239,10098,11387,316,8825,270,29915,711,841,381,1597,1841,1713,712,19748,29889,438,29884,10440,712,25458,347,6303,425,2298,18484,3060,10770,25763,7015,7732,4348,375,29892,3503,5646,1326,993,5278,12694,663,316,1020,17334,29889,1551,707,5246,1671,16455,643,1671,946,381,1671,28640,276,425,2313,5632,3381,634,301,29915,18704,269,29915,404,5218,1465,17043,13639,966,9946,29889,6101,7890,1437,8204,29920,316,3060,275,381,25458,347,610,17488,29892,707,29899,346,712,18729,2453,329,2970,712,7890,29871,22730,7916,2488,818,966,7171,311,19748,2123,11021,2488,818,966,7171,311,782,17478,29899,29885,14785,1577,382,29882,6079,1661,29892,2331,363,29883,15471,29892,7890,9577,6079,1437,8204,29920,316,3060,275,381,25458,347,1559,7890,16133,25138,712,966,285,790,787,2298,270,29915,26917,316,1970,8837,712,966,7171,30019,787,634,373,8164,2331,325,336,2073,7890,27516,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,20408,294,573,2643,29889,450,25657,8128,777,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,947,385,15129,4982,310,12141,292,278,2228,310,2313,5632,3381,297,278,10212,9999,322,967,10879,373,15724,411,3058,2983,29889,2688,3867,263,2821,1342,310,920,4856,411,278,1024,376,6026,309,347,29908,338,901,5517,304,367,10434,363,263,4982,1135,4856,411,278,1024,376,29963,262,1760,1213,910,338,263,13988,8632,362,310,278,1298,896,526,3907,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,848,470,24148,7418,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,385,687,6333,284,10757,508,367,5407,363,8632,1218,263,1298,29892,372,338,4100,304,505,29190,936,10757,304,1250,701,738,16726,1754,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,3902,4395,916,13879,393,1122,29126,304,278,17508,1907,297,4982,9262,29892,1316,408,16375,4768,2129,470,443,3200,8802,4768,2129,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,29892,727,338,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,13138,901,12912,20657,10757,322,3902,8253,5684,13879,393,1122,29126,304,278,2228,310,2313,5632,3381,297,278,10212,9999,29889],"total_duration":84907644959,"load_duration":285624,"prompt_eval_count":355,"prompt_eval_duration":41243468000,"eval_count":293,"eval_duration":43663038000}
