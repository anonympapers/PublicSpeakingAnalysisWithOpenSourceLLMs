They use vivid imagery and metaphors to help illustrate their points, such as comparing the duration of a femtos second to the age of the universe. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that \"tous les méthons n'en ont pas la même structure,\" but they do not provide any evidence or explanations to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's argument that \"le crom pour un jour de venir noble\" is based on a rather simplistic and subjective assessment of the value of the element chromium.\n\nOverall, while there are some interesting ideas presented in the speech, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,302,29915,735,2488,2331,1465,425,5469,29889,8748,2257,455,29892,427,13545,4445,29873,359,1473,267,29892,1597,4445,29873,359,26617,29892,274,29915,342,1597,22577,15958,316,26617,29892,443,7284,29876,5000,316,3533,29875,538,9397,316,26617,29889,5202,276,358,6309,29892,1354,7890,16133,25138,301,29915,29282,316,301,29915,14540,1750,263,553,3533,29875,3163,634,553,3533,29875,538,8595,29892,321,29882,6079,1597,4445,29873,359,26617,610,13659,818,1597,26617,29892,274,29915,342,5695,8973,29892,439,29915,1540,540,545,610,13659,818,301,29915,29282,316,301,29915,14540,29889,315,29915,342,1874,882,316,3829,5528,4727,519,358,25595,29892,3435,427,868,1950,22572,29915,15669,23068,818,553,301,29915,29440,8494,336,29899,29883,2470,29889,2726,1652,1179,316,19703,5289,1750,452,270,545,712,13545,270,466,13116,316,4445,29873,359,1473,267,29889,838,943,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,712,7890,269,29915,30057,22067,712,9411,966,8774,386,787,302,29915,609,2331,425,6701,3829,29889,478,681,8992,29920,966,8774,386,787,9709,793,2535,553,12301,267,1750,363,358,3829,11071,634,13714,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,454,3209,553,8774,386,2631,270,29915,12352,17118,7608,610,425,5469,4191,454,274,456,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,9411,966,8774,386,787,302,29915,264,5152,27273,29892,289,1883,29874,335,29892,2123,427,3829,29892,274,29915,342,4191,29871,4277,29889,838,943,707,29899,346,712,454,274,456,1671,443,8694,316,6003,381,15996,1577,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,7175,3476,15471,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,13,13,1576,25657,22981,777,8031,322,2714,29899,16123,17223,7014,1048,278,5469,310,931,322,278,3829,310,4383,29889,2688,671,325,3640,6382,708,322,1539,12451,943,304,1371,28475,1009,3291,29892,1316,408,17420,278,14385,310,263,4445,29873,359,1473,304,278,5046,310,278,19859,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,376,29873,681,966,8774,386,787,302,29915,264,4625,2331,425,6701,3829,1699,541,896,437,451,3867,738,10757,470,7309,800,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,376,280,274,456,1671,443,8694,316,6003,381,15996,29908,338,2729,373,263,3265,5466,4695,322,4967,573,24809,358,310,278,995,310,278,1543,25173,1974,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,8031,7014,9132,297,278,12032,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":109356577231,"load_duration":261455,"prompt_eval_count":305,"prompt_eval_duration":30141452000,"eval_count":226,"eval_duration":79214188000}
