{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T23:15:01.235704057Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker does a good job of presenting their message in a clear and concise manner. They use simple language and provide concrete examples to help illustrate their points. However, there are some areas where the speech could be more persuasive, such as when the speaker is discussing the potential treatments for the disease. While they mention that there is no consensus treatment, they do not provide any specific solutions or alternatives. Providing more detailed information on potential treatments could make the speech more compelling to the audience.\n2. Rigor of reasoning: The speaker does a good job of presenting logical arguments and using evidence to support their claims. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, when discussing the potential causes of the disease, the speaker mentions that it is caused by \"jeux graines\" without providing any scientific evidence to support this claim. Providing more detailed information on the biology of the disease and the possible causes could make the speech more convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-structured and easy to follow, there are areas where it could be more persuasive and rigorous in its reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,4277,2947,9073,29889,5334,17103,29892,29871,4277,6454,915,6079,29892,611,266,17449,610,280,316,325,5753,3381,29892,1935,2390,19971,1750,269,29915,14975,802,818,1597,4439,328,347,20737,427,2225,344,29889,951,22898,4871,316,2257,18308,2646,457,29889,9070,29892,1444,872,275,29892,611,867,1924,25179,1893,654,29892,373,26939,2331,18097,1444,454,766,29889,11948,427,6701,8714,29892,274,29915,342,868,480,29948,1867,347,29889,315,29915,342,4191,904,699,276,317,771,10794,29889,8748,4191,904,699,276,317,771,10794,29892,29871,4277,3686,29874,347,712,425,16380,1173,29889,7747,1750,427,337,3703,1173,707,21394,2298,10812,1671,443,317,771,10794,29892,274,29915,342,712,29871,4277,3686,29874,347,5695,6896,434,1314,29892,286,759,29892,1153,1066,29892,992,533,6701,425,286,1682,802,2531,277,744,29889,2581,7890,1841,20752,2362,305,17856,712,534,1682,29889,323,29915,267,10814,1577,8396,29892,373,2947,1029,25856,10042,712,29871,4277,12852,6094,424,29889,6803,339,7768,343,29915,29874,712,29871,4277,302,29915,6698,585,567,29899,29879,547,1465,5278,4439,328,347,610,346,712,966,13830,872,339,453,1536,3435,6023,2406,29889,11948,5695,966,13830,1035,5632,2122,634,427,5246,29892,9411,966,2894,267,20423,7848,21609,9466,29889,16866,359,29892,21181,29892,21181,29892,21181,29892,21181,29892,21181,29892,1671,1601,5646,634,1597,19947,20480,348,1020,17334,1136,575,2491,1465,5278,4439,328,347,29889,315,29915,342,18097,432,29915,264,1006,1403,25404,29889,478,681,1326,29877,4099,29920,818,1601,13625,5419,316,1444,1314,2646,1475,4191,1465,14984,966,4439,328,583,4469,6727,7844,29889,315,29915,342,712,24145,13625,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2643,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29889,2688,671,2560,4086,322,3867,18387,6455,304,1371,28475,1009,3291,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,29892,1316,408,746,278,25657,338,5353,292,278,7037,7539,1860,363,278,17135,29889,5806,896,3585,393,727,338,694,1136,8841,14502,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6851,470,27809,29889,9133,4821,901,13173,2472,373,7037,7539,1860,1033,1207,278,12032,901,752,7807,304,278,20026,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,16667,6273,322,773,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,5353,292,278,7037,9946,310,278,17135,29892,278,25657,26649,393,372,338,8581,491,376,1324,1314,2646,1475,29908,1728,13138,738,16021,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,9133,4821,901,13173,2472,373,278,4768,3002,310,278,17135,322,278,1950,9946,1033,1207,278,12032,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,1532,29899,4984,2955,322,4780,304,1101,29892,727,526,10161,988,372,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,297,967,24481,29889],"total_duration":140391808819,"load_duration":262511,"prompt_eval_count":330,"prompt_eval_duration":33423221000,"eval_count":295,"eval_duration":106967706000}
