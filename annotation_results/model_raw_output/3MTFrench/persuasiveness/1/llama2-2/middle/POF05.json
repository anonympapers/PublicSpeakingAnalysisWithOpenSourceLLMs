{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T09:09:59.707568937Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker effectively uses historical evidence to make their case that the English influence in Hawaii was significant before the French protectorate. They provide concrete examples, such as the large number of American ships in the port of Honolulu and the presence of American sailors and traders in the islands.\n\nThe speaker's argument is well-structured and easy to follow, and they use logical reasoning to support their claims. However, there are a few areas where the speech could be improved. For example, some of the historical details provided are not directly relevant to the main argument, and could be omitted for clarity's sake. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more context on why the English influence in Hawaii was significant before the French protectorate, in order to further emphasize the point.\n\nOverall, the speech is well-crafted and effectively conveys the speaker's message. The use of historical evidence and logical reasoning helps to make a convincing argument, and the speaker's passion for the topic is evident throughout.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,26154,782,286,2249,14119,425,4889,316,301,29915,13453,29884,663,29409,1465,5278,2961,280,29889,4526,276,29899,1351,1924,316,23520,1190,966,3190,3145,553,282,12332,818,2011,316,8861,6896,499,271,29889,2664,23094,446,267,29892,4191,373,966,2245,655,277,818,301,29915,25165,29892,15777,20081,1465,966,17256,3190,666,1379,316,301,29915,627,2491,1248,1475,275,29899,29875,29899,7675,29883,2093,29889,8748,7015,2961,793,15777,14127,13116,10042,270,29915,5474,11076,29889,10050,2331,1597,8104,347,28763,29892,6701,1354,427,29871,29896,29947,29896,29941,29892,454,2085,17768,4699,7102,357,29892,10558,29916,29892,7814,9587,298,440,3163,29892,316,872,26138,14511,1230,29892,7209,301,29915,5753,536,316,7660,29892,1750,452,13267,29875,25404,2331,1487,1044,29872,29889,8748,7890,992,4099,29920,29871,1654,29892,301,29915,1540,553,409,7273,8310,1973,553,282,12332,6722,301,29915,265,24722,1399,336,3149,17153,29892,8024,29948,1190,454,20536,1766,7680,819,29889,11948,28185,9373,1597,9949,28763,634,443,10879,5162,10042,454,3279,10407,271,29892,634,301,29915,273,3559,610,966,1352,6899,29889,897,2298,29892,966,6411,1690,347,634,10890,6283,2658,14127,2708,15777,19445,316,29871,29896,29900,10098,2298,20081,712,966,6283,2658,553,10890,19079,1465,454,2011,316,3500,631,4370,2637,29871,29896,29947,29941,29946,634,29871,29896,29947,29945,29946,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,15839,10757,304,1207,1009,1206,393,278,4223,9949,297,26901,29875,471,7282,1434,278,5176,3279,2801,403,29889,2688,3867,18387,6455,29892,1316,408,278,2919,1353,310,3082,13968,297,278,2011,310,7906,324,21528,322,278,10122,310,3082,14892,943,322,3534,414,297,278,24191,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,1532,29899,4984,2955,322,4780,304,1101,29892,322,896,671,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,526,263,2846,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,1342,29892,777,310,278,15839,4902,4944,526,451,4153,8018,304,278,1667,2980,29892,322,1033,367,25811,363,7542,537,29915,29879,16563,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,373,2020,278,4223,9949,297,26901,29875,471,7282,1434,278,5176,3279,2801,403,29892,297,1797,304,4340,19310,675,278,1298,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,12032,338,1532,29899,17293,287,322,17583,378,345,952,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,29889,450,671,310,15839,10757,322,16667,24481,6911,304,1207,263,17953,3277,2980,29892,322,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,363,278,11261,338,13602,10106,29889],"total_duration":108889108647,"load_duration":253763,"prompt_eval_count":268,"prompt_eval_duration":26470333000,"eval_count":251,"eval_duration":82417878000}
