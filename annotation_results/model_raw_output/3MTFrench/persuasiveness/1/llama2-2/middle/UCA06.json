{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T03:39:56.333740086Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker's message is not particularly convincing and their reasoning is not rigorous. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of clear argument: The speaker does not present a clear and compelling argument for why they need to get the right address. They simply repeat the phrase \"the right address\" multiple times without providing any context or explanation.\n2. Inconsistent logic: The speaker switches between using the phrase \"right address\" and \"correct address\" without clarifying which one they are referring to. This inconsistency makes it difficult to follow their reasoning.\n3. Lack of evidence: The speaker does not provide any evidence or examples to support their claim that they need to get the right address. Without any supporting evidence, their argument comes across as unpersuasive.\n4. Ambiguous language: The speaker uses vague language such as \"the number of people you can take as a test\" and \"more Bulls that are off.\" This ambiguity makes it difficult to understand what they are trying to communicate.\n\nOverall, the speaker's message is not well-crafted and lacks conviction. They could improve their persuasiveness by providing clear and concise arguments, using consistent logic, and presenting evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1334,505,304,679,278,1492,3211,363,3553,29889,450,1353,310,2305,366,508,2125,408,263,1243,470,2828,278,1492,3211,29892,393,338,278,1820,304,278,1492,3211,29889,450,1492,3211,363,278,1492,3211,338,278,1492,3211,29889,1126,1286,591,505,304,679,278,1492,3211,29889,1334,864,304,1018,304,679,278,1492,3211,29889,1126,577,591,505,304,1797,278,1492,3211,29889,1105,591,505,304,1797,278,1492,3211,29889,1105,591,505,304,1797,278,1492,3211,29889,1105,591,505,304,1797,278,1492,3211,29889,1105,591,505,304,1797,278,1492,3211,29889,1105,591,505,304,1797,278,1492,3211,29889,1105,2845,278,17983,3734,29892,393,3734,278,1959,3211,338,393,9007,29915,29873,2805,3307,2472,373,278,1492,3211,29889,739,471,12530,714,746,366,892,9963,1048,263,2024,3884,29892,901,20293,29879,393,526,1283,1363,1906,526,310,364,4378,29889,2298,29871,29896,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,10734,17953,3277,322,1009,24481,338,451,12912,20657,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,2980,29901,450,25657,947,451,2198,263,2821,322,752,7807,2980,363,2020,896,817,304,679,278,1492,3211,29889,2688,3763,12312,278,16549,376,1552,1492,3211,29908,2999,3064,1728,13138,738,3030,470,8252,29889,13,29906,29889,512,3200,9696,5900,29901,450,25657,4607,267,1546,773,278,16549,376,1266,3211,29908,322,376,15728,3211,29908,1728,7542,9215,607,697,896,526,16811,304,29889,910,22435,391,3819,3732,372,5189,304,1101,1009,24481,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,10757,470,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,393,896,817,304,679,278,1492,3211,29889,13932,738,20382,10757,29892,1009,2980,5304,4822,408,443,6774,29884,294,573,29889,13,29946,29889,1913,3752,17269,4086,29901,450,25657,3913,25160,4086,1316,408,376,1552,1353,310,2305,366,508,2125,408,263,1243,29908,322,376,5514,20293,29879,393,526,1283,1213,910,22363,537,3732,372,5189,304,2274,825,896,526,1811,304,23120,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,1532,29899,17293,287,322,425,4684,7602,2463,29889,2688,1033,11157,1009,20408,294,20193,491,13138,2821,322,3022,895,6273,29892,773,13747,5900,29892,322,2198,292,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":59026887446,"load_duration":195523,"prompt_eval_count":182,"prompt_eval_duration":19141381000,"eval_count":293,"eval_duration":39884835000}
