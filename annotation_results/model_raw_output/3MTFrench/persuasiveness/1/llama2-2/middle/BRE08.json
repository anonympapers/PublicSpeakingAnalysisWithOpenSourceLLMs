The speaker effectively presents their argument and uses logical reasoning to support their claims, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more convincing.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of establishing their credibility by mentioning their role in determining the internationalization of local actors. They also use an interesting analogy with the paté and the times craint to illustrate their point about the uniqueness of the State as a player in international relations.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve their argumentation. For example, they could provide more specific examples or case studies to support their claim that local actors are not perturbing the monopoly of the State in certain domains. Additionally, the analogy with the paté and the times craint is not fully developed and could be further explained to make it clearer how it relates to the speaker's argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a reasonable argument, there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more convincing and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,20554,3435,16530,20564,5039,264,425,1775,5289,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,425,260,30057,1173,316,1437,18821,261,29871,1654,301,29915,273,725,1288,4371,316,7015,1044,11620,1180,2993,26030,13545,7006,22786,743,454,1601,459,1772,770,1387,316,301,29915,16061,1465,966,5354,267,13547,712,301,29915,29874,680,553,325,22156,29889,478,681,7890,26427,29920,8164,29899,5474,29892,3503,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,29871,4277,1735,712,2257,12852,301,29915,16061,2123,966,8478,7719,1887,267,1750,946,19047,1577,8748,6079,1840,568,29920,29899,4346,29875,1597,22577,15690,347,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,4191,454,2373,29948,634,454,10098,274,5270,29889,2581,7890,1518,9854,29889,1720,21668,6382,4983,425,20244,20110,4191,443,289,2029,316,10098,2646,29889,8748,14864,966,13219,3842,4655,277,7147,553,5302,6121,267,29892,2257,289,2029,25810,5541,29948,270,29915,348,2348,29878,2487,993,5412,634,12852,766,424,2143,4983,301,29915,16061,29889,2448,25810,29899,346,439,29915,348,1804,29884,634,439,29915,1540,8478,2131,1887,25810,10918,21998,1671,1139,1089,1597,11398,20110,316,301,29915,16061,1577,315,29915,342,325,17016,29892,301,29915,21871,27445,868,286,585,1564,275,748,7425,29892,4191,782,6299,316,454,2373,29948,634,454,10098,2646,29889,2401,7771,277,1738,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,22981,1009,2980,322,3913,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,10127,292,1009,6625,4127,491,3585,292,1009,6297,297,3683,2827,278,6121,2133,310,1887,29701,29889,2688,884,671,385,8031,3483,6933,411,278,2373,29948,322,278,3064,274,5270,304,28475,1009,1298,1048,278,20498,18543,310,278,4306,408,263,4847,297,6121,5302,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,3867,901,2702,6455,470,1206,11898,304,2304,1009,5995,393,1887,29701,526,451,22786,292,278,1601,13242,29891,310,278,4306,297,3058,21904,29889,19814,29892,278,3483,6933,411,278,2373,29948,322,278,3064,274,5270,338,451,8072,8906,322,1033,367,4340,10824,304,1207,372,26135,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,15590,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,322,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":119849440110,"load_duration":269034,"prompt_eval_count":255,"prompt_eval_duration":25767843000,"eval_count":248,"eval_duration":94077906000}
