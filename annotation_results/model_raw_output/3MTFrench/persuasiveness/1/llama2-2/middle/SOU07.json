{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T11:09:49.235361164Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and repetition to emphasize their points, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by making a valid point about the importance of early detection and diagnosis of intellectual disabilities. However, they then make a bold claim that a single mutation in a specific gene can cause the entire spectrum of intellectual disabilities without providing any scientific evidence to support this claim. This lack of rigor in their reasoning detracts from the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of language could be more inclusive and respectful. For example, they refer to individuals with intellectual disabilities as \"malades\" and \"patients,\" which perpetuates harmful stereotypes and stigmatizes these individuals. Using more person-first language, such as \"people with intellectual disabilities,\" would be a more respectful and inclusive approach.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in their use of rhetorical questions and repetition, their reasoning could benefit from more rigorous scientific evidence and more inclusive language.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,21668,9073,553,6987,13052,2063,29892,553,5697,3246,3408,29879,316,15358,29889,11948,373,452,8164,2331,1261,3825,443,12377,424,316,7732,6063,316,9073,553,3408,29879,316,15358,29889,838,943,29892,782,5246,29892,553,6987,6094,1893,3783,29889,11948,966,6987,6094,1893,3783,29892,5646,2257,439,29915,309,452,6309,29892,274,29915,342,29892,980,343,263,29892,782,2331,29892,1597,5478,362,439,29915,309,2117,598,29889,1720,452,766,2331,1354,5278,5478,362,4556,425,4439,328,347,29889,897,2298,29892,980,1302,30095,371,14954,29889,9353,611,17949,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,925,882,443,3209,29883,572,22781,316,553,285,6847,18715,29884,4999,29889,997,5478,362,270,29915,348,6063,29892,14344,29899,1885,29892,9378,277,1671,3269,261,5278,4439,328,347,1750,11943,1173,966,17137,634,1750,269,29915,932,1808,11482,1654,663,18715,13498,1661,22898,456,1387,29889,10050,22898,456,1387,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,712,966,25828,30069,4467,20423,564,3511,1465,16500,818,301,29915,18288,29892,2257,1750,707,7697,29884,454,652,21780,2923,25123,29889,951,1298,3817,18062,439,29915,2719,4625,9411,553,11101,7719,18715,29884,4999,3964,8675,2406,29892,11797,4625,868,4439,2535,553,260,30057,6609,316,425,6316,316,9411,966,16283,29892,4191,22272,634,9484,261,818,301,29915,1466,5246,409,9073,3999,21888,782,2320,13186,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,9297,347,316,534,8885,553,4768,290,5666,1295,1465,6267,13625,1671,1437,371,312,261,425,4439,328,347,2298,260,9373,1671,6628,1314,10259,18303,966,4439,3076,8288,712,6267,410,1173,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,21159,654,304,19310,675,1009,3291,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,3907,263,2854,1298,1048,278,13500,310,4688,15326,322,24876,19263,310,29762,766,11614,29889,2398,29892,896,769,1207,263,14288,5995,393,263,2323,5478,362,297,263,2702,18530,508,4556,278,4152,18272,310,29762,766,11614,1728,13138,738,16021,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,910,10225,310,12912,272,297,1009,24481,1439,1461,29879,515,278,12463,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,1033,367,901,20978,573,322,3390,1319,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,2737,304,15724,411,29762,766,11614,408,376,5156,3076,29908,322,376,5031,10070,1699,607,25722,29884,1078,10311,1319,269,12358,327,7384,322,380,335,2922,7093,1438,15724,29889,5293,901,2022,29899,4102,4086,29892,1316,408,376,25719,411,29762,766,11614,1699,723,367,263,901,3390,1319,322,20978,573,2948,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,1009,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,21159,654,29892,1009,24481,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,16021,10757,322,901,20978,573,4086,29889],"total_duration":59081415605,"load_duration":309559,"prompt_eval_count":314,"prompt_eval_duration":26530941000,"eval_count":270,"eval_duration":32549597000}
