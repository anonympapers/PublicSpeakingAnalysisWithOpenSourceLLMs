{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T01:41:11.79370989Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and for their reasoning to be rigorous. The speaker provides some valid points about the use of radioactive isotopes in medical imaging and the potential risks associated with their use. However, there are some areas where the argument could be improved:\n\n1. Lack of clear evidence: While the speaker mentions that there are risks associated with the use of radioactive isotopes, they do not provide any concrete evidence to support their claims. This makes it difficult to fully understand the severity of the issue and the potential consequences of using these isotopes.\n2. Unclear logic: The speaker's argument relies heavily on analogies and anecdotes, but the logical connections between these examples and the main point are not always clear. For example, the comparison of fur to radioactive isotopes is interesting, but it does not directly address the issue at hand.\n3. Lack of alternative solutions: The speaker mentions that there are alternatives to using radioactive isotopes in medical imaging, but they do not provide any specific examples or details about these alternatives. This makes it difficult to fully understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of these alternatives.\n4. Unclear tone: At times, the speaker's tone can be confusing, such as when they mention \"ça va être de se passer de ces isotopes radioactifs\" (it will be to pass on these radioactive isotopes). This can make it difficult to understand their intended message and whether they are advocating for or against the use of these isotopes.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid points about the potential risks associated with the use of radioactive isotopes in medical imaging, their argument could be improved by providing more concrete evidence, clearer logical connections, and alternative solutions to address the issue.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,373,623,1808,29871,4277,553,338,327,459,267,634,25763,7015,338,327,459,267,29892,980,343,427,263,1750,3435,7155,627,10270,29889,1174,20744,29892,544,27153,301,29915,735,331,552,868,3261,29892,451,29948,4595,29899,29873,29899,29888,29892,7814,289,24729,19397,29879,270,29915,485,3881,29892,966,1424,275,29892,443,5112,1759,29899,29926,787,29889,8526,425,12694,663,868,3261,1750,3435,16962,375,1465,966,12042,361,3780,29892,2123,1465,966,772,2719,427,14858,1579,787,29892,2257,3435,553,772,2719,7155,627,10270,712,301,29915,265,3667,895,427,1967,5198,2487,7163,709,29889,8748,4191,14984,966,289,24729,521,15806,1465,425,6316,29892,301,29915,2156,1387,760,868,4595,29899,29886,1908,29892,980,21668,427,1136,290,1050,2535,878,10500,29892,1559,818,9201,270,29915,852,29892,29871,4277,8164,316,15470,270,574,406,1314,29889,365,29915,18288,297,20580,1690,993,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,1540,10098,443,330,16555,29892,7814,772,2719,409,1301,1454,358,427,285,23458,1465,24145,14913,29889,8748,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,265,707,23422,15390,316,1437,371,312,261,966,772,2719,1465,24145,14913,29892,634,1661,2331,966,1424,4637,29889,5334,17103,29892,818,301,29915,28661,1044,13498,29892,5646,454,10329,28123,29892,29871,4277,2947,7848,316,409,27962,316,7015,338,327,459,267,7155,627,10270,634,316,3060,275,381,425,289,7293,1197,7342,316,3261,347,1750,8556,14924,9577,270,29915,5474,5820,1318,5646,782,1472,316,24145,16455,344,29889,8748,274,29915,342,12866,1671,25497,276,818,9411,7015,5697,1169,25698,19503,712,29892,286,29915,14975,7608,29899,4346,29875,29892,373,875,661,1173,23778,29889,8748,3711,19211,29892,1444,7890,831,1066,818,16454,425,1436,1513,29892,2123,29875,29892,3503,6427,4769,344,29892,373,454,6079,29899,1202,8105,1249,712,301,29915,265,2947,343,564,3511,29889,8748,274,29915,342,23068,818,425,796,866,29892,451,29948,4595,29899,941,457,29892,7814,289,17718,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,363,1009,24481,304,367,12912,20657,29889,450,25657,8128,777,2854,3291,1048,278,671,310,7155,4925,338,327,459,267,297,16083,6382,292,322,278,7037,5161,2039,6942,411,1009,671,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,16710,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,393,727,526,5161,2039,6942,411,278,671,310,7155,4925,338,327,459,267,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,8072,2274,278,2775,537,310,278,2228,322,278,7037,27721,310,773,1438,338,327,459,267,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,5900,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,15690,583,322,385,687,29881,4769,29892,541,278,16667,12368,1546,1438,6455,322,278,1667,1298,526,451,2337,2821,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,10230,310,3261,304,7155,4925,338,327,459,267,338,8031,29892,541,372,947,451,4153,3211,278,2228,472,1361,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,8671,6851,29901,450,25657,26649,393,727,526,27809,304,773,7155,4925,338,327,459,267,297,16083,6382,292,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,4902,1048,1438,27809,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,8072,2274,278,7037,23633,322,4216,1627,29879,310,1438,27809,29889,13,29946,29889,853,8551,16225,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,508,367,16051,29892,1316,408,746,896,3585,376,4277,2947,7848,316,409,27962,316,7015,338,327,459,267,7155,627,10270,29908,313,277,674,367,304,1209,373,1438,7155,4925,338,327,459,267,467,910,508,1207,372,5189,304,2274,1009,9146,2643,322,3692,896,526,22545,1218,363,470,2750,278,671,310,1438,338,327,459,267,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,278,7037,5161,2039,6942,411,278,671,310,7155,4925,338,327,459,267,297,16083,6382,292,29892,1009,2980,1033,367,16710,491,13138,901,18387,10757,29892,26135,16667,12368,29892,322,8671,6851,304,3211,278,2228,29889],"total_duration":86070929046,"load_duration":257958,"prompt_eval_count":390,"prompt_eval_duration":33197661000,"eval_count":423,"eval_duration":52872569000}
