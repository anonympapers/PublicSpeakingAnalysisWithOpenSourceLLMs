{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T14:01:55.927210574Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker does a good job of presenting their ideas clearly and concisely, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their argument more convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic of black holes and quantum mechanics before diving into the details of their research. This would have helped the audience better understand the significance of their findings and the implications for our current understanding of these phenomena.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker provides some mathematical equations to support their claims, they could have gone into more detail on how these equations were derived and what they represent. This would have added more depth and credibility to their argument.\n\nFinally, the speaker could have provided more examples or simulations to illustrate how their model of a black hole rayonnement works in practice. This would have made their argument more convincing and helped the audience visualize the phenomena they are discussing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas and results, there are areas where they could improve to make their argument more persuasive and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,28899,275,4323,1387,29892,980,343,26030,1597,22577,23950,2131,1671,712,270,29915,348,17103,29892,1444,592,5663,6223,316,425,21384,868,7167,29889,1394,22527,29892,8556,452,1047,4467,2331,439,3656,1912,29889,2866,336,19211,782,12111,694,381,29892,427,20744,29892,980,2085,915,13547,944,301,29915,267,3535,8714,712,425,2085,29890,545,707,4100,782,17887,5418,29889,3872,29883,1671,966,1437,699,276,29892,373,263,3008,28230,316,425,8310,2131,634,316,425,8774,3068,1387,4323,1387,29889,365,29915,348,2450,316,7015,4239,13219,3842,269,29915,932,1808,425,8310,2131,4323,1387,29889,8748,28194,373,301,29915,932,28759,427,16731,29892,373,14111,712,6701,1354,21181,452,269,29915,17192,29065,270,29915,348,12111,694,381,29892,11797,12242,8603,296,18097,6701,443,17887,15570,3409,882,29889,365,29915,331,3364,1318,29892,432,29915,1794,2852,4749,29948,443,878,15340,316,12111,694,381,1750,325,993,316,425,8310,2131,4323,1387,29889,435,29915,1794,5246,553,3408,29879,634,553,23876,1671,4048,6390,439,29915,1808,15570,3409,882,338,2249,12973,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,2653,5366,13325,3440,425,10505,290,18949,347,316,7015,12111,694,381,29892,13787,2265,6267,15570,3409,882,29889,10793,19951,29892,432,29915,1794,2852,4749,29948,966,373,2783,8310,7018,29876,4999,29889,7747,3435,553,5697,1169,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,7014,9436,322,3022,275,873,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,4628,26532,322,12101,7208,1199,1434,1933,292,964,278,4902,310,1009,5925,29889,910,723,505,9213,278,20026,2253,2274,278,26002,310,1009,1284,886,322,278,2411,5795,363,1749,1857,8004,310,1438,17292,28342,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,19475,10693,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,896,1033,505,7695,964,901,9493,373,920,1438,10693,892,10723,322,825,896,2755,29889,910,723,505,2715,901,10809,322,6625,4127,304,1009,2980,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,6455,470,23876,304,28475,920,1009,1904,310,263,4628,16188,15570,3409,882,1736,297,6944,29889,910,723,505,1754,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,322,9213,278,20026,7604,675,278,17292,28342,896,526,5353,292,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,2582,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":119875990995,"load_duration":246935,"prompt_eval_count":266,"prompt_eval_duration":24373580000,"eval_count":265,"eval_duration":95501575000}
