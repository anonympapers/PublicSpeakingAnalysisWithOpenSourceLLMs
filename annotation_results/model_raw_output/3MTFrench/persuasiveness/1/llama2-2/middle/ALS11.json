{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T08:09:24.38185932Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score the speech a 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker does an effective job of presenting their idea for biocompatible materials and the benefits they offer. They provide clear examples and explanations, using terms like \"superpoli\" and \"alloparticule\" to help illustrate their points. However, there are a few areas where the speech could be improved:\n\n1. Clarity: At times, the speaker's language can be a bit vague or confusing. For example, when they say \"en plus qui est biocompatible,\" it's not entirely clear what they mean. A more precise explanation would help to clarify their point.\n2. Evidence: While the speaker provides some examples of how their materials could be used, they could benefit from providing more concrete evidence of their effectiveness. This could include scientific studies or experiments that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of their materials.\n3. Concision: The speech could benefit from being more concise. Some of the sentences are quite long and complex, which can make it difficult for the listener to follow along. Breaking up these long sentences into smaller, simpler ones would help to improve clarity and comprehension.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speech could be improved, the speaker does an effective job of presenting their idea and persuading the audience of its potential benefits.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,818,425,20877,29948,29889,1551,269,29915,262,1028,533,21394,316,2257,7303,29899,27048,1671,10135,374,7808,553,6664,11992,4110,13052,1237,29892,439,29915,30001,2331,10767,29884,270,29915,328,29948,768,296,5646,29892,443,7006,4191,1597,784,434,4946,1808,1750,19172,8356,316,784,1358,818,425,10098,316,20491,7545,316,3500,631,2123,10440,4239,2894,267,3165,2708,29889,751,392,373,14954,1173,818,10628,7869,443,1775,4894,295,29892,1750,2653,5582,7848,427,6958,2535,443,21423,4768,20015,29892,4313,30069,1358,634,878,3709,2257,1750,409,21714,1190,3700,553,7618,1455,267,1671,10019,1524,5646,5161,802,316,304,27375,2131,29889,360,29915,29877,30071,301,29915,5215,749,316,13942,29877,2496,553,6664,11992,4110,17799,12667,13876,29889,838,943,29892,373,263,1841,375,1039,818,1035,5606,261,427,10212,20141,427,269,29915,262,1028,8491,29889,2726,29442,793,29892,1597,6062,280,904,1810,371,9577,18142,21101,1750,1661,23422,263,553,364,1446,6282,29892,3503,427,2298,1750,707,17799,23712,29892,1444,12450,2016,29892,2428,1248,29875,316,282,30057,2460,29889,997,1248,29875,316,282,30057,2460,274,29915,342,1597,29835,316,2428,3350,29873,2535,10741,2117,267,29889,1720,8164,409,1539,2484,5898,425,13618,270,29915,1540,12563,22577,16380,280,29892,443,2852,271,439,29915,265,623,1808,1597,25169,1595,293,1297,29889,1720,8164,269,29915,1893,18362,4191,443,2706,331,663,2123,10440,9332,29948,425,13618,270,29915,351,15340,29889,1174,5246,29892,425,521,347,1509,707,443,7006,4191,966,1766,29894,4999,29889,1551,707,12111,794,5644,262,316,2428,15001,1179,1671,8689,4805,536,21735,29889,1551,302,29915,342,8164,29899,5474,2331,5695,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,263,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2969,363,17799,23712,17279,322,278,23633,896,5957,29889,2688,3867,2821,6455,322,7309,800,29892,773,4958,763,376,9136,3733,29875,29908,322,376,26177,1595,293,1297,29908,304,1371,28475,1009,3291,29889,2398,29892,727,526,263,2846,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29901,13,13,29896,29889,15183,537,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4086,508,367,263,2586,25160,470,16051,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,896,1827,376,264,2298,1750,707,17799,23712,1699,372,29915,29879,451,9186,2821,825,896,2099,29889,319,901,18378,8252,723,1371,304,15544,1009,1298,29889,13,29906,29889,7298,5084,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,6455,310,920,1009,17279,1033,367,1304,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18387,10757,310,1009,2779,20193,29889,910,1033,3160,16021,11898,470,15729,393,22222,278,15332,322,6366,4135,310,1009,17279,29889,13,29941,29889,23924,2459,29901,450,12032,1033,14169,515,1641,901,3022,895,29889,3834,310,278,25260,526,3755,1472,322,4280,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,3412,29889,5826,5086,701,1438,1472,25260,964,7968,29892,13682,6743,723,1371,304,11157,7542,537,322,15171,2673,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29892,278,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2969,322,20408,9382,278,20026,310,967,7037,23633,29889],"total_duration":67317494964,"load_duration":182131,"prompt_eval_count":330,"prompt_eval_duration":30152533000,"eval_count":299,"eval_duration":37164217000}
