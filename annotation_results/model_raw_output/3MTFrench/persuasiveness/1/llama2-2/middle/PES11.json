{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T05:14:03.710189904Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does provide some convincing arguments and reasoning, but there are also some areas where the argumentation could be improved.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \"Paris, New York, Paris\") to emphasize their points and create a sense of urgency around the need for maintenance scheduling. They also use humor to lighten the mood and make the audience more receptive to their message.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve their argumentation. For example, they mention that they will \"anticiper les panne\" without providing any specific details on how they plan to do so. It would be more convincing if they provided more concrete examples or evidence of how they intend to prevent future maintenance issues.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or objections to their proposal. By anticipating and addressing these concerns, they could have made their argument even more persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some convincing arguments, there are areas where they could improve their persuasiveness by providing more specific details and addressing potential counterarguments.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,1700,29889,1459,17488,29892,3681,29892,1570,3088,29892,1570,3088,29892,3681,29892,3681,29892,3681,29892,5027,585,634,1465,2257,18987,316,1700,29892,373,5528,1908,553,715,1179,316,25413,1750,3435,553,13943,2631,5198,12213,275,800,316,425,325,713,311,1190,427,15617,744,4625,1437,8204,2123,1661,316,1083,13974,2265,553,20075,4110,29889,1551,3669,2350,568,8532,10019,1524,439,29915,1540,7243,484,623,2518,13871,7209,9201,316,715,1179,316,25413,29889,8748,4191,11797,325,609,6628,1314,7175,15470,29892,712,1410,4894,29878,29892,1444,325,1759,14954,4630,818,3677,1654,546,7015,7243,484,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,9580,29654,427,4239,29540,29889,28079,270,29915,24430,29892,1597,8576,316,7175,700,428,1671,4048,6390,18097,707,29899,346,712,2947,11469,13003,425,7243,484,634,1597,8576,316,4224,2459,1671,4048,6390,18097,707,29899,346,712,1444,1083,572,5793,1601,20075,882,29889,6803,425,8576,316,7175,700,428,29892,22572,29915,15669,29892,980,21668,4048,6390,712,26154,8556,1029,1080,29892,980,343,263,316,5697,1169,2117,371,1295,1750,427,29238,296,966,1700,2187,316,21880,4824,3783,29892,2649,267,712,425,5694,19113,634,425,544,1211,1465,1597,8280,29886,562,279,8399,262,782,9587,270,29915,348,1700,29892,634,1190,443,9577,4595,23396,316,1700,29892,274,29915,342,427,1727,22715,358,1597,24249,1318,1597,19340,3794,802,2967,316,21880,29889,1551,23990,336,301,29915,28661,1465,301,29915,14540,553,4802,848,29889,838,11867,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,16710,29889,13,13,1576,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,2177,275,29892,1570,3088,29892,3681,1159,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,1653,263,4060,310,5065,14703,2820,278,817,363,25413,28598,19478,29889,2688,884,671,27448,304,3578,264,278,286,2092,322,1207,278,20026,901,337,1547,573,304,1009,2643,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,896,674,376,424,1654,546,966,7243,484,29908,1728,13138,738,2702,4902,373,920,896,3814,304,437,577,29889,739,723,367,901,17953,3277,565,896,4944,901,18387,6455,470,10757,310,920,896,24042,304,5557,5434,25413,5626,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,704,24247,304,1009,24963,29889,2648,23483,1218,322,3211,292,1438,21838,29892,896,1033,505,1754,1009,2980,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,1009,20408,294,20193,491,13138,901,2702,4902,322,3211,292,7037,6795,25699,29889],"total_duration":137969400965,"load_duration":323009,"prompt_eval_count":294,"prompt_eval_duration":31468633000,"eval_count":274,"eval_duration":106499723000}
