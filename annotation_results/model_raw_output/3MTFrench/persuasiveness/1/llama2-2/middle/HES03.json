The speaker effectively presents their argument and provides examples to support their claim, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of presenting their case in a clear and concise manner, using simple language and avoiding technical jargon. They also provide concrete examples to illustrate their points, which helps to make their argument more convincing. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker does not provide any empirical evidence to support their claim that the press industrial can achieve the same results as a laboratory setting, despite mentioning that they have been able to achieve the same results as their peers at a distance of 200 km.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument relies heavily on the idea that the press industrial is an adapted version of the lab setup, but they do not provide any details on how it was adapted or what specific features make it suitable for measuring deformation. Without more information on how the press industrial differs from a traditional laboratory setup and how it can achieve the same results, it is difficult to fully evaluate the speaker's claim.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and convincing argument, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to fully support their claim.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,17887,24127,29892,1444,2453,1314,9073,4883,3686,1759,1190,3965,21136,1808,29892,611,266,17449,634,712,1444,1236,1314,2535,301,29915,524,28286,16035,1524,425,734,295,631,1671,2298,270,29915,513,6430,21642,29889,315,29915,342,712,432,29915,279,4401,2535,4883,3965,267,29871,29906,29900,29900,2383,316,22916,782,6701,6896,499,271,712,4883,5101,267,782,9775,327,29892,18729,592,534,8885,29874,712,1444,301,29915,1794,1950,1354,301,29915,265,592,434,29892,270,29915,29877,30071,409,21714,712,8164,29899,309,29892,316,11062,409,734,766,2818,434,1577,1720,832,29874,18916,1190,3999,3965,267,29892,443,2117,371,332,7744,29948,29889,6803,4883,9945,782,6628,1314,966,14231,16797,743,29892,634,2535,7732,1869,414,1190,301,29915,449,453,482,29892,1998,16100,29892,274,29915,342,425,316,5404,1750,425,2298,29188,29920,29889,1720,707,1518,1064,2073,271,29892,274,29915,342,3965,332,20075,29948,29892,1190,4239,29871,29896,29900,29900,2383,316,752,29948,1465,425,21258,29889,951,1243,269,29915,29948,1464,24697,2560,29892,3503,2331,5466,2488,29892,24618,3417,29948,966,20396,513,690,2637,4239,715,14947,275,29889,951,3023,479,332,2637,4090,276,29892,23068,818,5278,1518,4894,663,29892,966,1828,14228,868,878,15340,3477,488,818,872,10466,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,22981,1009,2980,322,8128,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,1206,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,322,4772,292,16905,432,1191,265,29889,2688,884,3867,18387,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,607,6911,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,3965,18408,508,6176,278,1021,2582,408,263,10212,7606,4444,29892,15020,3585,292,393,896,505,1063,2221,304,6176,278,1021,2582,408,1009,1236,414,472,263,5418,310,29871,29906,29900,29900,2383,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,278,2969,393,278,3965,18408,338,385,23430,1873,310,278,9775,6230,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,372,471,23430,470,825,2702,5680,1207,372,13907,363,7540,3864,316,5404,29889,13932,901,2472,373,920,278,3965,18408,2923,414,515,263,13807,10212,7606,6230,322,920,372,508,6176,278,1021,2582,29892,372,338,5189,304,8072,14707,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,17953,3277,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,8072,2304,1009,5995,29889],"total_duration":73455678959,"load_duration":318592,"prompt_eval_count":254,"prompt_eval_duration":28567021000,"eval_count":312,"eval_duration":44887680000}
