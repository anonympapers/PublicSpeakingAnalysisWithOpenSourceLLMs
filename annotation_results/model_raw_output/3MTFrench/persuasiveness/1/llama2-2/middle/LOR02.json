The speaker presents some interesting points and tries to make a case for the origins of Xenon in the Earth's crust and atmosphere, but there are some limitations and inconsistencies in their reasoning that detract from their argument.\n\nFirstly, the speaker assumes that the Xenon contained in the Earth's crust and atmosphere has the same composition as that found in meteorites, without providing any evidence or logical explanation for this assumption. This lack of support for their claim makes it difficult to take their argument seriously.\n\nSecondly, the speaker uses analogies and hypothetical scenarios to try to make their point, but these are not backed by any scientific evidence or observations. For example, their comparison of the Xenon in the atmosphere to a yellow color is not based on any real-world data or measurements, and their suggestion that the blue color of the Xenon could be explained by a \"mélange de bleu\" is purely speculative.\n\nFinally, the speaker's reliance on vague references to \"la chance spatiale européenne\" in 2014 without providing any concrete details or evidence undermines their credibility and makes it difficult to take their argument seriously.\n\nOverall, while the speaker tries to make a convincing argument, there are significant limitations and inconsistencies in their reasoning that prevent them from making a persuasive case.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1174,7017,13003,29892,432,29915,1794,3483,952,29948,454,1060,1690,265,640,4814,1465,966,696,6609,553,2600,13469,1295,316,425,18249,634,1750,1083,609,296,818,425,7101,427,2656,424,610,966,1700,339,1934,29889,26219,29892,872,15259,707,2893,1387,818,5278,868,1060,1690,265,953,558,2285,5483,1465,966,286,7342,272,3246,29889,1954,22094,29920,29899,29876,681,610,17488,712,2257,1060,1690,265,316,425,18249,634,966,286,7342,272,3246,12852,316,3581,20519,12337,1540,29889,8396,29892,1601,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,454,1060,1690,265,16474,1465,301,29915,1466,712,8556,4613,381,787,29892,712,13704,316,425,15489,561,1908,302,29915,29874,2331,425,6701,15259,29889,315,29915,342,4191,1354,782,13003,270,29915,5474,12337,1540,29892,980,6303,316,3581,20519,24241,29889,1394,29892,18097,1444,1072,19755,1190,611,282,26456,316,16868,545,29892,1750,12450,2016,425,4333,316,286,7342,272,3246,29892,1444,29758,868,12337,1540,29892,1444,29758,6701,868,16053,479,29892,1750,3928,782,12642,634,3984,610,454,14419,309,29889,11948,1444,29758,29892,6382,4983,9411,966,286,3610,6916,1950,634,454,3256,363,29883,15471,1597,11943,1173,316,10767,29884,1671,1518,492,7808,5278,3581,20519,24241,868,1060,1690,265,316,425,15489,561,1908,29889,1174,29871,29906,29900,29896,29946,29892,425,8825,805,271,4379,29211,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,3291,322,14335,304,1207,263,1206,363,278,1677,1144,310,1060,264,265,297,278,11563,29915,29879,2181,504,322,25005,29892,541,727,526,777,27028,322,22435,8244,2478,297,1009,24481,393,1439,1461,515,1009,2980,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,15894,393,278,1060,264,265,11122,297,278,11563,29915,29879,2181,504,322,25005,756,278,1021,15259,408,393,1476,297,27647,3246,29892,1728,13138,738,10757,470,16667,8252,363,445,11833,29889,910,10225,310,2304,363,1009,5995,3732,372,5189,304,2125,1009,2980,25798,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,3913,15690,583,322,13752,300,936,21846,304,1018,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,541,1438,526,451,1250,287,491,738,16021,10757,470,13917,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,10230,310,278,1060,264,265,297,278,25005,304,263,13328,2927,338,451,2729,373,738,1855,29899,11526,848,470,20398,29892,322,1009,8998,393,278,7254,2927,310,278,1060,264,265,1033,367,10824,491,263,376,29885,3610,927,316,10767,29884,29908,338,24837,1580,28524,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,12536,749,373,25160,9282,304,376,433,8825,805,271,4379,29211,29908,297,29871,29906,29900,29896,29946,1728,13138,738,18387,4902,470,10757,563,837,1475,1009,6625,4127,322,3732,372,5189,304,2125,1009,2980,25798,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,14335,304,1207,263,17953,3277,2980,29892,727,526,7282,27028,322,22435,8244,2478,297,1009,24481,393,5557,963,515,3907,263,20408,294,573,1206,29889],"total_duration":61673573753,"load_duration":181020,"prompt_eval_count":268,"prompt_eval_duration":22384127000,"eval_count":324,"eval_duration":39288756000}
