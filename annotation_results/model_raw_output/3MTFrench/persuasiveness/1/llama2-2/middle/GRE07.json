The speaker presents their research on the collapse of buildings with pockets of air, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker does not provide any empirical evidence to support their claims, other than mentioning that they have developed a treatment to measure the state of the building during its collapse. This lack of concrete evidence makes it difficult to assess the validity of their findings.\n\nSecondly, the speaker assumes that the problem is due to the size of the building, without providing any data or analysis to support this claim. They also mention that the gaps between the floors can be up to 30 stories high, but do not provide any information on the typical sizes of these gaps or how they affect the building's stability.\n\nLastly, the speaker mentions that a reduced model experiment in a laboratory cannot obtain reliable results, but does not explain why this is the case or how their large-scale experiment addresses these limitations.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents an interesting research topic, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by empirical evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,14344,553,772,790,787,29889,315,29915,342,7175,3476,15471,301,29915,711,4026,316,1601,18848,29889,6803,18402,10505,29892,1444,19760,7848,15390,316,285,2905,381,872,4323,2131,270,29915,29882,1064,296,661,2406,29889,317,29915,1131,8284,316,289,2540,11658,743,634,6267,1841,16707,427,18165,316,425,2600,13469,332,29889,317,29915,262,854,29884,270,29915,381,15749,29899,23088,29889,438,1481,29892,3503,454,25698,5000,707,316,260,8284,29892,1559,427,20552,307,309,707,9577,274,2131,29892,966,330,30000,5547,20423,6454,495,270,29915,1540,447,19072,316,2298,316,29871,29941,29900,2852,1179,29892,2535,443,1437,2966,5734,519,818,13704,868,337,264,2123,868,337,264,29889,853,878,15340,1841,700,277,427,10212,20141,452,14924,2331,270,29915,711,841,381,553,6896,19718,5713,519,29889,315,29915,342,1671,339,7768,980,263,5246,29899,29880,29915,29884,712,1444,1539,371,782,1298,425,2298,6815,1518,1064,2073,362,427,9122,1671,8689,454,10505,29892,872,521,1082,634,1487,27052,316,289,2540,427,1597,25642,10098,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,592,26099,818,439,29915,30001,443,610,3256,29892,1671,18729,29892,1444,592,26099,5075,1318,316,3949,6947,818,14857,1424,29948,3910,29889,435,29915,1794,16797,29948,443,1020,17334,3964,20372,1750,592,14924,427,5646,1298,316,425,521,1082,868,10505,29892,270,29915,711,841,381,1487,2852,271,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,5925,373,278,24382,310,13814,411,772,9737,310,4799,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,916,1135,3585,292,393,896,505,8906,263,14502,304,5645,278,2106,310,278,5214,2645,967,24382,29889,910,10225,310,18387,10757,3732,372,5189,304,24809,278,2854,537,310,1009,1284,886,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,15894,393,278,1108,338,2861,304,278,2159,310,278,5214,29892,1728,13138,738,848,470,7418,304,2304,445,5995,29889,2688,884,3585,393,278,330,2547,1546,278,5685,943,508,367,701,304,29871,29941,29900,15874,1880,29892,541,437,451,3867,738,2472,373,278,15662,15786,310,1438,330,2547,470,920,896,6602,278,5214,29915,29879,25806,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,26649,393,263,12212,1904,7639,297,263,10212,7606,2609,4017,23279,2582,29892,541,947,451,5649,2020,445,338,278,1206,470,920,1009,2919,29899,7052,7639,14157,1438,27028,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,385,8031,5925,11261,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,29190,936,10757,29889],"total_duration":146561397605,"load_duration":248201,"prompt_eval_count":275,"prompt_eval_duration":24750233000,"eval_count":269,"eval_duration":121810344000}
