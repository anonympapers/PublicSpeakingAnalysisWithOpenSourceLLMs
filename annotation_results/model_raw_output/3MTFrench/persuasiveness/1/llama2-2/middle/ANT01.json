{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T06:46:03.276536009Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and demonstrate rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker provides some logical arguments and examples to support their claims about the effectiveness of strategies to overcome disabilities. For instance, they mention the potential benefits of using auto-endorsers, such as identifying individuals with disabilities and providing them with appropriate support.\n2. However, there are some areas where the speaker's argument could be strengthened. For example, they do not provide sufficient evidence to back up their claims, such as citing studies or research that support their position. Additionally, the speaker sometimes relies on anecdotal evidence rather than empirical data, which can undermine their credibility.\n3. The speaker also seems to oversimplify some of the complex issues involved in overcoming disabilities. For instance, they suggest that simply identifying individuals with disabilities and providing them with support is enough to help them achieve success, without acknowledging the broader social and cultural barriers that may exist.\n4. Furthermore, the speaker's tone can come across as somewhat paternalistic and dismissive of the experiences of individuals with disabilities. For example, they mention that some people may be hesitant to seek help due to fear of being \"enfermed\" or \"dangereux,\" without acknowledging the validity of these concerns.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's intentions may be good, their argument could benefit from more rigorous evidence and a more nuanced understanding of the complex issues involved in overcoming disabilities.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,26742,2445,347,270,29915,8309,1361,293,481,818,301,29915,29948,10936,29892,2535,1597,1644,9874,316,5321,2445,423,634,301,29915,293,29948,273,316,748,7425,301,1132,267,29892,1444,325,1759,16455,643,7015,21880,966,4469,29899,355,9593,1295,29892,427,5246,29892,11797,325,609,343,7848,2893,6832,743,818,13310,553,5155,1056,2658,634,553,6987,11643,1189,3783,2123,4824,3783,29889,10016,10098,712,432,29915,1794,553,2893,6832,743,29892,1444,325,1759,19397,9551,261,553,6851,18934,316,966,10259,18303,782,6628,1314,1465,6267,439,9061,316,1841,1558,568,29889,18410,13116,6896,19718,316,611,23520,4625,2637,18376,301,29915,4422,4371,553,26742,2445,583,270,29915,8309,1361,293,481,634,4303,1064,7289,29889,10016,10098,712,432,29915,1794,1601,3966,375,29892,1444,26099,1437,25389,29948,316,3058,267,623,5606,29882,5580,29889,5202,276,358,6309,29892,1444,18475,296,11387,316,3965,1080,1998,29899,30001,29899,1730,316,301,29915,14930,818,9768,381,29889,2581,1236,1314,12866,592,10906,2265,29892,1559,427,3209,553,923,1912,432,29915,1794,1601,3966,375,5646,544,9061,29889,7747,13180,8570,29892,980,707,5646,316,6701,270,574,406,1314,316,269,29915,264,571,1050,1465,553,5566,6394,29892,1559,818,20689,29892,18729,8556,3710,30037,1173,270,29915,15127,19844,24145,18870,3104,296,709,29889,349,1267,787,301,29915,735,331,552,270,29915,348,7877,15792,29892,1559,980,2947,1487,7017,9587,316,301,29915,1131,362,29892,1750,263,301,29915,932,5606,29882,2673,316,301,29915,14531,29892,980,269,29915,342,2331,9577,6079,19406,29887,29948,29889,15113,270,29915,279,3944,344,29894,453,2131,29892,12852,980,452,325,993,2331,868,5646,29892,12852,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,22222,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,8128,777,16667,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,16650,583,304,25688,766,11614,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,3585,278,7037,23633,310,773,4469,29899,355,943,414,29892,1316,408,2893,9215,15724,411,766,11614,322,13138,963,411,8210,2304,29889,13,29906,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,437,451,3867,8002,10757,304,1250,701,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,7537,292,11898,470,5925,393,2304,1009,2602,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,6041,337,3687,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,3265,1135,29190,936,848,29892,607,508,563,837,457,1009,6625,4127,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,884,2444,304,288,874,13699,1598,777,310,278,4280,5626,9701,297,975,11506,766,11614,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,4368,393,3763,2893,9215,15724,411,766,11614,322,13138,963,411,2304,338,3307,304,1371,963,6176,2551,29892,1728,24084,3460,278,2545,1664,5264,322,16375,2594,26536,393,1122,1863,29889,13,29946,29889,16478,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,508,2041,4822,408,10579,2373,17196,4695,322,18918,573,310,278,27482,310,15724,411,766,11614,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,777,2305,1122,367,19066,277,424,304,16508,1371,2861,304,8866,310,1641,376,264,571,2168,29908,470,376,29881,574,406,1314,1699,1728,24084,3460,278,2854,537,310,1438,21838,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,7609,1080,1122,367,1781,29892,1009,2980,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,10757,322,263,901,4948,8362,8004,310,278,4280,5626,9701,297,975,11506,766,11614,29889],"total_duration":84241144127,"load_duration":265525,"prompt_eval_count":333,"prompt_eval_duration":34826752000,"eval_count":358,"eval_duration":49413594000}
