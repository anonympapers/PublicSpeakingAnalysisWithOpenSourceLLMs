{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T00:14:16.428001589Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker presents their findings in a clear and concise manner, using simple language and avoiding technical jargon. They also provide visual aids to help illustrate their points. However, the speech lacks a clear call to action or a compelling argument for why the audience should care about the research. Without a clear purpose or message, the speech may not be as persuasive as it could be. Score: 3\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker presents their research in a logical and systematic way, starting with the observation of chumurs and leading to the extraction of DNA from cells. They also provide evidence for their findings through the use of color and visual aids. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker assumes that the presence of red and green cells in the tumors is a result of mutations, but they do not provide any additional evidence to support this claim. Score: 3\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their research in a clear and concise manner, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,553,289,2029,29879,1465,425,3144,1647,5065,979,29889,6803,4048,6390,1671,339,7768,634,3440,5278,298,2017,332,409,13942,29877,4798,29892,432,29915,1794,2852,4749,29948,29871,29945,6063,316,521,398,332,16413,424,316,15935,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,4880,29948,316,439,7768,11797,3435,5541,743,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,432,29915,1794,3984,316,425,3581,20519,1190,5278,298,2017,332,29889,8748,29871,4277,18332,29871,4277,29889,315,29915,342,6896,499,271,29892,7629,276,712,7015,521,398,1295,3435,5541,743,316,28374,3038,2540,29889,8748,712,1354,274,29915,342,301,29915,1540,452,1391,895,2331,316,12563,316,425,270,29915,15664,650,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,4048,6390,1671,339,7768,1444,5366,1564,275,5278,904,357,9102,1690,2131,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,4805,277,425,25348,553,3038,2540,364,692,267,1750,1391,275,296,316,301,29915,328,15664,650,634,553,3038,2540,24241,1750,452,1391,275,296,2331,270,29915,328,15664,650,29889,435,29915,1794,5820,29948,553,5478,800,1465,425,25348,29889,315,29915,342,5478,362,29892,3503,274,29915,342,1671,339,7768,966,3038,2540,364,692,267,1391,275,296,427,9410,663,316,301,29915,328,15664,650,29889,1459,8474,29892,634,452,286,29915,4548,9854,2331,1671,339,7768,29892,432,29915,711,16349,553,3038,2540,364,692,267,634,24241,1465,7015,266,2017,1295,29889,3872,29883,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,316,2298,270,29915,513,1575,1671,4048,6390,3440,7015,266,2017,1295,409,13942,29877,4798,29889,315,29915,342,1671,29871,4277,712,1444,325,1759,5278,10098,29899,455,16454,2298,658,262,29889,8748,782,13003,316,4880,261,443,11107,316,3038,2540,29892,1444,325,1759,4880,261,966,3038,2540,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,1284,886,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,322,4772,292,16905,432,1191,265,29889,2688,884,3867,7604,263,4841,304,1371,28475,1009,3291,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,263,2821,1246,304,3158,470,263,752,7807,2980,363,2020,278,20026,881,2562,1048,278,5925,29889,13932,263,2821,6437,470,2643,29892,278,12032,1122,451,367,408,20408,294,573,408,372,1033,367,29889,2522,487,29901,29871,29941,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,5925,297,263,16667,322,1788,2454,982,29892,6257,411,278,15500,310,521,398,1295,322,8236,304,278,4805,428,310,25348,515,9101,29889,2688,884,3867,10757,363,1009,1284,886,1549,278,671,310,2927,322,7604,263,4841,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,15894,393,278,10122,310,2654,322,7933,9101,297,278,21622,943,338,263,1121,310,5478,800,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,5684,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,2522,487,29901,29871,29941,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,5925,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":64649726042,"load_duration":167638,"prompt_eval_count":346,"prompt_eval_duration":29129606000,"eval_count":285,"eval_duration":35519428000}
