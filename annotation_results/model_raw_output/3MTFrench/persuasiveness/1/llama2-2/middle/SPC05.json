{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T00:22:24.550376377Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does a decent job of presenting their argument and using examples to illustrate their points, but there are some areas where they could improve.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have done more to establish their credibility and expertise in the field. While they mention that they work on separating the delay caused by gravity from other delays, they do not provide any information about their qualifications or experience in this area. This lack of transparency may make it difficult for the listener to fully trust the speaker's claims.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have provided more concrete evidence to support their argument. While they mention that the signal may not have been sent or the clock may not have been accurate, they do not provide any specific examples or data to back up these claims. This lack of evidence makes it difficult to fully understand the speaker's reasoning and assess the validity of their argument.\n\nFinally, the speaker could have been more clear and concise in their delivery. At times, the speech seems a bit disjointed and hard to follow, with the speaker jumping between different topics without much cohesion. This lack of clarity may make it difficult for the listener to fully understand the speaker's message and be persuaded by their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does present some interesting points and examples, there are areas where they could improve in terms of establishing their credibility, providing concrete evidence, and delivering a more clear and concise message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,349,29940,7175,1365,277,270,29915,264,1365,7598,1465,301,29915,267,3535,29889,6803,6628,1314,7199,9030,634,1671,7779,7608,26814,3095,1893,277,10042,301,29915,23048,545,868,20487,300,29892,1444,7890,16193,316,5734,261,301,29915,14540,818,443,592,4951,29892,7890,1841,262,283,381,2535,7732,282,6430,3246,316,521,542,324,271,29889,478,681,301,29915,609,1841,510,558,26477,966,282,6430,3246,409,3435,8774,4117,3610,3246,29889,16579,802,1597,270,29915,14056,20554,427,1365,993,443,5246,1190,425,4022,533,3479,4239,10890,29889,997,5418,2637,966,282,6430,3246,274,29915,342,29871,29906,14746,316,20052,14228,634,12866,454,8714,316,1020,4026,316,425,19703,5289,425,4022,533,707,12471,29871,29947,330,29889,6101,16134,424,29892,11797,302,29915,609,1597,8310,7018,23497,21714,2637,4883,282,6430,3246,29892,454,592,4951,1597,298,2147,330,265,29888,280,10918,1908,358,4191,1465,443,3023,29889,8748,966,282,6430,3246,274,29915,342,454,697,966,1597,553,10890,29889,951,8714,316,1020,4026,270,29915,1540,282,6430,568,818,301,29915,18288,707,1874,29948,29892,4875,1804,744,425,4022,533,302,29915,279,4401,2331,818,6267,544,5903,29884,29889,838,943,7890,4788,29920,592,2970,274,29915,342,6079,5016,3274,15243,534,1682,3503,19601,1444,29758,5644,262,316,1153,14125,1750,1671,336,1518,492,7808,454,3240,538,868,425,4022,533,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,712,454,7182,302,29915,342,2331,17756,8532,29892,2123,6079,8164,29899,5474,712,301,29915,272,417,479,452,18332,2331,454,2684,29892,925,882,1601,18848,274,29915,342,316,7019,862,261,782,6628,1314,454,3240,538,868,3479,373,3874,29894,7018,9139,29892,868,3240,538,868,3479,10890,11482,1300,29879,29889,435,29915,264,2706,1219,802,634,2535,443,22420,7289,1444,1027,1297,1601,592,4951,782,282,6430,568,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,263,27189,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,322,773,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,2309,901,304,10127,1009,6625,4127,322,17924,895,297,278,1746,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,664,373,2903,1218,278,9055,8581,491,20953,515,916,628,1036,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2472,1048,1009,4021,8232,470,7271,297,445,4038,29889,910,10225,310,1301,862,3819,1122,1207,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,8072,9311,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,18387,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,7182,1122,451,505,1063,2665,470,278,12006,1122,451,505,1063,16232,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,1250,701,1438,16726,29889,910,10225,310,10757,3732,372,5189,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,322,24809,278,2854,537,310,1009,2980,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1063,901,2821,322,3022,895,297,1009,28289,29889,2180,3064,29892,278,12032,2444,263,2586,766,12090,287,322,2898,304,1101,29892,411,278,25657,12500,292,1546,1422,23820,1728,1568,16165,267,291,29889,910,10225,310,7542,537,1122,1207,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,322,367,20408,11932,491,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,2198,777,8031,3291,322,6455,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,297,4958,310,10127,292,1009,6625,4127,29892,13138,18387,10757,29892,322,12021,292,263,901,2821,322,3022,895,2643,29889],"total_duration":73161833059,"load_duration":188367,"prompt_eval_count":365,"prompt_eval_duration":30851439000,"eval_count":340,"eval_duration":42309694000}
