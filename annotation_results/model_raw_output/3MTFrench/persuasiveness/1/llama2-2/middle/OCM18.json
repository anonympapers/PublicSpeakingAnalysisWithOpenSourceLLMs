{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T06:18:12.623242265Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness in crafting a convincing message. The speaker provides some interesting and novel ideas about using cyberdoctoring to detect pollutants in crevettes, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or data to support their claims about the effectiveness of their method. While they mention that they will be using \"emprunte\" (a term that is not clearly defined) and comparing the biomarkers to a database of genetic information, they do not provide any details on how this will be done or what kind of results they expect to obtain. This lack of concrete evidence makes it difficult to assess the validity of their claims.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's argument relies heavily on the idea that crevettes have a \"patrimoine génétique\" (genetic heritage) that can be used to detect pollutants. While this is an interesting and innovative approach, it is not clear how this would work in practice. For example, how would the speaker determine which biomarkers are relevant for detecting pollutants, and how would they account for the potential impact of other factors (such as environmental conditions or the presence of other chemicals) on the crevettes' genetic material?\n\nFinally, the speaker's use of technical terms such as \"biomarcheurs\" and \"emprunte\" may be unfamiliar to some listeners, which could make it difficult for them to fully understand the speaker's message.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas, they could benefit from providing more concrete evidence and explanations to support their claims, as well as being more mindful of their audience's level of understanding.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,270,29915,497,814,267,29892,274,29915,342,1661,2331,1597,8825,298,3409,9061,29892,3503,425,20877,29948,316,24145,907,29894,2353,1750,2947,409,1437,629,1664,427,29845,316,1248,6092,1934,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,712,1601,18848,316,5094,495,1867,312,5411,24108,29889,6803,1437,371,312,261,553,4439,328,583,14255,301,29915,21708,29892,454,652,370,12973,610,17488,29892,373,2947,3248,261,553,6062,29948,21337,316,480,1037,29889,678,1759,425,907,29894,2353,29892,1444,325,1759,3248,261,10741,6062,29948,21337,29892,3503,5697,1169,5152,1080,818,7006,966,4768,290,279,1173,1295,1750,325,609,592,19172,276,316,17043,13639,1487,2852,271,316,20877,29948,29892,634,12866,316,4048,6390,1354,4875,263,4370,427,29845,316,1248,6092,1934,29889,997,11043,316,3248,482,316,7015,4768,290,279,1173,1295,8556,285,2905,277,1597,29835,270,29915,331,558,17316,29892,427,4951,1597,29892,2298,260,9373,553,3533,4285,29889,8748,1671,19397,1006,558,26283,7015,953,1457,524,267,29892,1444,16623,4191,425,10974,29892,1444,966,7252,818,1597,2967,316,21880,29889,8748,1465,24145,3209,29892,7015,21880,29892,274,29915,342,454,22191,26052,6094,19971,316,425,907,29894,2353,29892,2257,27965,1314,11033,29940,29889,951,4224,19177,29890,941,29926,316,425,360,29940,27666,553,14746,316,19313,712,1444,19760,2894,7608,1671,9484,261,611,2967,316,21880,29889,8649,4285,29892,14746,29892,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,322,9554,7014,1048,773,5094,495,1867,2801,292,304,6459,21180,329,1934,297,907,29894,21158,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,1009,1158,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,674,367,773,376,331,558,17316,29908,313,29874,1840,393,338,451,9436,3342,29897,322,17420,278,4768,290,935,414,304,263,2566,310,2531,7492,2472,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,445,674,367,2309,470,825,2924,310,2582,896,2149,304,4017,29889,910,10225,310,18387,10757,3732,372,5189,304,24809,278,2854,537,310,1009,16726,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,278,2969,393,907,29894,21158,505,263,376,5031,29878,26052,6094,19971,29908,313,1885,7492,902,16639,29897,393,508,367,1304,304,6459,21180,329,1934,29889,5806,445,338,385,8031,322,24233,1230,2948,29892,372,338,451,2821,920,445,723,664,297,6944,29889,1152,1342,29892,920,723,278,25657,8161,607,4768,290,935,414,526,8018,363,6459,292,21180,329,1934,29892,322,920,723,896,3633,363,278,7037,10879,310,916,13879,313,14565,408,29380,5855,470,278,10122,310,916,22233,29879,29897,373,278,907,29894,21158,29915,2531,7492,5518,29973,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,16905,4958,1316,408,376,5365,290,279,1173,1295,29908,322,376,331,558,17316,29908,1122,367,443,8302,4447,304,777,11621,414,29892,607,1033,1207,372,5189,363,963,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18387,10757,322,7309,800,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,408,1532,408,1641,901,3458,1319,310,1009,20026,29915,29879,3233,310,8004,29889],"total_duration":85279303541,"load_duration":282282,"prompt_eval_count":285,"prompt_eval_duration":29872537000,"eval_count":402,"eval_duration":55405866000}
