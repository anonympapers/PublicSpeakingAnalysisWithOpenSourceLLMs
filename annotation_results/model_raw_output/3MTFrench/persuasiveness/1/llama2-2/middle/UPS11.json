The speaker presents a clear and concise message, but their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported by scientific evidence.\n\nThe speaker starts by using vivid imagery to emphasize the destructive power of cancer cells, which effectively conveys the gravity of the issue. However, some of the claims made in the speech are not entirely accurate or well-substantiated. For example, the statement that \"un car des personnes ici présentes va développer un cancer\" (meaning \"one person here present will develop cancer\") is an oversimplification of the complex factors that contribute to cancer development.\n\nFurthermore, while the speaker highlights the importance of the immune system in fighting cancer, they do not provide sufficient evidence to support their claim that the immune system is not effective in eliminating cancer cells. A more rigorous analysis would involve examining the latest research and findings on the topic, as well as considering other factors that may influence the effectiveness of the immune system in fighting cancer.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's message is clear and impactful, their reasoning could benefit from more robust evidence and analysis to make it more persuasive and convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2298,21181,452,8164,3710,30037,4630,966,899,398,277,3794,270,29915,465,283,2405,6267,2298,694,381,553,263,5475,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,29892,282,5495,966,18475,2863,18254,768,3145,29892,409,6674,4926,29892,8104,7608,634,8829,801,381,966,2894,267,1671,4642,553,508,22543,29889,8748,20554,452,269,29915,331,558,347,296,2331,29892,1559,4439,28661,22527,29892,443,1559,553,18554,29871,1654,5814,5326,2947,13942,29877,2496,443,23900,29889,8748,25763,20554,29892,1597,1190,4239,263,2002,553,5478,800,316,282,743,262,12150,307,29889,11948,712,5246,454,21423,5198,348,9407,1465,301,29915,13624,29892,302,29915,18441,2331,19343,1318,2453,5495,1190,8556,29889,1174,5246,29892,980,454,5246,29892,18402,14426,7209,439,29915,265,8556,7697,16731,29892,980,521,5793,29892,5702,634,1437,509,3121,966,3038,2540,23900,6394,29889,323,29915,267,1597,27128,519,16987,427,5335,329,424,29889,11948,980,26030,6079,3008,28230,270,29915,348,17887,17103,316,19957,29889,1704,966,3038,2540,5478,3794,966,2298,286,2520,296,16797,296,553,2428,19397,29879,316,6896,21558,29889,11001,267,1539,29873,296,553,2656,267,316,330,309,634,610,5521,29892,553,3006,1041,316,3949,265,1579,1179,634,2906,23510,443,17912,1821,634,27597,3479,26809,868,21423,5198,348,9407,29889,11948,3440,13942,29877,2496,20554,29892,274,29915,342,2428,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2643,29892,541,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,491,16021,10757,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,773,325,3640,6382,708,304,19310,675,278,17912,573,3081,310,23900,9101,29892,607,17583,378,345,952,278,20953,310,278,2228,29889,2398,29892,777,310,278,16726,1754,297,278,12032,526,451,9186,16232,470,1532,29899,22492,3656,630,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,3229,393,376,348,1559,553,18554,29871,1654,5814,5326,2947,13942,29877,2496,443,23900,29908,313,12676,292,376,650,2022,1244,2198,674,2693,23900,1159,338,385,288,874,13699,2450,310,278,4280,13879,393,29126,304,23900,5849,29889,13,13,29943,332,721,5514,29892,1550,278,25657,12141,29879,278,13500,310,278,5198,1540,1788,297,17770,23900,29892,896,437,451,3867,8002,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,5198,1540,1788,338,451,11828,297,10397,1218,23900,9101,29889,319,901,12912,20657,7418,723,25135,4392,2827,278,9281,5925,322,1284,886,373,278,11261,29892,408,1532,408,13858,916,13879,393,1122,9949,278,2779,20193,310,278,5198,1540,1788,297,17770,23900,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,2821,322,10879,1319,29892,1009,24481,1033,14169,515,901,16424,10757,322,7418,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,322,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":75456767623,"load_duration":331486,"prompt_eval_count":271,"prompt_eval_duration":32542808000,"eval_count":282,"eval_duration":42913036000}
