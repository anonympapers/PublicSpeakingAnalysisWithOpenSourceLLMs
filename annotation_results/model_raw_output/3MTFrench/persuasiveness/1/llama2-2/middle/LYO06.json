{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T23:03:25.758855135Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 (moderately persuasive) for the speech's ability to craft a convincing message. The speaker does provide some relevant examples and asks questions to the audience to engage them, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. Lack of clear arguments: The speaker mentions that they have been observing and investigating the actors involved in implementing these solutions, but the reasons behind their findings are not always clearly articulated. More emphasis should be placed on presenting logical arguments to support the speaker's claims.\n2. Inconsistent tone: At times, the speaker's tone seems to shift between being informative and persuasive, which can make it difficult for the audience to follow their line of reasoning. A more consistent tone throughout the speech would help to create a clearer message.\n3. Lack of evidence: While the speaker provides some examples to illustrate their points, there is a lack of concrete evidence to support their claims. More data and empirical evidence should be presented to bolster the speaker's arguments and increase their persuasiveness.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates some understanding of the topic and engages the audience with questions, more attention should be paid to presenting clear, logical arguments and providing evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,17889,316,611,266,17449,427,5646,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,932,9555,553,17043,790,2925,1190,425,9927,3165,9874,316,7015,6851,29889,341,1004,7561,29881,29892,301,29915,26739,362,634,301,29915,264,339,9061,29889,6803,301,29915,26739,362,29892,1444,28511,1671,1841,13094,553,1044,11620,1750,1539,29873,296,443,29871,19898,7015,6851,1671,8689,966,1444,1314,316,19397,29889,6803,301,29915,264,339,9061,29892,1444,966,1006,307,1173,9411,4348,27751,1671,7015,11382,1575,3479,26971,29889,1459,17488,29892,14034,29920,1597,6815,3814,9221,23249,274,16555,2606,1908,29892,12796,1318,610,4239,784,1475,363,11521,5908,29889,997,289,4070,29892,712,7890,29871,22730,29892,633,681,650,818,27962,316,301,29915,1540,818,301,29915,18288,29889,1105,361,712,18097,7890,18331,29920,782,13222,29892,7890,19643,29920,16731,439,29915,309,302,29915,29891,263,2331,21394,316,904,5547,1671,7890,274,11665,7628,316,26814,13310,1318,29889,11948,7890,29871,22730,19872,1314,29892,1444,454,29758,6079,29889,478,681,7890,301,29915,264,872,275,18097,6701,29889,1174,1791,424,18097,6701,3479,946,1759,29889,8748,7890,8992,29920,6079,18836,29892,1559,21975,454,13222,29892,7890,6454,15325,1190,443,9221,12906,371,332,1750,7890,6309,29889,10016,288,23270,29892,29871,4277,8164,7848,330,5512,749,818,17103,1540,610,4497,4182,29889,11948,980,1702,13871,712,425,14326,1436,749,1671,427,337,9018,357,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,1794,8164,7848,9577,1841,1579,17192,381,29889,9194,280,1875,29892,7890,1671,15749,9364,276,26814,26786,1190,443,17887,1644,29875,1045,11728,2123,7890,867,1690,26477,782,14858,28667,711,29948,29889,751,392,5646,263,17103,29892,7890,29271,346,13325,782,658,262,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,313,1545,261,2486,20408,294,573,29897,363,278,12032,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,8018,6455,322,19514,5155,304,278,20026,304,3033,482,963,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,6273,29901,450,25657,26649,393,896,505,1063,5366,1747,322,7405,1218,278,29701,9701,297,16049,1438,6851,29892,541,278,9590,5742,1009,1284,886,526,451,2337,9436,1616,293,7964,29889,5853,19310,275,881,367,7180,373,2198,292,16667,6273,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,13,29906,29889,512,3200,9696,16225,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,2444,304,9500,1546,1641,1871,1230,322,20408,294,573,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,1101,1009,1196,310,24481,29889,319,901,13747,16225,10106,278,12032,723,1371,304,1653,263,26135,2643,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,727,338,263,10225,310,18387,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5853,848,322,29190,936,10757,881,367,9132,304,15772,2475,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,322,7910,1009,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,9004,1078,777,8004,310,278,11261,322,3033,1179,278,20026,411,5155,29892,901,8570,881,367,12530,304,2198,292,2821,29892,16667,6273,322,13138,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":151330168786,"load_duration":277065,"prompt_eval_count":337,"prompt_eval_duration":36549247000,"eval_count":290,"eval_duration":114780057000}
