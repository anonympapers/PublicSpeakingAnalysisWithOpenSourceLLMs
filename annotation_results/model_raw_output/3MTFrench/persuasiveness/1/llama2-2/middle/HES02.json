{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T15:27:55.228706078Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker seems to be passionate about their topic and uses convincing language to make their points. However, the speech lacks a clear structure and coherent argumentation, which hinders its overall persuasive power. The speaker jumps between different topics without connecting them logically, making it difficult for the listener to follow their line of reasoning.\n\nRigor of Reasoning: The speaker's arguments are not rigorous enough, and they lack supporting evidence or logical reasoning. They make some bold claims, such as the idea that vibrations can be used to create a new form of fuel, but provide no concrete examples or scientific evidence to back them up. Additionally, the speaker's reliance on anecdotal evidence and personal experience undermines their credibility.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some enthusiasm and creativity in their ideas, they need to work on developing a more coherent and persuasive argumentation to effectively convince their audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8861,358,712,454,1841,643,7869,427,599,375,9212,707,4239,343,314,424,3435,16962,375,454,1559,8399,424,274,29915,342,29871,29906,14746,1006,351,5582,634,1735,425,13618,868,1841,643,7869,818,3209,818,966,18893,316,325,26218,29889,1720,1735,5695,966,1424,21871,2063,316,6896,265,749,29892,29871,4277,1539,5646,2257,1750,263,1597,1424,29948,3910,29892,425,1424,29948,3910,5881,423,802,427,8957,882,610,11015,634,3856,19601,1444,14954,1173,818,3408,261,3440,16380,479,454,1841,643,7869,3503,427,8957,882,610,26617,634,1671,29871,4277,1444,13942,29877,4798,316,5900,709,29889,1551,286,29915,29874,6309,12821,5291,364,30037,1960,316,1775,11674,1661,1444,17043,275,966,1775,11674,29892,27128,519,15935,634,1601,3268,2373,11674,18097,1444,610,280,325,26218,29889,2581,926,1004,3999,1302,6847,29892,1444,14954,1173,439,7768,29892,1444,14954,1173,425,1841,1713,782,2752,270,29915,735,7018,29889,951,1559,8399,424,270,29915,1540,2723,345,2085,915,634,12507,280,29892,274,29915,342,425,6434,29892,1444,724,276,325,359,1750,1559,29890,545,18097,373,592,610,280,316,282,7273,362,29892,2123,29875,8164,7848,439,29915,1351,29883,443,14937,29892,1444,3209,344,966,11561,29892,270,3246,29899,23088,712,1444,1209,1572,29875,611,6316,818,9484,261,553,301,27360,316,775,29889,1551,427,1365,347,20737,553,16451,2406,1465,966,8162,29889,2581,302,29915,1794,2331,454,7017,3041,5218,274,29915,342,3408,29892,3503,818,6267,1044,2491,707,603,29920,966,325,4626,800,29871,4277,16067,553,26893,553,16283,992,533,553,3031,13116,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,712,611,260,267,1647,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,2444,304,367,15935,403,1048,1009,11261,322,3913,17953,3277,4086,304,1207,1009,3291,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,263,2821,3829,322,16165,261,296,2980,362,29892,607,298,513,414,967,12463,20408,294,573,3081,29889,450,25657,432,17204,1546,1422,23820,1728,16791,963,1480,1711,29892,3907,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,1009,1196,310,24481,29889,13,13,29934,335,272,310,830,1658,292,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,6273,526,451,12912,20657,3307,29892,322,896,10225,20382,10757,470,16667,24481,29889,2688,1207,777,14288,16726,29892,1316,408,278,2969,393,325,4626,800,508,367,1304,304,1653,263,716,883,310,26413,29892,541,3867,694,18387,6455,470,16021,10757,304,1250,963,701,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,12536,749,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,7271,563,837,1475,1009,6625,4127,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,23644,3173,29885,322,907,28157,297,1009,7014,29892,896,817,304,664,373,14338,263,901,16165,261,296,322,20408,294,573,2980,362,304,17583,7602,1239,1009,20026,29889],"total_duration":74005132523,"load_duration":215203,"prompt_eval_count":325,"prompt_eval_duration":36469558000,"eval_count":257,"eval_duration":37534849000}
