{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T22:11:47.156817739Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker presents a clear and concise argument, but it lacks emotional appeal and storytelling elements that could make the message more compelling to the audience. The speech is more informative than persuasive, as it does not evoke any strong emotions or create a sense of urgency around the issue being addressed.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker presents some logical arguments and examples to support their claim, but they could be more thorough and well-researched. For instance, the comparison between the number of colliers de rythme produced per day and the time it takes to complete a task is an interesting point, but it could be further developed and supported with data or studies to make it more convincing. Additionally, some of the reasoning presented feels intuitive and not fully thought out, such as the suggestion to work slower to compensate for a non-practical vise.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some valid points, their argument could be strengthened by incorporating more persuasive elements and rigorous reasoning to make it more convincing and compelling to the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2123,28185,9373,454,784,4926,316,4239,868,364,1541,1004,610,992,17252,29892,12852,12471,29871,29947,29900,29900,784,27801,316,868,364,1541,1004,610,8694,29889,8748,6079,8532,29892,1354,26814,325,895,1509,302,29915,342,2331,544,15819,29892,610,27951,361,29892,2331,2258,21873,818,3667,7608,29892,1354,4875,302,29915,342,2331,454,27044,882,316,26814,831,19428,29892,7890,8992,29920,4239,6851,29889,997,8861,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,29231,5495,11387,325,568,29889,11948,1465,1597,2637,7734,4191,443,7006,8694,29892,1597,11015,29892,274,29915,342,1597,992,17252,18402,26617,16731,29889,3201,29894,737,944,443,11872,29892,302,29915,342,12866,2331,325,336,2073,1597,2984,29889,997,26617,1650,29889,8748,427,5246,29892,425,25642,29892,274,29915,342,712,7890,4327,26477,26814,2258,15529,316,29231,5495,29889,5462,7890,7744,26477,782,20299,882,316,26814,714,309,29889,11948,5278,13852,29892,443,17103,25323,277,361,29892,1559,5278,10098,29892,274,29915,342,7890,29892,439,29915,309,343,263,966,316,7869,29879,4145,1358,29892,425,2723,457,316,26814,714,309,29889,478,681,4788,29920,316,7869,286,2249,272,7608,553,19313,29892,634,7848,1098,296,361,782,11387,316,1841,29883,647,284,1671,1841,351,381,782,2298,325,568,29892,5646,782,11364,29892,2257,17103,25323,277,361,16794,1249,8323,6042,744,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2980,29892,541,372,425,4684,23023,1848,25530,322,5828,29873,7807,3161,393,1033,1207,278,2643,901,752,7807,304,278,20026,29889,450,12032,338,901,1871,1230,1135,20408,294,573,29892,408,372,947,451,321,5744,738,4549,23023,1080,470,1653,263,4060,310,5065,14703,2820,278,2228,1641,20976,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,22981,777,16667,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,29892,541,896,1033,367,901,17826,322,1532,29899,690,2842,287,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,10230,1546,278,1353,310,784,27801,316,364,1541,1004,7371,639,2462,322,278,931,372,4893,304,4866,263,3414,338,385,8031,1298,29892,541,372,1033,367,4340,8906,322,6969,411,848,470,11898,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,29889,19814,29892,777,310,278,24481,9132,23880,27951,573,322,451,8072,2714,714,29892,1316,408,278,8998,304,664,20312,304,22874,403,363,263,1661,29899,29886,1461,936,325,895,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,29892,1009,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,11039,1218,901,20408,294,573,3161,322,12912,20657,24481,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,322,752,7807,304,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":56396492243,"load_duration":191810,"prompt_eval_count":264,"prompt_eval_duration":22143952000,"eval_count":282,"eval_duration":34251827000}
