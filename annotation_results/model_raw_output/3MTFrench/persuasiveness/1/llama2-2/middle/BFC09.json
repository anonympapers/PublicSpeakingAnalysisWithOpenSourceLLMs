The speaker effectively presents their argument and provides reasons to support their claim that testing all candidates is inconceivable and that a selective approach is necessary. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that they will present another variety of wheat and a smaller number of candidates with different profiles. While this approach may allow for a more comprehensive comparison of the candidates' abilities, it is not entirely clear how this will help in defining a profile that guarantees good performance as a competitor against other herbs.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could have provided more details on what specific characteristics they are looking for in their ideal candidate and why these are important for success in the competition. By providing more context and evidence to support their argument, the speaker could have made their reasoning more rigorous and persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a valid argument for why testing all candidates is not feasible, there are some areas where the reasoning could be improved to make the speech more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,270,29915,24430,29892,454,5419,316,1197,28141,316,772,735,9230,707,6079,9577,4100,29889,1720,707,12866,22629,346,440,519,316,1243,261,301,29915,24031,553,7105,1446,3104,296,28119,29889,1720,2947,12866,11092,417,381,2779,2853,1597,8861,7019,1464,25763,7015,15159,414,29889,405,681,599,787,12866,5814,5893,443,14857,1197,7342,316,1999,29948,29892,443,5419,1791,276,524,316,7105,1446,29892,3503,2535,553,20077,29879,9577,12694,1237,29889,1551,8164,12866,6382,4983,443,7017,544,1893,5818,316,772,4841,29892,4595,29892,367,585,29892,3234,361,29892,29871,4277,592,12563,9577,269,29915,342,302,4664,424,29892,3503,9577,270,29915,404,2747,2535,7006,316,13472,8232,29889,8748,29871,1654,29892,443,1473,29892,2298,521,1893,361,29892,11387,409,3594,29892,2298,696,2151,712,390,1803,4006,29892,3503,22847,5646,316,6701,1597,289,7293,3581,1765,545,868,899,29889,951,1203,361,29871,1654,29892,427,5734,424,454,6896,499,271,16219,29884,610,7814,4239,544,1893,355,1934,29892,634,316,1437,4951,381,443,20077,29889,853,21285,316,1559,23096,1750,27510,277,872,4443,29899,29873,29899,5474,1671,7848,443,10814,25732,568,332,1998,29899,30001,29899,1730,553,325,359,4883,902,5707,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,22981,1009,2980,322,8128,9590,304,2304,1009,5995,393,6724,599,21669,338,22629,346,440,519,322,393,263,1831,573,2948,338,5181,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,674,2198,1790,12875,310,21266,271,322,263,7968,1353,310,21669,411,1422,28723,29889,5806,445,2948,1122,2758,363,263,901,15171,6270,10230,310,278,21669,29915,633,9770,29892,372,338,451,9186,2821,920,445,674,1371,297,16184,263,8722,393,10509,267,1781,4180,408,263,5100,2105,2750,916,902,5824,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,4902,373,825,2702,21862,896,526,3063,363,297,1009,10839,14020,322,2020,1438,526,4100,363,2551,297,278,13888,29889,2648,13138,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1754,1009,24481,901,12912,20657,322,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2854,2980,363,2020,6724,599,21669,338,451,28326,1821,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,16710,304,1207,278,12032,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":64293260502,"load_duration":228929,"prompt_eval_count":242,"prompt_eval_duration":28267411000,"eval_count":245,"eval_duration":36025113000}
