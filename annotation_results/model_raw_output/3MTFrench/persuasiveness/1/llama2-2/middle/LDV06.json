The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning to support their claim that the CF-2 activity is decreased when blocking the pels-cy messages, but there are some areas where the argumentation could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic of pels-cy and their role in cellular activity. This would have helped to establish a clearer understanding of the issue at hand and why it is important to investigate the decrease in CF-2 activity when blocking these messages.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker provides some examples of how the decrease in CF-2 activity affects the poulons, they could have gone into more detail on how this impacts the broader population. This would have helped to demonstrate the wider implications of their findings and why it is important to investigate further.\n\nLastly, the speaker's use of technical terms such as \"numérode\" and \"péramide\" could be clarified for a general audience. While these terms are likely important in the field of cellular biology, they may not be familiar to non-experts and could be confusing. Providing clear explanations or definitions of these terms could help to make the speech more accessible and persuasive to a wider audience.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments, there are areas where the argumentation could be strengthened to make the speech more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,29871,29953,29899,29929,634,29871,29946,29892,301,29915,11236,2131,868,17861,29899,29906,707,3964,8675,29948,29889,997,3765,29899,29880,895,270,29915,3035,29940,29892,7890,3635,2353,29920,316,9073,425,3928,749,29892,29871,29953,409,1841,3666,296,818,1999,327,29892,29871,29929,818,274,482,29892,29871,29946,818,29549,29899,1270,29889,3164,327,29899,29883,482,29549,29899,1270,29889,2664,29549,29899,1270,3435,553,7191,10067,2361,1465,7814,3038,2540,29889,3872,29883,28194,1444,6668,802,966,29549,29899,1270,29892,454,15600,29899,29941,707,11387,5039,29948,29889,438,1481,3503,980,343,263,21394,316,29549,29899,1270,12694,1237,1465,301,29915,6388,6386,634,980,454,18062,13545,1473,267,29889,435,29915,264,7468,274,747,12898,29871,29941,29892,1750,3435,5814,1237,1465,966,282,5059,787,29889,26079,325,10281,966,339,1379,25763,872,13618,29892,425,282,1064,314,680,316,29549,29899,1270,29889,341,1004,29899,29891,29899,29891,29899,280,29892,1444,7890,18332,443,1399,625,29889,997,954,22462,484,707,425,24407,316,425,2967,29889,360,2554,29871,29896,29889,997,954,10651,311,707,6079,22819,1318,29892,3503,452,3435,5644,262,2331,29889,402,2735,29871,29896,29889,8748,425,954,10651,311,29871,29941,8164,8689,2298,658,262,712,14984,966,10890,29889,350,1187,29871,29941,29889,3767,293,371,29899,29890,13533,29899,29920,2749,4983,371,29889,350,481,20864,29899,2749,4983,371,29889,12390,564,29890,465,1379,29871,29953,564,16105,29889,478,681,7890,270,3246,712,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,17861,29899,29906,6354,338,9263,1463,746,23473,278,29549,29899,1270,7191,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,29549,29899,1270,322,1009,6297,297,3038,1070,6354,29889,910,723,505,9213,304,10127,263,26135,8004,310,278,2228,472,1361,322,2020,372,338,4100,304,23033,278,23806,297,17861,29899,29906,6354,746,23473,1438,7191,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,6455,310,920,278,23806,297,17861,29899,29906,6354,6602,29879,278,282,5059,787,29892,896,1033,505,7695,964,901,9493,373,920,445,10879,29879,278,2545,1664,4665,29889,910,723,505,9213,304,22222,278,25734,2411,5795,310,1009,1284,886,322,2020,372,338,4100,304,23033,4340,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,16905,4958,1316,408,376,1949,10651,311,29908,322,376,29886,1064,314,680,29908,1033,367,7542,2164,363,263,2498,20026,29889,5806,1438,4958,526,5517,4100,297,278,1746,310,3038,1070,4768,3002,29892,896,1122,451,367,9985,304,1661,29899,735,546,1372,322,1033,367,16051,29889,9133,4821,2821,7309,800,470,15848,310,1438,4958,1033,1371,304,1207,278,12032,901,15579,322,20408,294,573,304,263,25734,20026,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,304,1207,278,12032,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":153518635890,"load_duration":232326,"prompt_eval_count":292,"prompt_eval_duration":30132566000,"eval_count":333,"eval_duration":123385244000}
