{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T15:26:41.209084027Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker is effectively crafting a convincing message by presenting a logical and well-structured argument. They are using evidence and examples to support their claim that Trox Simulator can help Robert's company solve its economic crisis and reduce migraines.\n\nThe speaker is also using persuasive language and tone, such as \"c'est son des occasions au moins de raler\" (it's his chance at least to catch up) and \"il m'a dit, c'est bien beau Ã§a\" (he told me it's great), which helps to engage the audience and build trust.\n\nHowever, there is one area where the speaker could improve. At one point, they mention that the first version of Trox Simulator ran on an computer with 300 processors, which might be seen as a drawback for some audiences. To address this, the speaker could have provided more details on the current capabilities and limitations of the software, as well as any plans for future upgrades or improvements.\n\nOverall, the speaker is doing a good job in presenting their argument and persuading the audience, but could benefit from some additional information to make the presentation even more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,997,25927,2488,29889,323,29915,279,374,424,29889,951,1203,361,316,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,9073,427,29835,712,4755,26030,316,364,18362,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,1444,3911,7468,9551,29948,8316,29916,3439,9183,29892,443,5900,709,1750,269,29915,29891,592,301,15792,325,26218,1465,425,992,347,285,3127,1318,634,13214,1465,454,6411,579,29889,5791,289,692,29948,316,1487,289,13411,868,4670,6578,5000,29892,4755,8164,9484,261,427,13545,9335,1912,29889,853,1067,265,19419,316,425,992,347,634,1027,8584,966,325,4626,800,1465,5278,992,347,5646,4191,269,29915,309,16623,1249,3999,3686,1759,29889,26383,8316,29916,3439,9183,29892,4755,1671,8356,6701,10628,7869,425,992,347,868,3105,332,1750,872,277,29889,438,1481,29889,6803,4755,29892,274,29915,342,1487,553,26108,782,11387,316,364,18362,29889,6803,1487,14547,29892,2257,3435,316,872,2181,895,23837,1387,29889,8748,553,29542,336,1144,1661,11387,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,18097,454,16474,1249,29871,4277,29892,4755,980,302,29915,14386,712,9577,19966,2108,882,439,29915,265,325,3742,29884,347,29889,1720,286,29915,29874,6309,29892,274,29915,342,6079,367,585,29871,4277,29889,11948,29871,4277,16067,4145,819,316,8714,818,6282,1089,29973,7747,712,19601,432,29915,1794,439,29915,348,282,404,22137,270,29915,442,29892,432,29915,1794,2331,454,2428,3408,7289,316,425,24206,29889,1720,302,29915,23071,2331,1236,332,2257,923,345,1314,4755,29889,1704,425,8861,1873,316,8316,29916,3439,9183,6282,1056,277,1190,443,22420,7289,818,29871,29941,29900,29900,9580,29948,30019,414,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,17583,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,491,2198,292,263,16667,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29889,2688,526,773,10757,322,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,393,8316,29916,3439,9183,508,1371,4755,29915,29879,5001,4505,967,17407,24161,322,10032,29542,336,1475,29889,13,13,1576,25657,338,884,773,20408,294,573,4086,322,16225,29892,1316,408,376,29883,29915,342,1487,553,26108,782,11387,316,364,18362,29908,313,277,29915,29879,670,8825,472,3203,304,4380,701,29897,322,376,309,286,29915,29874,6309,29892,274,29915,342,6079,367,585,29871,4277,29908,313,354,5429,592,372,29915,29879,2107,511,607,6911,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,2048,9311,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,338,697,4038,988,278,25657,1033,11157,29889,2180,697,1298,29892,896,3585,393,278,937,1873,310,8316,29916,3439,9183,6350,373,385,6601,411,29871,29941,29900,29900,1889,943,29892,607,1795,367,3595,408,263,4216,1627,363,777,12990,819,778,29889,1763,3211,445,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,4902,373,278,1857,27108,322,27028,310,278,7047,29892,408,1532,408,738,13900,363,5434,701,629,3076,470,28473,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,338,2599,263,1781,4982,297,2198,292,1009,2980,322,20408,9382,278,20026,29892,541,1033,14169,515,777,5684,2472,304,1207,278,24329,1584,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":76932540272,"load_duration":190271,"prompt_eval_count":314,"prompt_eval_duration":35276408000,"eval_count":292,"eval_duration":41655360000}
