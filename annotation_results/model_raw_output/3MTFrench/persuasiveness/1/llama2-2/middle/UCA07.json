{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T03:34:36.39429899Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and metaphors to make their message more convincing, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker's use of repetition in emphasizing certain points, such as \"I don't know\" and \"which there is no,\" creates a sense of uncertainty and doubt, which can be persuasive in conveying the idea that the speaker is not sure about something. The metaphor of \"a big hole\" to describe the lack of knowledge is also an effective tool in conveying the idea that the speaker is aware of their own limitations.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the argument that \"there is no such thing as a little bit pregnant\" could be strengthened by providing more context or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more logical reasoning to explain why they believe that there is no such thing as a \"diagnolive,\" rather than simply stating that they don't know what it means.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's use of rhetorical devices and self-awareness of their own limitations can be seen as persuasive, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous to make the speech even more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,20935,29112,2721,1538,8573,29892,4228,6408,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,289,790,2724,29892,4281,754,1216,1210,6408,12795,2712,29892,15261,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,606,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4228,22511,30043,490,1046,588,29899,702,8573,432,9940,30045,733,29899,29957,1494,665,665,2237,29959,26348,20603,3805,29887,355,29893,702,29919,665,11011,1198,490,30557,31475,3646,287,665,594,6777,2282,1538,6253,30005,5413,2282,26566,2282,1586,29977,19829,14179,29892,2282,6785,9797,18752,29996,1938,292,1724,319,4671,4211,324,573,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,1539,12451,943,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,21159,654,297,19310,5281,3058,3291,29892,1316,408,376,29902,1016,29915,29873,1073,29908,322,376,4716,727,338,694,1699,10017,263,4060,310,25812,322,7404,29892,607,508,367,20408,294,573,297,378,345,5414,278,2969,393,278,25657,338,451,1854,1048,1554,29889,450,1539,481,2015,310,376,29874,4802,16188,29908,304,8453,278,10225,310,7134,338,884,385,11828,5780,297,378,345,5414,278,2969,393,278,25657,338,9543,310,1009,1914,27028,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,2980,393,376,12711,338,694,1316,2655,408,263,2217,2586,758,5138,424,29908,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,3030,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,16667,24481,304,5649,2020,896,4658,393,727,338,694,1316,2655,408,263,376,6051,4211,324,573,1699,3265,1135,3763,23659,393,896,1016,29915,29873,1073,825,372,2794,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,322,1583,29899,1450,8326,404,310,1009,1914,27028,508,367,3595,408,20408,294,573,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,304,1207,278,12032,1584,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":86059868826,"load_duration":269920,"prompt_eval_count":394,"prompt_eval_duration":41645020000,"eval_count":321,"eval_duration":44414020000}
