{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T23:12:40.825441321Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker provides some interesting statistics about the number of people promoting their city and the potential benefits of attracting foreign entrepreneurs. However, they do not provide any concrete evidence to support these claims, such as data on the economic impact of previous entrepreneurship initiatives or case studies of successful businesses that have been established in the region.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker mentions a \"mod√®le\" that they have created to revolutionize business conservation, they do not provide any details about what this model entails or how it could be implemented effectively. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to assess the feasibility and potential impact of the proposed approach.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in presenting their argument, they could benefit from providing more concrete evidence and details to support their claims and make their message more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,997,29452,316,24145,8441,29889,1551,966,301,1080,16731,2298,316,29871,29906,29953,29871,29900,29900,29900,18554,1750,4079,425,22360,316,301,1080,270,29915,348,9122,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,309,4079,1577,315,29915,342,553,18554,439,29915,265,7890,707,19601,1750,707,427,5246,29892,611,19694,553,7456,1190,966,1841,344,2993,269,10183,1314,29892,11797,4079,6003,381,553,18554,270,29915,26283,9230,1998,29899,30001,29899,20146,24145,8441,29889,1720,16193,3479,23440,4637,23428,574,5908,316,269,29915,326,9018,357,1190,24145,14326,29889,5879,277,1298,29892,980,4079,29871,4277,867,8088,17334,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,432,29915,1794,6309,454,1601,2320,1387,29889,461,274,29915,342,1950,1577,6803,25497,276,818,2257,1134,316,1139,29892,432,29915,1794,4370,6079,17814,29883,542,15566,22781,29889,435,29915,1794,4325,9996,29948,966,25504,4515,270,29915,14056,558,1600,1295,868,28710,29889,435,29915,1794,966,904,1639,1493,12491,29889,435,29915,1794,9484,29948,1597,2967,316,21880,443,6314,424,2298,316,4239,6063,634,23690,270,29915,26739,800,5221,3794,782,13625,316,10741,12286,29889,951,6896,499,271,29892,443,878,15340,1750,1539,425,8220,782,1302,5411,553,17459,800,29889,7747,878,15340,1671,8356,1841,4068,1089,24145,2258,15529,316,378,2974,454,5381,1559,980,14924,316,1437,4713,3709,966,23440,4637,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,8128,777,8031,13964,1048,278,1353,310,2305,2504,11427,1009,4272,322,278,7037,23633,310,13978,292,9117,23440,1600,1295,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,304,2304,1438,16726,29892,1316,408,848,373,278,17407,10879,310,3517,23440,1600,332,3527,14511,5056,470,1206,11898,310,9150,5381,267,393,505,1063,7841,297,278,5120,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,263,376,1545,15340,29908,393,896,505,2825,304,19479,675,5381,24201,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,1048,825,445,1904,875,2234,470,920,372,1033,367,8762,17583,29889,910,10225,310,2702,537,3732,372,5189,304,24809,278,28326,4127,322,7037,10879,310,278,7972,2948,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,2198,292,1009,2980,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18387,10757,322,4902,304,2304,1009,16726,322,1207,1009,2643,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":111337011014,"load_duration":262392,"prompt_eval_count":268,"prompt_eval_duration":28387499000,"eval_count":237,"eval_duration":82948585000}
