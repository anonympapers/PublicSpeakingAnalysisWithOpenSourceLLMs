{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T13:48:44.880020645Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker presents their idea in a clear and concise manner, using simple language and relatable examples. They also provide a compelling reason for their proposal, citing the convenience and cost-effectiveness of using portable devices for detection. However, the speech lacks a strong emotional appeal or personal story that could further engage the audience.\n\nRigor of reasoning: The speaker provides some scientific explanations for their proposal, such as the importance of using antigens and electrodes in the biocapteur Ã©lectrochimique. However, there are some gaps in their reasoning, such as a lack of detail on how the outfit will be used in real-world settings or how it will address potential challenges like interference from other chemicals.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a well-thought-out idea, they could benefit from providing more context and evidence to support their proposal to make it more persuasive and rigorously reasoned.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,838,943,2123,29875,29892,1444,325,1759,2298,3667,7608,553,13698,316,772,6693,29892,14344,712,301,29915,265,5663,6223,1465,966,9775,2361,29892,2123,1465,23563,298,30069,23600,2993,29889,11948,7015,13698,3435,298,3409,381,6394,29892,5172,333,2363,267,29892,634,427,2298,818,454,5054,631,868,24127,818,301,29915,7308,277,2131,29892,18729,452,8556,7602,993,2331,1465,24145,3209,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,19449,1750,409,1841,345,993,325,336,2073,26842,404,424,29892,2257,25810,270,29915,4422,7608,553,714,2719,316,1437,371,428,2011,519,29892,7209,2298,270,29915,4422,4371,29892,7006,14954,634,9577,25182,29892,553,714,2719,712,1444,1671,23469,626,759,1190,454,28439,29892,782,923,345,309,868,16500,29889,8748,18729,263,2535,23422,1597,330,449,371,316,13625,29892,443,7006,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,263,454,330,506,290,30000,2484,1671,454,652,370,19971,29889,2598,15744,707,316,10628,7869,7015,714,2719,29892,16794,1318,4768,542,481,371,332,19507,307,305,326,1387,29892,11797,3435,5541,743,316,4239,13973,29892,443,3677,2101,1004,29892,1035,307,305,1318,1190,1597,19507,307,311,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,28899,412,425,2298,13483,29892,634,2331,553,2298,1027,2701,29892,1559,7209,4875,29892,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,1437,371,312,261,805,4582,6832,339,882,301,29915,24209,371,270,29915,524,1064,11992,29892,29871,1654,29892,301,29915,7716,272,316,425,270,292,434,29889,1174,13495,29892,301,29915,29948,781,307,311,592,14924,316,4327,261,425,25238,9948,29892,2637,301,29915,424,2101,1004,634,301,29915,7716,272,29892,373,263,1804,744,19507,14090,712,1444,1671,23469,2258,455,944,2301,631,261,29889,4241,841,424,29892,1671,3667,7608,1601,714,309,1190,454,28439,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,322,1104,17219,6455,29889,2688,884,3867,263,752,7807,2769,363,1009,24963,29892,7537,292,278,29703,322,3438,29899,15987,20193,310,773,2011,519,9224,363,15326,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,263,4549,23023,1848,25530,470,7333,5828,393,1033,4340,3033,482,278,20026,29889,13,13,29934,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,8128,777,16021,7309,800,363,1009,24963,29892,1316,408,278,13500,310,773,3677,335,575,322,28118,2783,297,278,4768,542,481,371,332,19507,307,305,326,1387,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,330,2547,297,1009,24481,29892,1316,408,263,10225,310,9493,373,920,278,714,9202,674,367,1304,297,1855,29899,11526,6055,470,920,372,674,3211,7037,18066,267,763,1006,1659,515,916,22233,29879,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,386,1774,29899,449,2969,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,24963,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,272,5794,2769,287,29889],"total_duration":119791136427,"load_duration":276625,"prompt_eval_count":349,"prompt_eval_duration":33617671000,"eval_count":253,"eval_duration":86172640000}
