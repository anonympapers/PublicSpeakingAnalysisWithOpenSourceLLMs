{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T06:08:54.585891024Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker is able to effectively craft a convincing message by using emotive language and personal anecdotes to convey their passion and compassion for the topic of deportation. They also use literary analysis as a way to approach the subject, which adds depth and complexity to their argument.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve in terms of rigorous reasoning. For example, they make reference to \"centuries and centuries\" of literature on the subject, but do not provide specific examples or quotes to support their claims. Additionally, they use the term \"déporté\" multiple times without defining it or providing context, which can make it difficult for the listener to fully understand the speaker's argument.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speaker could improve in terms of rigorous reasoning, their passion and conviction shine through clearly throughout the speech, making it a persuasive and impactful delivery.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,302,29915,279,4401,2331,427,260,9030,966,2181,275,29892,966,13159,492,1912,316,7015,1437,637,743,29889,2581,302,29915,1794,875,355,29884,10440,712,454,15142,29889,838,943,29892,1444,592,26099,10733,29948,1224,425,27940,29889,8748,274,29915,342,5695,454,29140,316,611,266,17449,29889,435,29915,1794,27883,553,1644,13116,634,553,1644,13116,270,29915,5128,6617,1190,425,1437,637,362,782,3184,7916,2491,29889,1720,286,29915,29891,1083,545,1249,818,1601,28074,1924,29892,274,29915,342,1437,637,29948,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,452,28078,11818,2331,712,611,19886,3709,1190,301,29915,29882,25892,316,301,29915,2190,29889,435,29915,1794,1104,29884,634,432,29915,1794,1104,29884,7015,6515,29889,435,29915,1794,3643,1354,10440,10440,270,29915,14559,6515,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,11797,3435,18916,29889,435,29915,1794,2654,293,17856,966,301,30000,29894,690,29892,432,29915,1794,2654,293,17856,966,26809,316,7015,1437,637,743,29889,16932,3435,21617,375,4883,1424,5908,29889,9353,1597,904,6468,316,15935,29892,316,752,465,291,29892,712,425,27940,592,14924,4904,29892,1444,966,3686,1759,1572,29875,1465,966,13137,29889,1720,286,29915,609,610,12898,29889,8748,432,29915,9983,1908,19397,7890,9073,760,1875,22572,29915,15669,29892,611,15935,1671,2257,18848,29889,315,29915,342,443,18848,29889,2581,652,23469,270,29915,279,802,5458,15694,29948,6038,29889,1720,16731,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,491,773,23023,573,4086,322,7333,385,687,29881,4769,304,27769,1009,15935,322,752,465,291,363,278,11261,310,21455,362,29889,2688,884,671,22937,7418,408,263,982,304,2948,278,4967,29892,607,12778,10809,322,13644,304,1009,2980,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,297,4958,310,12912,20657,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1207,3407,304,376,1760,14886,322,21726,29908,310,12845,373,278,4967,29892,541,437,451,3867,2702,6455,470,11839,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,19814,29892,896,671,278,1840,376,29881,29948,637,29948,29908,2999,3064,1728,16184,372,470,13138,3030,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,297,4958,310,12912,20657,24481,29892,1009,15935,322,7602,2463,528,457,1549,9436,10106,278,12032,29892,3907,372,263,20408,294,573,322,10879,1319,28289,29889],"total_duration":60207058105,"load_duration":306768,"prompt_eval_count":276,"prompt_eval_duration":29238246000,"eval_count":227,"eval_duration":30967910000}
