The speaker presents some convincing arguments and evidence to support their claims about the geological history of the area they are studying. However, there are some areas where the speaker could improve to make their argument more persuasive and rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could provide more context and background information on the topic to help the audience better understand the significance of their findings. For example, they could explain why the study of geological history is important for understanding the area's ecosystem and how it has evolved over time.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could provide more detail and evidence on the specific fractures they are studying. While they mention that the fractures are \"massive\" and \"fragile,\" they do not provide any information on their size, location, or the specific minerals or rocks they contain. Providing more detailed information on these aspects could help to build a stronger case for why the fractures are important and how they have evolved over time.\n\nFinally, the speaker could consider using more technical language and jargon specific to the field of geology to make their argument more convincing and authoritative. While they mention some technical terms such as \"cartographie g√©ologique\" and \"micro-scope,\" they could benefit from using more detailed terminology to demonstrate their expertise in the field.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling arguments and evidence, there are areas where they could improve to make their speech more persuasive and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,610,3581,5495,553,20052,14228,316,20877,29948,18934,270,29915,28899,30058,1089,1597,20206,270,29915,10651,1173,634,553,285,1461,1973,5814,5326,14255,1601,15935,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,7774,4437,10505,20015,29889,435,29915,1794,5246,712,5291,8648,454,1060,29909,1529,29924,13162,15471,5218,18934,316,1437,18821,261,425,15259,270,29915,10651,1173,712,432,29915,1794,577,647,29948,3479,18664,2993,27254,3503,5695,301,29915,6022,23068,818,553,13917,782,9200,29899,6078,634,553,3483,952,267,20674,3783,269,3021,391,8105,2406,29889,323,681,7015,16285,592,19172,296,8288,316,17789,1981,261,966,29871,29906,14746,270,29915,812,2406,270,29915,13624,316,2257,6316,1314,26535,880,29899,264,29899,295,29892,7019,3075,4080,634,5278,22104,29889,11948,20957,424,782,285,1461,545,610,346,712,966,285,1461,1973,3435,23063,23662,7719,29889,2664,285,1461,1973,3435,553,427,1753,29948,2204,21017,13855,5475,427,301,29915,29948,1555,29883,424,29889,1720,269,29915,342,270,29915,8284,1295,20554,1750,3435,818,301,29915,17234,553,904,8645,3687,634,553,3144,790,4110,316,28439,29889,1720,707,12866,4100,316,4048,6390,1354,7015,285,1461,1973,409,3435,6079,1841,862,2406,6079,5321,296,1775,2406,29889,1174,5246,1661,925,882,610,346,712,1444,26099,10505,1189,434,3829,818,301,29915,342,29889,8748,1750,302,29915,342,3829,818,301,29915,342,553,12286,29892,553,285,1461,1973,29892,634,12866,966,285,1461,1973,2331,286,29915,29874,1841,862,2406,29892,274,29915,342,925,29872,316,1601,831,339,326,26842,404,424,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,1737,5996,4955,310,278,4038,896,526,23382,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,304,1371,278,20026,2253,2274,278,26002,310,1009,1284,886,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,5649,2020,278,6559,310,1737,5996,4955,338,4100,363,8004,278,4038,29915,29879,321,3944,973,322,920,372,756,15220,1490,975,931,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,9493,322,10757,373,278,2702,285,1461,1973,896,526,23382,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,285,1461,1973,526,376,25379,573,29908,322,376,29888,1431,488,1699,896,437,451,3867,738,2472,373,1009,2159,29892,4423,29892,470,278,2702,1375,261,1338,470,23150,896,1712,29889,9133,4821,901,13173,2472,373,1438,21420,1033,1371,304,2048,263,23505,1206,363,2020,278,285,1461,1973,526,4100,322,920,896,505,15220,1490,975,931,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,1033,2050,773,901,16905,4086,322,432,1191,265,2702,304,278,1746,310,1737,3002,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,322,4148,23378,29889,5806,896,3585,777,16905,4958,1316,408,376,13823,4437,10505,20015,29908,322,376,29885,2357,29899,6078,1699,896,1033,14169,515,773,901,13173,6624,3002,304,22222,1009,17924,895,297,278,1746,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,752,7807,6273,322,10757,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,12032,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":161751811119,"load_duration":266196,"prompt_eval_count":313,"prompt_eval_duration":36181146000,"eval_count":352,"eval_duration":125569169000}
