Here's why:\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The speaker is passionate about their topic and conveys that passion through their words.\n2. They provide specific examples and data to support their claims, such as the amount of food waste in France each year.\n3. They acknowledge the complexity of the issue and express a desire to develop methods to address it.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The speaker's delivery is somewhat disjointed and lacking in coherence, with abrupt transitions between ideas.\n2. There is a lack of clear structure or organization to the speech, which can make it difficult to follow at times.\n3. Some of the arguments presented are not fully developed or supported by evidence, such as the claim that the amount of food waste in France each year is \"several dizaines de millions de tonnes.\"\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in presenting their argument, there are areas where they could improve to make their message more convincing and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,818,2970,1671,712,966,11009,331,275,10733,267,8556,2906,787,27227,7608,553,18475,2863,29892,553,394,7862,868,23734,29892,868,282,1893,12154,29892,553,11510,2993,2992,29889,405,681,452,767,305,787,10019,680,29885,358,2331,325,336,2073,14984,7015,18475,2863,29892,3503,8556,966,1136,3011,787,29892,966,4327,787,634,966,1153,8842,521,898,267,29892,5646,4191,439,29915,309,343,263,2002,439,29915,265,1047,1004,29892,4327,29872,634,696,29926,2353,7015,8182,339,21158,29889,6101,1444,2453,1314,4048,6390,2257,712,439,29915,309,343,263,2002,439,29915,265,1047,1004,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,9577,2923,25123,29889,1720,9378,277,316,926,261,7015,8182,339,21158,10042,316,301,29915,3610,29884,381,316,452,29920,29892,634,270,29915,9983,29539,439,29915,1808,452,767,479,21181,270,29915,18288,427,274,496,2353,29889,11948,1671,4048,6390,2257,712,439,29915,265,1047,1004,29892,2123,696,29926,2353,1006,9296,533,29892,425,260,30057,4630,14857,358,2298,4280,29872,29892,634,980,343,263,21394,29892,21394,316,21880,818,364,465,1590,1358,29889,997,5802,9221,23249,29892,301,29915,1062,13857,1375,1908,29892,966,696,29926,5903,5908,301,29915,1466,1224,301,29915,14531,29892,425,16987,427,1437,23367,29892,454,8608,316,8575,392,4637,29892,634,6079,270,29915,18288,29889,5202,327,744,29892,12563,1775,5289,1970,898,434,29892,2257,3435,10741,270,466,13116,316,14746,316,260,24729,1750,18342,296,18402,19951,1190,443,22922,4191,301,29915,2499,29920,834,29889,23719,1039,29892,1601,18848,707,316,13942,29877,2496,966,8774,386,2631,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,5015,1477,29879,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,338,15935,403,1048,1009,11261,322,378,345,952,393,15935,1549,1009,3838,29889,13,29906,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,322,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,278,5253,310,9687,19863,297,3444,1269,1629,29889,13,29941,29889,2688,18145,5485,278,13644,310,278,2228,322,4653,263,13521,304,2693,3519,304,3211,372,29889,13,13,4806,557,2264,267,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,28289,338,10579,766,12090,287,322,10225,292,297,16165,261,663,29892,411,633,6685,1301,2187,1546,7014,29889,13,29906,29889,1670,338,263,10225,310,2821,3829,470,13013,304,278,12032,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,304,1101,472,3064,29889,13,29941,29889,3834,310,278,6273,9132,526,451,8072,8906,470,6969,491,10757,29892,1316,408,278,5995,393,278,5253,310,9687,19863,297,3444,1269,1629,338,376,344,369,284,270,466,13116,316,14746,316,260,24729,1213,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,2198,292,1009,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":61647553080,"load_duration":261776,"prompt_eval_count":317,"prompt_eval_duration":28913946000,"eval_count":264,"eval_duration":32732806000}
