The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more empirical evidence to support their claims. While they mention that their research has shown certain effects of lack of familial support on young mothers, they could have provided more specific data and statistics to back up their argument. This would have made their argument more persuasive and rigorous.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments and criticisms of their position. While they present a clear argument, they do not engage with alternative perspectives or acknowledge potential limitations of their research. By addressing these counterarguments, the speaker could have strengthened their argument and shown that they have considered multiple viewpoints.\n\nFinally, the speaker could have provided more specific recommendations for how to address the issue of lack of familial support for young mothers. While they mention the importance of family support, they do not provide concrete solutions or strategies for how to improve this support. By offering practical recommendations, the speaker could have made their argument more actionable and persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and well-reasoned argument, there are areas where they could improve to make their message more convincing and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,3817,1300,5218,29892,9411,966,18490,316,425,28812,3435,7602,542,2406,29889,997,11449,29892,966,626,275,29892,3503,5695,8648,966,29758,1144,29889,838,943,29892,8556,5820,787,8997,1597,7067,4859,9874,270,29915,812,2406,712,301,29915,5903,1690,882,316,425,405,404,663,707,21617,29884,316,24145,19513,17543,744,443,10019,1690,882,4348,2491,782,18062,337,542,283,552,29889,2664,22114,11825,316,2257,8442,610,2437,11521,452,2453,352,296,2331,316,15470,4595,3847,29892,29202,11797,3435,904,417,647,743,10505,1946,8105,882,316,10713,21038,29889,2664,1153,14125,3435,2473,2701,634,760,275,29899,455,20423,7848,712,966,29026,11825,409,5663,283,794,20536,1671,316,15470,3847,818,274,434,453,381,634,23532,1487,7431,2310,475,316,6267,289,10126,29948,29889,422,1004,1465,1597,266,17449,29892,373,452,8164,2331,5646,9073,29892,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,263,4370,1437,4387,29948,966,1801,1691,868,11482,1300,316,13267,819,1832,616,1190,454,316,15470,21428,29889,1281,4838,882,29892,439,1379,1801,1691,343,29871,22730,29899,2719,1190,966,29026,21428,28194,20554,302,29915,10978,20423,2331,640,29948,1190,966,18490,316,6267,11449,427,316,29882,943,316,6267,378,12090,29892,7628,339,29915,4999,2906,23510,21428,29889,6803,269,29915,264,904,793,1801,1691,29892,1444,592,26099,26842,404,29948,818,301,29915,29948,4068,316,425,1841,29873,2547,3376,1387,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,29892,818,6267,19666,316,1437,2590,634,270,29915,264,5389,7342,782,9587,868,8714,634,8648,818,301,29915,284,29948,4068,316,425,4021,2131,553,5302,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,29190,936,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,896,3585,393,1009,5925,756,4318,3058,9545,310,10225,310,1832,616,2304,373,4123,25550,414,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,2702,848,322,13964,304,1250,701,1009,2980,29889,910,723,505,1754,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,322,11164,12903,310,1009,2602,29889,5806,896,2198,263,2821,2980,29892,896,437,451,3033,482,411,8671,3736,1103,3145,470,18145,5485,7037,27028,310,1009,5925,29889,2648,3211,292,1438,6795,25699,29892,278,25657,1033,505,9324,6419,1009,2980,322,4318,393,896,505,5545,2999,1776,9748,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6907,800,363,920,304,3211,278,2228,310,10225,310,1832,616,2304,363,4123,25550,414,29889,5806,896,3585,278,13500,310,3942,2304,29892,896,437,451,3867,18387,6851,470,16650,583,363,920,304,11157,445,2304,29889,2648,27032,15031,6907,800,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1754,1009,2980,901,3158,519,322,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,23147,287,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":86826408179,"load_duration":290115,"prompt_eval_count":319,"prompt_eval_duration":37231098000,"eval_count":315,"eval_duration":49594411000}
