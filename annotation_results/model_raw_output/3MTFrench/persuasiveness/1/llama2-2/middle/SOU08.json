The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, using logical connections between ideas to build their case. They provide evidence from their own research, including the use of different methods to date the objects found in the grottos, and explain the limitations of these methods. The speaker also acknowledges potential limitations of their own method, the SR, but presents it as a valuable tool for dating objects that are too old for other methods to be effective.\n\nThe only improvement I could suggest is to provide more detailed explanations of the mathematical concepts used to convert the energy in the donnes into ages. While the speaker does mention \"bons outils math√©matiques,\" it would be helpful to provide more context and explanation of these tools to make the argument more convincing.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a well-reasoned and persuasive argument, and with some additional explanations of mathematical concepts, the score could be even higher.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,6079,1465,7015,4071,2167,29892,373,16391,553,7446,29890,4999,16962,424,966,1437,305,1691,316,1634,294,316,7814,10359,30037,5888,29889,8748,427,980,12584,453,424,29892,432,29915,1794,544,309,12491,553,1016,4515,12642,4999,1671,966,274,3222,267,7242,9387,634,553,1373,29890,787,316,23734,1671,966,274,3222,267,1841,1760,267,29889,1174,425,2594,20141,29892,1444,8182,4637,4239,8774,386,2631,316,270,29915,1131,800,29889,365,29915,1540,270,29915,4999,707,454,1559,15933,29899,29883,493,852,29892,1750,14924,316,2635,966,1373,29890,787,316,23734,29892,3503,22700,743,1671,2635,966,1016,4515,12642,4999,7242,9387,29892,9301,29892,1559,5278,8774,386,356,452,8164,2331,16454,782,29899,6144,30001,316,29871,29945,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,6063,29889,838,943,712,9073,1577,8748,6079,274,29915,342,18916,712,24145,8774,386,356,29892,454,21020,2637,427,20244,29892,4875,8164,2635,553,5446,1691,29871,29906,29900,10098,2298,6316,1314,712,2257,712,14924,454,1559,15933,29899,29883,493,852,29889,2581,286,29915,4548,9854,443,7006,2298,29889,317,681,966,2258,1169,316,425,7155,11236,2131,5469,19091,22847,1465,7015,4071,2167,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,2947,7848,2930,2445,1318,1465,966,611,30085,2783,875,7147,316,7015,1016,4515,29889,8748,373,301,29915,29874,289,473,20141,2535,454,21020,29892,373,8164,904,433,1437,371,312,261,634,425,29188,347,29889,15113,301,29915,711,4026,707,26128,29892,2298,980,343,263,553,302,15064,583,29889,8748,427,22700,424,966,289,787,714,2719,5844,2249,19669,29892,1444,1236,1314,3588,381,7015,904,1089,29887,583,427,19406,479,29889,8748,29202,980,8556,21668,29892,1354,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,773,16667,12368,1546,7014,304,2048,1009,1206,29889,2688,3867,10757,515,1009,1914,5925,29892,3704,278,671,310,1422,3519,304,2635,278,3618,1476,297,278,4071,698,359,29892,322,5649,278,27028,310,1438,3519,29889,450,25657,884,24084,2710,7037,27028,310,1009,1914,1158,29892,278,21020,29892,541,22981,372,408,263,21114,5780,363,270,1218,3618,393,526,2086,2030,363,916,3519,304,367,11828,29889,13,13,1576,871,20414,306,1033,4368,338,304,3867,901,13173,7309,800,310,278,19475,22001,1304,304,3588,278,5864,297,278,1016,4515,964,24646,29889,5806,278,25657,947,3585,376,29890,787,714,2719,5844,2249,19669,1699,372,723,367,8444,304,3867,901,3030,322,8252,310,1438,8492,304,1207,278,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,23147,287,322,20408,294,573,2980,29892,322,411,777,5684,7309,800,310,19475,22001,29892,278,8158,1033,367,1584,6133,29889],"total_duration":55555557802,"load_duration":181193,"prompt_eval_count":331,"prompt_eval_duration":28232493000,"eval_count":225,"eval_duration":27322372000}
