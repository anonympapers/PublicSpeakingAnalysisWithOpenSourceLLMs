{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T11:17:31.668485553Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. The speaker seems to be making an argument about the impact of climate change on biodiversity, but the presentation could be improved in several areas:\n\n1. Clarity: At times, the speaker's message is unclear or hard to follow due to the use of technical terms or complex ideas without proper explanation. For example, the phrase \"biodiversité façaut changement climatique\" is not fully understood without further context.\n2. Evidence: While the speaker mentions some examples of how biodiversity responds to climate change, there is a lack of concrete evidence or scientific research to support their claims. Providing more specific data or studies on the topic could help strengthen the argument.\n3. Organization: The speech jumps around in terms of topic and idea, making it difficult to follow the speaker's train of thought. A clearer structure or introduction could help guide the audience through the argument.\n4. Emotional Appeal: The speaker could benefit from incorporating more emotional appeals or storytelling elements to make the message more compelling and memorable for the audience.\n\nOverall, while there are some valid points made about the impact of climate change on biodiversity, the speech could be strengthened by improving clarity, providing more evidence, organizing the content better, and incorporating emotional appeals.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,897,301,29915,21871,7289,1224,966,7446,778,29892,432,29915,1794,6079,7199,275,29892,274,29915,342,454,10784,15819,8474,13386,634,269,29915,309,5246,14671,698,434,4595,277,29889,11948,1671,439,29915,309,343,263,443,274,2487,12154,29892,1444,7890,610,280,316,29871,4277,22572,29915,15669,1577,2581,7890,610,280,316,10784,271,29892,3503,26154,316,5694,19113,29892,7890,4078,29920,8164,29899,5474,712,454,10784,271,1735,634,712,966,8714,3435,1411,712,5246,425,289,2660,1536,2131,2258,30019,1300,1874,882,10784,15819,634,6079,29871,4277,1437,14081,1249,3999,5152,17893,29202,274,29915,342,8541,15819,29889,10016,1139,1671,10503,440,276,3440,534,8885,868,285,1007,1577,3872,29883,29892,16380,479,427,874,454,6218,29892,29871,4277,16933,11387,10329,566,18916,29899,6500,29889,8748,1354,425,8861,553,25179,787,267,1735,29920,316,2058,29892,425,289,2660,1536,2131,25497,29879,427,1735,424,1465,301,29915,267,3535,29892,3503,3440,1444,16623,1577,6101,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,289,692,261,29892,5291,302,29915,294,439,29915,30001,1437,1052,29948,1597,11062,18108,270,29915,11236,2131,29892,425,1766,14817,29892,610,17488,29892,16623,29899,29879,267,21038,28185,9373,29892,454,724,22825,521,5793,1925,538,1465,301,29915,328,29885,1924,1671,3060,2496,553,286,1297,2993,29889,8748,274,29915,342,425,18768,553,25179,787,267,782,1841,1173,29888,882,29889,997,289,2660,1536,2131,25497,29879,427,1735,424,1465,454,8714,29889,2581,1236,1314,6079,2970,454,16053,479,29899,29887,3890,29892,3503,2970,443,534,1682,1750,286,29915,29926,29915,29874,603,29892,611,18108,270,29915,11236,2131,29892,946,5705,1318,316,425,289,2660,1536,2131,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,2444,304,367,3907,385,2980,1048,278,10879,310,23622,1735,373,289,2660,24974,29892,541,278,24329,1033,367,16710,297,3196,10161,29901,13,13,29896,29889,15183,537,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,20871,470,2898,304,1101,2861,304,278,671,310,16905,4958,470,4280,7014,1728,1571,8252,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,16549,376,29890,2660,1536,2131,2258,30019,1300,1874,882,10784,15819,29908,338,451,8072,11098,1728,4340,3030,29889,13,29906,29889,7298,5084,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,777,6455,310,920,289,2660,24974,10049,29879,304,23622,1735,29892,727,338,263,10225,310,18387,10757,470,16021,5925,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,9133,4821,901,2702,848,470,11898,373,278,11261,1033,1371,9324,264,278,2980,29889,13,29941,29889,9205,2133,29901,450,12032,432,17204,2820,297,4958,310,11261,322,2969,29892,3907,372,5189,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,29889,319,26135,3829,470,18707,1033,1371,10754,278,20026,1549,278,2980,29889,13,29946,29889,2812,327,1848,2401,29872,284,29901,450,25657,1033,14169,515,11039,1218,901,23023,1848,5929,1338,470,5828,29873,7807,3161,304,1207,278,2643,901,752,7807,322,26959,519,363,278,20026,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,2854,3291,1754,1048,278,10879,310,23622,1735,373,289,2660,24974,29892,278,12032,1033,367,9324,6419,491,4857,1747,7542,537,29892,13138,901,10757,29892,2894,5281,278,2793,2253,29892,322,11039,1218,23023,1848,5929,1338,29889],"total_duration":67759068283,"load_duration":200533,"prompt_eval_count":330,"prompt_eval_duration":28287467000,"eval_count":319,"eval_duration":39470903000}
