{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T20:55:30.711223682Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 on the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively presents their argument and uses convincing language to make their case for transforming the educational system. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of presenting their thesis and explaining why it is important to transform the educational system. They provide examples of innovative practices being used in some institutions and highlight the limitations of relying on isolated initiatives. The speaker also shows enthusiasm and commitment to their cause, which can be persuasive to the audience.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a general statement that \"il n'y a pas de construction identitaire possible sur n'a même pas les enseignants à échanger et à travailler collectivement.\" While this may be true in some cases, it is not clear how this would work in practice or what specific steps could be taken to facilitate collaboration among teachers.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support their claims. While they provide some examples of innovative practices, there is no concrete data or research to demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches or how they could be scaled up to transform the entire educational system.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a convincing argument for transforming the educational system, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1551,2947,13942,29877,2496,553,282,2487,13247,347,1044,3145,29892,13545,868,18848,427,4464,15744,29892,1671,19172,276,818,301,29915,1893,566,12361,316,13942,29877,2496,553,752,29948,841,778,14333,1041,1465,454,9122,6351,9139,29889,1720,343,263,553,26943,818,23563,2245,29879,316,2600,29879,7602,475,8668,1750,1518,1064,2073,296,553,544,19669,24233,3794,29889,11948,707,29899,346,712,18729,9378,277,818,4327,261,454,21423,1577,315,13946,882,2331,29892,5646,1437,7241,29948,29892,12866,316,27962,316,13545,14511,5056,11695,2406,29892,818,1597,1841,295,4327,1318,1190,20364,553,544,19669,1465,301,29915,2611,5008,29889,8748,4191,432,29915,29874,603,553,11482,275,29892,274,29915,342,454,29140,316,611,266,17449,29889,11948,3440,27516,443,23930,647,424,1750,301,29915,10978,966,286,30037,4467,6515,316,2245,29879,316,2298,29871,29906,29900,6063,270,29915,370,9214,1089,553,4760,8192,553,6745,1475,29889,6803,19601,29892,1487,425,7632,868,302,9095,2893,2131,316,301,29915,8463,264,23520,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,316,13852,1950,29889,1720,302,29915,29891,263,2331,316,7632,2893,9407,1950,1190,302,29915,29874,6701,2331,966,23930,647,1934,818,21206,4600,634,818,29231,5495,6314,19882,29889,438,1481,29892,427,5246,29892,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,8463,2108,882,29892,980,260,29915,262,11236,2131,9577,899,9407,29889,838,943,29892,3440,269,29915,29891,23532,1577,2598,13752,17449,29892,634,439,29915,309,21668,1539,2484,966,18554,427,1970,8837,29892,1671,439,29915,1808,409,29564,439,29915,30001,2331,29892,316,13625,818,330,29539,1465,3999,6314,10270,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,22981,1009,2980,322,3913,17953,3277,4086,304,1207,1009,1206,363,4327,292,278,28976,1788,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,266,6656,322,24232,2020,372,338,4100,304,4327,278,28976,1788,29889,2688,3867,6455,310,24233,1230,23274,1641,1304,297,777,21561,322,12141,278,27028,310,337,5890,373,23968,14511,5056,29889,450,25657,884,3697,23644,3173,29885,322,9063,358,304,1009,4556,29892,607,508,367,20408,294,573,304,278,20026,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,2498,3229,393,376,309,302,29915,29891,263,2331,316,7632,2893,9407,1950,1190,302,29915,29874,6701,2331,966,23930,647,1934,818,21206,4600,634,818,29231,5495,6314,19882,1213,5806,445,1122,367,1565,297,777,4251,29892,372,338,451,2821,920,445,723,664,297,6944,470,825,2702,6576,1033,367,4586,304,16089,10388,24771,4249,27335,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,14169,515,901,2702,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,896,3867,777,6455,310,24233,1230,23274,29892,727,338,694,18387,848,470,5925,304,22222,278,2779,20193,310,1438,13501,470,920,896,1033,367,6287,29881,701,304,4327,278,4152,28976,1788,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,17953,3277,2980,363,4327,292,278,28976,1788,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":68670948493,"load_duration":268723,"prompt_eval_count":321,"prompt_eval_duration":27072246000,"eval_count":337,"eval_duration":41597855000}
