{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T00:16:57.598174725Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions to engage the audience and creates a sense of curiosity around their research topic. However, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: While the speaker raises interesting questions about the impact of distance on group dynamics, they do not provide any empirical evidence to support their claims. Providing specific examples or studies from the literature could help to build a stronger argument.\n2. Vagueness: Some of the language used in the transcript is vague or open-ended, which can make it difficult for the audience to fully understand the speaker's message. For example, the phrase \"le langage corporel\" could be more specific and defined.\n3. Lack of logical structure: The speaker jumps between different topics (e.g., the impact of distance on group dynamics, the use of technology in communication) without providing a clear logical framework for their argument. This can make it difficult for the audience to follow the speaker's train of thought.\n4. Unclear conclusion: The speaker does not provide a clear conclusion or recommendation based on their research findings. This makes it difficult for the audience to understand the speaker's overall message and purpose.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some creativity in their argumentation, there are areas where they could improve the persuasiveness and rigor of their argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,11948,5278,29845,818,5418,634,16530,5289,29892,1444,29758,1601,11107,818,6630,16589,23068,818,425,3949,6947,29889,1394,29892,7890,4078,29920,5646,2257,712,1465,425,12084,29892,21394,553,521,15806,1209,296,610,454,4880,29892,425,1400,545,29889,5334,17103,29892,980,592,21668,427,20255,1190,2058,1750,2947,286,29915,29874,1241,818,2117,357,12563,301,29915,29948,1217,1947,868,6361,482,17266,295,29892,439,29915,265,2947,18158,16455,643,21285,29889,360,29915,348,316,611,266,17449,29892,1444,286,29915,1639,307,479,29889,461,301,29915,6897,663,4824,1387,1465,454,11643,1189,434,6602,29872,966,1889,375,2318,2993,29973,461,8164,29899,265,4327,261,301,29915,735,7018,439,29915,265,29585,301,29915,348,1410,895,868,11107,818,13310,443,24618,661,29973,2664,21426,6896,19718,8556,18443,296,818,2145,2853,29889,951,5246,316,409,1841,348,381,21285,29892,704,27084,966,27138,1147,5521,275,743,29889,1720,452,8164,2331,1791,261,818,269,29915,29891,427,15142,19398,425,3949,6947,29889,1459,263,26231,29892,373,409,7697,29884,16731,712,425,610,1772,868,15087,649,29872,263,21394,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,10017,263,4060,310,27742,2820,1009,5925,11261,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,1153,4637,8031,5155,1048,278,10879,310,5418,373,2318,19753,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,9133,4821,2702,6455,470,11898,515,278,12845,1033,1371,304,2048,263,23505,2980,29889,13,29906,29889,478,351,3837,404,29901,3834,310,278,4086,1304,297,278,1301,924,338,25160,470,1722,29899,2760,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,16549,376,280,6361,482,17266,295,29908,1033,367,901,2702,322,3342,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,16667,3829,29901,450,25657,432,17204,1546,1422,23820,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,278,10879,310,5418,373,2318,19753,29892,278,671,310,15483,297,12084,29897,1728,13138,263,2821,16667,6890,363,1009,2980,29889,910,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,29889,13,29946,29889,853,8551,15997,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,15997,470,29303,2729,373,1009,5925,1284,886,29889,910,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,12463,2643,322,6437,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,907,28157,297,1009,2980,362,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,278,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,1009,2980,29889],"total_duration":57918510329,"load_duration":181266,"prompt_eval_count":222,"prompt_eval_duration":18518072000,"eval_count":325,"eval_duration":39399722000}
