{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T11:12:49.341097934Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument for their proposal to cultivate liver cells in a more controlled environment. They use vivid imagery and metaphors to help the audience visualize the proposed design, making it easier to understand and appreciate the potential benefits of the project.\n\nThe speaker also demonstrates a good understanding of the liver cells' biology and behavior, using terms like \"eponge garg√©e de sang\" and \"circulation sanguine\" to describe their natural habitat. This shows that they have done thorough research on the topic and are knowledgeable about the subject matter.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the argument could be strengthened. For example, the speaker could provide more specific examples of how the proposed design would address the challenges of cultivating liver cells in vitro. Additionally, they could provide more detail on how they plan to validate the effectiveness of their design through experimentation or other means.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a well-crafted and persuasive argument for their proposal, but there is room for further development and validation of their ideas.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1671,4185,2147,7015,3038,2540,868,1701,347,1465,553,5855,2298,410,6609,316,3038,267,316,14913,29899,29885,2708,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,373,1671,8356,2970,712,1444,26099,427,21907,29835,1597,6956,29872,270,29915,524,14508,1750,14954,1173,818,1035,434,453,381,7015,3038,2540,1465,443,13164,1480,882,297,13901,307,1750,6267,7602,993,316,1841,29885,434,1314,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,1444,19760,17043,13639,10713,3503,787,270,29915,17234,29889,1720,269,23071,7890,818,439,7768,18475,6967,454,26814,1701,347,1597,904,1112,479,330,1191,1318,316,13625,29889,438,1481,29892,274,29915,342,443,15744,297,370,1981,295,1671,443,6956,29872,29892,3503,1444,1104,15792,454,1437,7241,29889,4785,1654,1601,15744,29889,2581,610,29879,868,1480,882,316,2967,29892,22700,743,8997,13545,8595,20737,29892,425,2653,346,29889,10043,270,29915,6574,575,339,1379,2653,346,29892,425,2653,346,29892,9200,29899,29888,333,1387,29889,1174,4047,293,650,1301,862,2016,29892,2331,14954,29892,7101,4760,519,29892,29871,29896,29892,29945,7477,1559,5606,29892,782,29899,29873,487,5898,2174,29888,898,29892,29871,29900,29892,29906,5654,29889,5791,1298,29899,3921,29892,3041,29884,680,425,29370,1671,527,1524,425,18342,362,269,2375,457,29889,478,993,18158,611,11943,1173,15001,1808,29889,2581,592,3165,569,301,29915,524,14508,316,5278,2653,346,270,29915,348,14783,468,295,270,29915,2499,5359,403,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,363,1009,24963,304,18834,403,619,369,9101,297,263,901,20704,5177,29889,2688,671,325,3640,6382,708,322,1539,12451,943,304,1371,278,20026,7604,675,278,7972,2874,29892,3907,372,6775,304,2274,322,11188,278,7037,23633,310,278,2060,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,9004,1078,263,1781,8004,310,278,619,369,9101,29915,4768,3002,322,6030,29892,773,4958,763,376,1022,265,479,330,1191,1318,316,13625,29908,322,376,19052,1810,362,269,2375,457,29908,304,8453,1009,5613,17570,29889,910,3697,393,896,505,2309,17826,5925,373,278,11261,322,526,7134,519,1048,278,4967,4383,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,263,2846,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,2702,6455,310,920,278,7972,2874,723,3211,278,18066,267,310,18834,1218,619,369,9101,297,13901,307,29889,19814,29892,896,1033,3867,901,9493,373,920,896,3814,304,12725,278,2779,20193,310,1009,2874,1549,7639,362,470,916,2794,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,17293,287,322,20408,294,573,2980,363,1009,24963,29892,541,727,338,5716,363,4340,5849,322,8845,310,1009,7014,29889],"total_duration":58193060978,"load_duration":286047,"prompt_eval_count":279,"prompt_eval_duration":23664595000,"eval_count":267,"eval_duration":34527607000}
