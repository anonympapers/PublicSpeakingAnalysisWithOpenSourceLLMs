The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning to support their message, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that the speaker acknowledges the limitations of current ventilation practices and recognizes the need for innovation. They also provide a clear and specific example of how their proposed solution could improve ventilation, which helps to build credibility. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported. For example, the speaker's argument that the current lack of tools to measure ventilation efficiency means that \"nous permet aujourd'hui de juger de nos déficicités\" (i.e., we don't know how inefficient our ventilation is today) could be more robustly supported with data or studies. Additionally, the speaker's claim that their proposed solution will provide \"un guide intelligent pour nous aider à mieux venteiler\" (i.e., an intelligent guide to help us ventilate better) could benefit from more detail on how this guide will work and how it will improve ventilation practices.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments and reasoning, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported to fully persuade the audience of the need for innovation in ventilation practices.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,5516,1912,29892,782,301,29915,932,441,316,301,29915,2251,4790,8146,29892,7890,8992,29920,20737,18679,316,5122,2535,3999,752,2708,29892,9073,29871,4277,818,425,13745,29889,1720,21668,9577,6079,904,794,3955,7015,4439,3076,274,29915,342,4100,29892,610,346,712,1354,373,301,29915,932,10069,2331,316,301,29915,2251,4790,8146,29892,980,452,21668,2331,7848,1841,11576,29948,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,18097,373,325,2016,980,263,4439,1943,29892,373,872,277,2331,2257,439,29915,265,5246,29889,1551,452,27905,2331,270,29915,449,2719,1671,1601,1056,347,27386,276,5278,9712,8634,29899,27048,29892,1671,8740,261,316,301,29915,29872,2416,562,2131,316,5278,9712,8634,29892,373,452,872,277,2331,439,29915,1808,7977,29892,373,427,1365,347,782,4439,1943,1465,966,8280,5547,868,4439,1943,29892,634,373,452,872,277,2331,1354,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,553,285,22730,2637,868,5516,802,29889,390,819,29892,8556,14924,22572,29915,15669,316,8740,261,316,7814,1437,9639,293,7719,316,5278,9712,8634,29889,3872,29883,432,29915,1794,1841,1579,29948,4161,29889,2581,592,26099,818,9073,29892,1444,592,26099,3984,7907,454,934,29873,1841,1579,29948,4161,29889,435,29915,1794,1841,1579,29948,4161,1472,27761,29889,8748,2637,4239,274,2142,743,29892,1444,592,26099,6309,29892,980,21668,18097,6701,11817,261,21907,12784,1671,8556,263,1241,818,6628,1314,325,2016,3955,29889,8748,274,29915,342,4191,29871,4277,29892,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,1601,18848,316,260,5793,29889,3872,29883,2535,553,7877,30000,1960,2348,1690,8894,634,7847,7907,2535,553,2348,1690,8894,4768,290,7486,2993,29892,8556,1029,787,378,24359,634,16797,29948,443,11549,277,361,13052,296,29892,1750,8556,10754,1465,5278,9712,8634,29899,27048,29892,1750,8556,6309,818,7594,3256,980,21668,325,2016,3955,29892,7594,7977,980,21668,1663,29884,561,1358,1465,966,8280,5547,868,1209,29948,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,304,2304,1009,2643,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,24084,2710,278,27028,310,1857,9712,8634,23274,322,5936,7093,278,817,363,24233,362,29889,2688,884,3867,263,2821,322,2702,1342,310,920,1009,7972,1650,1033,11157,9712,8634,29892,607,6911,304,2048,6625,4127,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,1857,10225,310,8492,304,5645,9712,8634,19201,2794,393,376,29876,681,14924,22572,29915,15669,316,8740,261,316,7814,1437,9639,293,7719,29908,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,591,1016,29915,29873,1073,920,297,8462,1749,9712,8634,338,9826,29897,1033,367,901,16424,368,6969,411,848,470,11898,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,1009,7972,1650,674,3867,376,348,10754,13052,296,1671,8556,263,1241,818,6628,1314,325,2016,3955,29908,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,385,13052,296,10754,304,1371,502,9712,309,403,2253,29897,1033,14169,515,901,9493,373,920,445,10754,674,664,322,920,372,674,11157,9712,8634,23274,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,304,8072,20408,1943,278,20026,310,278,817,363,24233,362,297,9712,8634,23274,29889],"total_duration":91782551300,"load_duration":302850,"prompt_eval_count":376,"prompt_eval_duration":43663743000,"eval_count":320,"eval_duration":48117765000}
