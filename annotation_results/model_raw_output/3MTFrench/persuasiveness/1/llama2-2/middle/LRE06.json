The speaker does present some convincing arguments and evidence to support their claim about the potential of using organic waste to produce energy. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message more compelling.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more specific examples of the types of organic waste that can be used for energy production, and how these waste streams can be collected and processed. While they mention \"de ce ton, des celles et du gaz,\" it would be helpful to provide more details on what these terms mean and how they are converted into energy.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have addressed potential objections or concerns that listeners may have about using organic waste for energy production. For example, they could have discussed the potential environmental impacts of large-scale food waste collection and processing, or the economic feasibility of implementing such a system on a wide scale.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some persuasive arguments, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message more compelling in order to fully convince the audience of the potential of using organic waste for energy production.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,2257,15243,29892,553,3038,267,634,868,12642,29892,2535,27612,8556,24684,787,1391,533,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,4785,309,30001,29892,3440,432,29915,1794,2889,265,16100,1601,29140,818,4883,610,6544,29889,9353,7814,7446,29890,4999,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,7890,2257,712,301,29915,265,1671,8356,286,29915,1893,273,7608,29889,8748,6079,29892,2257,3435,9411,966,1437,305,1691,2894,3783,29892,2535,966,1791,1446,20196,7147,29892,2123,10440,966,7774,787,3669,453,743,1750,452,20423,2298,7848,1162,29891,695,743,29889,6803,12584,270,29915,1540,1178,1318,29892,16573,316,425,2730,26665,316,7814,7446,29890,4999,29892,1671,7848,1539,841,29884,29871,1654,29892,26842,404,424,302,29915,342,2331,3022,29878,23855,882,29889,2581,6427,8284,1190,553,1518,1064,2073,800,1671,7890,2970,29892,4145,819,316,8774,386,2631,8556,24684,787,1391,533,2535,13547,2123,13547,1437,305,1691,29889,1174,13495,29892,432,29915,20640,895,5278,5802,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,16623,29231,5495,4883,5703,743,818,425,10329,28123,29892,13547,878,15340,316,13618,29889,379,11279,368,29873,293,707,454,7017,818,29231,5495,29889,1174,13495,29892,6079,29892,818,269,29915,29891,270,29915,29877,30071,432,29915,29874,603,29892,7847,818,15093,288,29926,8146,634,427,4951,29892,1539,941,30058,276,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,1048,278,7037,310,773,2894,293,19863,304,7738,5864,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2643,901,752,7807,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,310,278,4072,310,2894,293,19863,393,508,367,1304,363,5864,5802,29892,322,920,1438,19863,20873,508,367,16531,322,19356,29889,5806,896,3585,376,311,2257,15243,29892,553,3038,267,634,868,12642,1699,372,723,367,8444,304,3867,901,4902,373,825,1438,4958,2099,322,920,896,526,11543,964,5864,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,704,24247,470,21838,393,11621,414,1122,505,1048,773,2894,293,19863,363,5864,5802,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,15648,278,7037,29380,10879,29879,310,2919,29899,7052,9687,19863,4333,322,9068,29892,470,278,17407,28326,4127,310,16049,1316,263,1788,373,263,9377,6287,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,20408,294,573,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2643,901,752,7807,297,1797,304,8072,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,7037,310,773,2894,293,19863,363,5864,5802,29889],"total_duration":124876352434,"load_duration":279876,"prompt_eval_count":258,"prompt_eval_duration":26507477000,"eval_count":270,"eval_duration":98367951000}
