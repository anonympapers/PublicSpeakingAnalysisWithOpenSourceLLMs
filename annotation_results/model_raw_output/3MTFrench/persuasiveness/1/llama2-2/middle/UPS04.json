{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T19:06:00.511770323Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker presents their argument in a clear and structured manner, providing technical details about the simulation they are working on to build an immune system for autonomous vehicles. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes claims about the effectiveness of the immune system they are building, but provides no evidence or references to support these claims. This makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of their statements.\n2. Overconfidence: The speaker seems overly confident in the abilities of their immune system, stating that it can detect new attacks and adapt to new threats without providing any supporting data or research.\n3. Lack of context: The speaker does not provide any context for why an immune system is necessary for autonomous vehicles, other than mentioning that there are two types of immune systems in the body. This makes it difficult to understand the relevance of their argument.\n4. Vagueness: Some of the terms used in the transcript are vague or poorly defined, such as \"intelligence artificielle\" and \"charage\". This lack of clarity can make it difficult to follow the speaker's train of thought.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their argument in a clear and organized manner, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,818,872,1082,585,316,11482,9030,29889,10016,992,17252,3119,14785,10741,1203,267,29892,22420,14075,29892,19507,1617,3783,634,5695,553,2117,371,1295,29892,1750,325,609,3911,19172,276,316,7604,7608,29892,16455,643,634,23532,427,4224,2459,29889,4546,29875,29892,1601,18848,1136,2488,818,1539,2484,427,2058,553,3093,3751,4467,634,553,878,30000,793,5844,2249,19669,29892,1671,6787,533,1597,21082,19069,11381,1750,2947,1027,8584,454,21423,5198,348,9407,270,29915,1540,992,17252,1120,265,608,29889,422,1004,24145,21423,5198,348,9407,29892,1487,17889,634,316,11482,9030,1487,2894,6386,8474,12563,12033,1230,270,29915,348,534,743,291,4439,345,453,1647,29889,9353,301,29915,275,277,314,1974,9407,29892,373,263,4239,4072,29889,10016,270,568,297,1318,1750,1841,351,3055,277,25595,358,3503,297,5030,519,316,9073,3700,818,553,9221,5340,1295,13164,29889,10016,270,568,10695,895,2123,9332,1230,29892,1559,4875,707,15390,270,29915,932,29878,9030,818,17043,13639,6628,1314,7209,427,15344,275,29889,4546,29875,29892,1601,21082,19069,709,29892,4875,269,29915,262,1028,533,868,18768,1134,29892,1559,1601,26842,11992,29892,634,712,316,1437,371,312,261,553,26957,472,941,1912,634,316,10984,2993,1147,375,29889,6803,9073,3700,818,425,1373,29876,482,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,2281,2955,8214,29892,13138,16905,4902,1048,278,17402,896,526,1985,373,304,2048,385,5198,1540,1788,363,28273,681,24413,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,278,5198,1540,1788,896,526,5214,29892,541,8128,694,10757,470,9282,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,11539,278,13600,310,1009,9506,29889,13,29906,29889,6811,5527,5084,29901,450,25657,2444,975,368,24332,297,278,633,9770,310,1009,5198,1540,1788,29892,23659,393,372,508,6459,716,16661,322,7744,304,716,12455,1446,1728,13138,738,20382,848,470,5925,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,3030,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,3030,363,2020,385,5198,1540,1788,338,5181,363,28273,681,24413,29892,916,1135,3585,292,393,727,526,1023,4072,310,5198,1540,6757,297,278,3573,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,2274,278,29527,749,310,1009,2980,29889,13,29946,29889,478,351,3837,404,29901,3834,310,278,4958,1304,297,278,1301,924,526,25160,470,6460,368,3342,29892,1316,408,376,524,28286,19069,11381,29908,322,376,3090,482,1642,910,10225,310,7542,537,508,1207,372,5189,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,19098,8214,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889],"total_duration":77758295630,"load_duration":213493,"prompt_eval_count":255,"prompt_eval_duration":30203694000,"eval_count":317,"eval_duration":47553641000}
