The speaker presents some convincing arguments and uses specific examples to support their claims, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses the concept of \"archie\" (i.e., Russian archives) to support their argument that Renaud has been successful in Russia. They provide concrete examples of how they have managed to access these archives and use them to reconstruct the path of the brand in Russia. However, the speaker could have provided more context and evidence to support their claims about the effectiveness of their methodology.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could have been more rigorous in their reasoning when it comes to the second step of their approach, which involves gathering testimonies from people who have worked with Russians. While the speaker provides some interesting anecdotes and details, they could have gone deeper into the reasons why these experiences are important for understanding why Renaud was successful in Russia.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,544,8885,966,25766,316,4719,347,29892,316,21794,566,29892,373,4719,347,29892,1444,325,1759,1465,966,3190,347,29889,2581,1671,23469,7890,1153,535,357,14984,966,298,5137,2658,270,29915,1245,267,2535,966,3190,347,390,681,344,2535,553,17161,11689,29892,316,301,29915,25165,316,624,12818,29892,1750,17512,15532,577,4895,22527,454,7035,316,301,29915,16061,29892,3503,15093,2852,271,282,30000,29894,336,2073,1399,11936,575,519,1671,10252,276,454,9587,270,29915,812,29948,1484,455,362,1671,19397,1136,352,357,966,10701,12997,3783,634,427,4951,17789,582,533,454,26786,882,316,425,29452,427,4719,347,29889,26079,9397,904,941,412,29892,1444,1841,29883,4727,311,425,13349,5271,482,553,18554,316,521,1064,2386,566,29892,316,521,29948,412,20551,29892,1750,4625,29231,23589,2535,553,4719,583,29892,19154,553,5697,3246,385,687,29881,4769,29892,553,298,5137,2658,270,29915,1245,267,29892,25763,966,339,1379,1444,282,601,6609,966,20854,2234,16784,13805,1671,7199,9030,1671,339,7768,4325,265,29892,818,1841,1558,381,427,4719,347,29892,27093,712,8164,8121,261,29892,2257,24889,1249,7848,2245,29879,29889,6803,339,7768,2257,18848,29973,6101,21794,566,6303,20737,5814,1237,427,4719,347,29892,2123,29875,29892,1444,7890,1223,545,712,29871,4277,9577,14954,1173,634,6079,29892,3477,488,634,9667,29948,610,553,10890,23440,4637,7691,267,1750,3669,29882,1249,296,427,16573,1190,2257,8575,29948,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,1444,7890,1970,347,425,1162,2353,316,24113,316,21794,566,29889,1551,707,7732,2852,11603,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,2702,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,17583,3913,278,6964,310,376,1279,347,29908,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,10637,3190,3145,29897,304,2304,1009,2980,393,21794,566,756,1063,9150,297,12710,29889,2688,3867,18387,6455,310,920,896,505,8745,304,2130,1438,3190,3145,322,671,963,304,337,11433,278,2224,310,278,14982,297,12710,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,1009,1158,3002,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1063,901,12912,20657,297,1009,24481,746,372,5304,304,278,1473,4331,310,1009,2948,29892,607,20789,11705,292,1243,20170,583,515,2305,1058,505,3796,411,11688,1039,550,29889,5806,278,25657,8128,777,8031,385,687,29881,4769,322,4902,29892,896,1033,505,7695,25871,964,278,9590,2020,1438,27482,526,4100,363,8004,2020,21794,566,471,9150,297,12710,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":59525290994,"load_duration":290834,"prompt_eval_count":311,"prompt_eval_duration":26256010000,"eval_count":259,"eval_duration":33268386000}
