{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T03:41:11.453285044Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would score the speech as a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker presents several arguments to support their claim that the current system is flawed and needs to be changed, but some of these arguments are not fully developed or lack evidence to back them up. Additionally, the speaker's tone can come across as somewhat confrontational and dismissive of opposing viewpoints, which may undermine their credibility with some listeners.\n\nIn terms of rigor, the speaker's reasoning is generally sound, but there are some instances where they rely on simplistic or misleading analogies to make their point. For example, the comparison between the current system and a traffic jam is not particularly helpful in understanding the complex issues at play here. Similarly, the speaker's assertion that the current system is like a \"tired old car\" that needs to be replaced with a new one is overly simplistic and does not account for the many different factors that contribute to the functioning of a society.\n\nOverall, while the speaker has some valid points to make, their presentation could benefit from more nuance and depth in their arguments, as well as a more inclusive and respectful tone towards opposing viewpoints.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,966,9744,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,1750,3435,427,2058,316,425,6316,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,3196,6273,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,1857,1788,338,17422,8734,322,4225,304,367,3939,29892,541,777,310,1438,6273,526,451,8072,8906,470,10225,10757,304,1250,963,701,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,508,2041,4822,408,10579,21751,1288,322,18918,573,310,9209,292,1776,9748,29892,607,1122,563,837,457,1009,6625,4127,411,777,11621,414,29889,13,13,797,4958,310,12912,272,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,6892,6047,29892,541,727,526,777,8871,988,896,19104,373,5466,4695,470,3984,25369,15690,583,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,10230,1546,278,1857,1788,322,263,12469,14322,338,451,10734,8444,297,8004,278,4280,5626,472,1708,1244,29889,20175,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,278,1857,1788,338,763,263,376,29873,2859,2030,1559,29908,393,4225,304,367,8611,411,263,716,697,338,975,368,5466,4695,322,947,451,3633,363,278,1784,1422,13879,393,29126,304,278,740,292,310,263,12459,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,756,777,2854,3291,304,1207,29892,1009,24329,1033,14169,515,901,4948,749,322,10809,297,1009,6273,29892,408,1532,408,263,901,20978,573,322,3390,1319,16225,7113,9209,292,1776,9748,29889],"total_duration":75105779660,"load_duration":180453,"prompt_eval_count":361,"prompt_eval_duration":38061442000,"eval_count":267,"eval_duration":37043674000}
