{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T15:21:49.570838329Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning.\n\nThe speaker does a good job in presenting the historical context of artificial intelligence and robotics, and how their research aims to build upon this foundation by working in a dynamic and known environment. However, there are some areas where the speech could be improved:\n\n1. The speaker's claims could be more substantiated with empirical evidence or scientific studies to support their arguments. For example, they mention that their work on artificial intelligence will allow for better planning and decision-making in dynamic environments, but do not provide any specific examples or studies that demonstrate this.\n2. The speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous and logical. For instance, when discussing the limitations of traditional planning methods, they could have provided more detailed explanations of why these methods are insufficient in dynamic environments.\n3. The speech could benefit from a clearer structure and organization. At times, it seems disjointed or unfocused, with ideas presented without clear connections or transitions between them.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas and concepts, they could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based support to make their argument more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,269,29915,932,1808,425,3814,2450,634,454,266,5000,5882,316,611,266,17449,29889,4731,8105,882,29892,425,3814,2450,707,443,553,5354,267,6299,14075,316,301,29915,524,28286,19069,11381,29889,6340,263,3635,275,316,9484,261,553,10832,1862,4191,13704,29899,455,29889,6803,19449,1750,452,454,17043,19047,2331,29892,992,1654,28602,2131,29889,7747,19964,782,15243,9706,1437,1066,29948,1190,16852,427,29871,29906,29900,29900,29946,263,4370,1437,6915,29948,980,343,263,13545,3031,13116,7907,29871,29896,29945,8595,316,289,787,904,2376,2993,5786,634,29871,29896,29945,8595,316,3814,2450,29889,27816,29892,1671,712,872,3814,2450,18165,484,29892,980,21668,439,29915,309,409,7845,434,1465,443,12471,17239,13162,23855,882,1437,18821,29948,634,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,270,29915,14559,8820,712,966,269,22702,29889,5202,424,2970,712,1354,301,29915,23071,8182,11728,443,7438,819,29892,274,29915,342,18916,427,1841,6772,752,492,17851,29889,2598,18848,316,266,17449,270,29915,12572,2298,658,262,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,316,29231,5495,1465,443,12471,17239,4292,1387,634,443,25456,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,3667,895,443,2428,29882,10651,270,29915,3610,7289,712,7890,17043,5582,29920,9411,454,5147,345,585,3165,475,29889,8748,427,28353,7732,8774,3068,1608,267,29889,951,7017,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,297,2198,292,278,15839,3030,310,23116,21082,322,19964,1199,29892,322,920,1009,5925,263,9893,304,2048,2501,445,22778,491,1985,297,263,7343,322,2998,5177,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,16726,1033,367,901,5960,3656,630,411,29190,936,10757,470,16021,11898,304,2304,1009,6273,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,1009,664,373,23116,21082,674,2758,363,2253,18987,322,10608,29899,28990,297,7343,23136,29892,541,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,11898,393,22222,445,29889,13,29906,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,16667,29889,1152,2777,29892,746,5353,292,278,27028,310,13807,18987,3519,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,13173,7309,800,310,2020,1438,3519,526,1663,29884,4543,297,7343,23136,29889,13,29941,29889,450,12032,1033,14169,515,263,26135,3829,322,13013,29889,2180,3064,29892,372,2444,766,12090,287,470,29395,542,3880,29892,411,7014,9132,1728,2821,12368,470,1301,2187,1546,963,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,22001,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,2304,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":68995201686,"load_duration":279442,"prompt_eval_count":262,"prompt_eval_duration":29417864000,"eval_count":278,"eval_duration":39576488000}
