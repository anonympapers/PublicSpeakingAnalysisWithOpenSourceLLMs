{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T08:41:02.711282698Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and metaphor to drive home their point about the dangers of the parasite and the need for new strategies to combat it. However, there are some areas where the speaker could improve in terms of persuasiveness:\n\n1. Lack of concrete evidence: The speaker mentions that the parasite has developed resistance to the current treatment method, but they do not provide any concrete evidence or data to support this claim. Providing more specific examples or studies could help to make the argument more convincing.\n2. Too much repetition: While repetition can be an effective rhetorical device, it can also become repetitive and boring if overused. The speaker repeats certain phrases and ideas multiple times throughout the speech, which can detract from their overall impact.\n3. Lack of clear call to action: The speaker mentions that they are working on developing new strategies to combat the parasite, but they do not provide any clear guidance or recommendations for how the audience can help or get involved. Providing a clear call to action could help to motivate and engage the audience.\n4. Some confusing sentences: There are some sentences in the transcript that are difficult to follow or understand, such as \"Le but de ma thèse est de comprendre comment l'il est en fonction du sur ce paradis parce qu'on le sait siempre pas à l'heure actuelle, mais après 40 ans et de comprendre les mécanismes de résistance impliquées, vous compte cette moléculpe, pour développer de nouvelles stratégies d'huile.\" These sentences could be rephrased or clarified to make the argument more clear and easy to follow.\n\nOverall, while the speaker makes some good points about the parasite and the need for new strategies to combat it, there are areas where they could improve in terms of persuasiveness and clarity.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1190,5278,18249,29892,12866,432,29915,1794,443,10484,5606,1190,13704,868,521,2561,1750,286,29915,29874,1020,398,271,11728,1465,1601,12377,749,29889,3872,29883,2257,1147,479,14255,678,2561,427,7945,270,29915,5474,2123,454,4613,381,20141,904,7501,21611,361,634,8164,17424,30058,1089,425,5758,316,301,29915,273,3039,29889,1551,263,18097,6701,1597,564,1004,8474,2257,1147,479,29892,1597,6062,29948,1810,1387,1750,269,29915,932,1808,22469,29885,522,262,29889,22469,29885,522,262,263,4370,12128,11728,1465,966,8595,29871,29947,29900,12866,980,343,263,29871,29946,29900,6063,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,6722,4875,25698,5000,29889,315,29915,342,712,8997,4191,1671,966,385,1376,327,3783,634,966,289,627,4745,29892,966,1147,2710,4625,16797,29948,553,6896,391,2925,818,5278,6062,29948,1810,412,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,6722,432,29915,296,1975,1444,1314,29889,951,541,316,611,266,17449,707,316,7199,9030,3440,301,29915,309,707,427,18165,868,1190,2257,26811,275,610,346,439,29915,265,454,872,277,15237,2331,818,301,29915,28661,1044,13498,29892,3503,7907,29871,29946,29900,6063,634,316,7199,9030,966,8774,3068,1608,267,316,6896,21558,2411,28378,2406,29892,7890,16731,5278,6062,29948,1810,412,29892,1671,13942,29877,2496,316,26957,26742,2445,583,270,29915,6905,488,29889,3872,29883,373,263,18097,6701,13545,282,9230,29892,373,872,277,712,301,29915,309,707,427,2320,347,1190,454,21423,302,7143,1314,868,610,294,568,29889,3872,29883,1487,5147,345,585,707,2298,7175,3476,15471,1190,553,1841,13300,371,1295,29889,838,943,7015,1841,13300,371,1295,3435,5541,743,316,29871,29945,5898,1597,1178,1318,4191,29871,29945,437,335,1372,29889,8748,19172,276,454,13382,2123,2331,1465,443,2643,302,7143,1314,29889,317,29915,309,325,609,712,454,1841,13300,371,332,5898,29899,29894,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,1539,481,2015,304,7899,3271,1009,1298,1048,278,270,13873,310,278,610,294,568,322,278,817,363,716,16650,583,304,15499,372,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,18387,10757,29901,450,25657,26649,393,278,610,294,568,756,8906,17711,304,278,1857,14502,1158,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,445,5995,29889,9133,4821,901,2702,6455,470,11898,1033,1371,304,1207,278,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,29906,29889,1763,29877,1568,21159,654,29901,5806,21159,654,508,367,385,11828,364,9188,272,936,4742,29892,372,508,884,4953,21159,3321,322,289,8253,565,975,3880,29889,450,25657,5565,1446,3058,12216,2129,322,7014,2999,3064,10106,278,12032,29892,607,508,1439,1461,515,1009,12463,10879,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,2821,1246,304,3158,29901,450,25657,26649,393,896,526,1985,373,14338,716,16650,583,304,15499,278,610,294,568,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,2821,27323,470,6907,800,363,920,278,20026,508,1371,470,679,9701,29889,9133,4821,263,2821,1246,304,3158,1033,1371,304,17385,403,322,3033,482,278,20026,29889,13,29946,29889,3834,16051,25260,29901,1670,526,777,25260,297,278,1301,924,393,526,5189,304,1101,470,2274,29892,1316,408,376,3226,541,316,611,266,17449,707,316,7199,9030,3440,301,29915,309,707,427,18165,868,1190,2257,26811,275,610,346,439,29915,265,454,872,277,26692,2331,818,301,29915,28661,1044,13498,29892,3503,7907,29871,29946,29900,6063,634,316,7199,9030,966,8774,3068,1608,267,316,6896,21558,2411,28378,2406,29892,7890,16731,5278,6062,29948,1810,412,29892,1671,13942,29877,2496,316,26957,26742,2445,583,270,29915,6905,488,1213,4525,25260,1033,367,337,24588,1463,470,7542,2164,304,1207,278,2980,901,2821,322,4780,304,1101,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3732,777,1781,3291,1048,278,610,294,568,322,278,817,363,716,16650,583,304,15499,372,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,7542,537,29889],"total_duration":90838126631,"load_duration":252549,"prompt_eval_count":364,"prompt_eval_duration":33480316000,"eval_count":452,"eval_duration":57357031000}
