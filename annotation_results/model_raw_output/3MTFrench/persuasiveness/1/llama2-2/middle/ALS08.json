The speaker presents a clear and concise message, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their argument more convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could provide more evidence to support their claims about the importance of understanding the molecular structure of cells. While they mention that some molecules have a \"rôle fondamental\" and that poor cellular conditions can lead to \"dramatique\" consequences, they do not provide specific examples or studies to back up these claims. Adding more empirical evidence to their argument could make it more persuasive.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could provide a clearer explanation of how their proposed method of using a loto géant and micro-fledique en goutlette could actually work in practice. While they mention that this technology allows them to \"m'ignatureiser tout en laboratoire,\" it is not entirely clear how this process would allow them to identify the correct molecule among millions of possibilities. Providing more detail on the scientific principles behind their method could help to build credibility and make their argument more convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear message, there are some areas where they could improve to make their argument more persuasive and rigorous in terms of reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,454,2298,316,2257,10505,19783,598,25810,12866,316,19397,10252,276,805,4582,6832,339,882,1597,6062,29948,1810,484,29892,782,2757,316,425,5227,275,457,1424,29948,1056,24453,3038,352,1908,29889,1704,2123,29875,29892,3058,267,270,29915,14056,20554,3119,30000,25873,443,17889,6299,11491,29889,6101,20554,3435,286,585,1564,4637,1095,307,1169,2123,286,585,1564,4637,19462,29892,9201,20081,2123,1209,2406,29892,18729,8164,11469,553,1136,21871,2063,8541,19669,29892,9291,29915,30001,610,17488,3269,261,425,5758,316,425,3038,352,1297,2123,454,24305,270,29915,1540,4439,328,347,29889,11948,3440,22572,29915,15669,1444,16623,1671,16219,381,2257,10505,19783,598,6062,29948,1810,5218,1577,382,29882,6079,29892,432,29915,1794,24984,443,3287,29877,10505,424,29889,1720,21668,6382,4983,18402,10814,954,10651,260,29915,267,4191,19154,301,29915,348,553,5541,1934,316,425,6062,29948,1810,484,29889,8748,12866,18402,6062,29948,1810,484,29892,4191,19154,29892,1597,553,4145,1099,14125,6458,793,868,3287,29877,29889,2581,19760,270,29915,264,534,8885,25763,7015,14746,316,27829,7719,29892,454,2123,301,29915,2108,29884,634,454,8774,307,6249,291,29892,3038,267,1750,24257,818,409,29889,838,943,1120,424,7890,2970,712,1243,261,818,425,1667,1597,610,1540,7015,14746,316,6062,29948,1810,484,29892,274,29915,342,10655,9301,29889,315,29915,342,1671,29871,4277,712,1465,301,29915,18441,373,3667,895,425,9200,29899,29888,839,1387,427,330,449,20200,29889,10793,5722,5458,29892,4875,592,14924,316,286,29915,647,1535,7608,5646,427,10212,20141,29889,8526,425,2058,270,29915,4422,7608,553,23131,267,29892,432,29915,4422,895,553,5697,3246,330,449,13650,267,316,13545,282,5283,3246,29889,10793,263,2970,29892,270,29915,29891,1701,347,2298,22577,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2643,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,13500,310,8004,278,13206,16637,3829,310,9101,29889,5806,896,3585,393,777,13206,21337,505,263,376,29878,12161,6299,11491,29908,322,393,6460,3038,1070,5855,508,3275,304,376,29881,2572,15819,29908,27721,29892,896,437,451,3867,2702,6455,470,11898,304,1250,701,1438,16726,29889,18804,901,29190,936,10757,304,1009,2980,1033,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,263,26135,8252,310,920,1009,7972,1158,310,773,263,3287,29877,10505,424,322,9200,29899,29888,839,1387,427,330,449,20200,1033,2869,664,297,6944,29889,5806,896,3585,393,445,15483,6511,963,304,376,29885,29915,647,1535,7608,5646,427,10212,20141,1699,372,338,451,9186,2821,920,445,1889,723,2758,963,304,12439,278,1959,13206,29883,1297,4249,14746,310,24496,29889,9133,4821,901,9493,373,278,16021,18671,5742,1009,1158,1033,1371,304,2048,6625,4127,322,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,2643,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,297,4958,310,24481,29889],"total_duration":68954163054,"load_duration":221737,"prompt_eval_count":350,"prompt_eval_duration":32178630000,"eval_count":295,"eval_duration":36774821000}
