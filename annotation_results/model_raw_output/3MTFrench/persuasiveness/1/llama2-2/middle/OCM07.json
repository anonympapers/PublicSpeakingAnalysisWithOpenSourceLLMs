The speaker presents some interesting and innovative solutions to address the issue of pesticide use in agriculture, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's argument that champignons gentils (friendly mushrooms) can help protect crops from pests is intriguing. However, they do not provide enough evidence to support this claim. They simply mention that there are thousands of species of friendly mushrooms on Earth and that they have been discovered each day. While this information is interesting, it does not address the specific question of how these mushrooms can help protect crops. The speaker should provide more details on how the friendly mushrooms work and why they are effective in controlling pests.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's proposal to identify the friendly mushrooms through observation of fights between them and the toxic mushrooms is also not fully developed. They do not explain how they plan to observe these fights or what specific characteristics they will be looking for to identify the friendly mushrooms.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some creative solutions to address the issue of pesticide use in agriculture, their reasoning and evidence could be more rigorous and detailed to make a stronger case.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,365,29915,14531,634,301,29915,271,7681,561,1908,2331,260,29915,294,8171,443,29892,7209,8714,7907,29889,1720,285,9864,277,12866,9551,261,270,29915,14559,6851,3479,9221,12906,371,1295,1671,966,5528,7719,818,452,2298,3667,7608,3999,1391,1169,29892,5646,427,3133,424,316,410,6772,914,6267,9257,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,29892,18097,373,1301,29883,355,5646,443,13979,15532,316,18480,29582,712,301,29915,265,16391,5469,29880,944,1465,301,29915,21813,17239,29892,634,1750,409,3435,1029,1064,2406,2117,1849,270,29915,3451,30037,4630,2123,316,1841,700,533,425,410,11476,868,18480,29582,8774,13775,29889,478,681,301,29915,1351,29920,7199,275,29892,553,18480,647,787,8116,2719,29889,8748,7015,18480,647,787,8116,2719,29892,373,1863,296,427,5246,553,3533,4285,270,29915,9983,17893,1190,425,3814,12973,634,553,3533,4285,1750,3435,10440,4224,23048,18402,8694,29889,1720,21668,12866,534,8885,1597,1650,1671,15882,2258,455,944,966,339,1379,316,7015,18480,647,787,8116,2719,599,2406,818,734,966,15378,1295,1671,28640,276,966,18480,647,787,8774,13775,29889,1551,6427,8284,316,266,17449,29892,1136,2488,12866,818,22944,553,4145,1446,2637,18480,647,787,8116,2719,634,18480,29582,8774,13775,29889,435,29915,404,15802,316,6628,1314,7199,9030,966,26742,2445,583,553,18480,647,787,8116,2719,634,270,29915,25378,439,29915,4999,263,2073,29892,11797,22700,296,1671,1539,2484,439,29915,30001,22916,29892,6267,19901,5218,304,29916,1387,29889,1459,17488,29892,432,29915,711,16349,1354,454,18480,29582,8116,309,707,15390,270,29915,264,1365,7598,553,6062,29948,21337,1750,325,609,16317,2736,276,454,18480,29582,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,322,24233,1230,6851,304,3211,278,2228,310,282,15931,680,671,297,18032,545,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,18480,647,787,8116,2719,313,18326,368,286,1878,18901,29897,508,1371,12566,8182,567,515,282,9197,338,11158,5526,292,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,2688,3763,3585,393,727,526,17202,310,6606,310,19780,286,1878,18901,373,11563,322,393,896,505,1063,10943,1269,2462,29889,5806,445,2472,338,8031,29892,372,947,451,3211,278,2702,1139,310,920,1438,286,1878,18901,508,1371,12566,8182,567,29889,450,25657,881,3867,901,4902,373,920,278,19780,286,1878,18901,664,322,2020,896,526,11828,297,640,22155,282,9197,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24963,304,12439,278,19780,286,1878,18901,1549,15500,310,285,5861,1546,963,322,278,304,27375,286,1878,18901,338,884,451,8072,8906,29889,2688,437,451,5649,920,896,3814,304,14111,1438,285,5861,470,825,2702,21862,896,674,367,3063,363,304,12439,278,19780,286,1878,18901,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,907,1230,6851,304,3211,278,2228,310,282,15931,680,671,297,18032,545,29892,1009,24481,322,10757,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,13173,304,1207,263,23505,1206,29889],"total_duration":75538644666,"load_duration":276638,"prompt_eval_count":326,"prompt_eval_duration":34111236000,"eval_count":299,"eval_duration":41426639000}
