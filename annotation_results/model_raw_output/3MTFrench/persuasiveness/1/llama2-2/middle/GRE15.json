{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T13:42:54.363125917Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of clear argumentation: The speaker jumps around between different topics without developing a clear and coherent argument. They mention \"Gronna,\" \"jupiter,\" \"Castle andyenne,\" and \"la planète tentant\" without explaining how these relate to the main topic of the speech. This lack of clear structure and logical flow makes it difficult for the listener to follow the speaker's reasoning.\n2. Inconsistent use of language: The speaker switches between French and English within the same sentence, which can be confusing for the listener. For example, they say \"il se jupiter\" in one sentence and \"la planète tentant\" in another. This inconsistency undermines the speaker's credibility and makes it harder to understand their message.\n3. Unclear claims: The speaker makes some assertions that are not well-supported or defined. For example, they claim that scientists are \"plus carrés\" than other people, without providing any evidence or explanation for this statement. This vagueness makes it difficult to evaluate the speaker's claims or understand their perspective.\n4. Lack of evidence: The speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or data to support their arguments. They simply make general statements and assertions without offering any specific examples or proof. This lack of evidence makes it hard for the listener to evaluate the speaker's claims or take them seriously.\n\nOverall, while the speaker has some interesting ideas and observations, they do not present a clear or persuasive argument in this transcript.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,274,29915,342,2331,15237,9577,5713,519,29889,6803,7848,269,30095,29878,553,7019,558,575,270,29915,919,1080,29892,454,26713,2730,11771,274,29915,342,10440,270,29915,12572,325,1064,3709,29889,11948,4788,29920,818,402,1617,1056,1671,8689,1354,454,2298,29892,274,29915,342,16623,519,29889,838,11867,29892,980,409,432,786,1524,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,2298,752,492,17851,29889,315,29915,342,14333,3055,277,712,274,29915,342,9301,439,29915,309,21668,11807,1089,29892,3503,966,9638,361,3783,3435,2298,1559,19199,818,2257,712,29871,4277,29889,405,29915,283,2204,787,2331,966,432,786,1524,29892,15194,322,29891,4584,29892,16623,787,6003,381,443,432,786,1524,818,8556,29889,1174,4951,29892,610,425,3814,12973,12033,424,260,29915,264,19493,261,4457,265,373,26030,13545,25698,19503,29889,838,943,29892,373,263,6787,277,443,878,15340,1841,700,277,634,5466,29792,29892,1750,8164,23990,2872,1465,611,269,3498,316,10212,20141,634,1190,22025,1444,1236,1314,9073,316,5697,3246,1518,4894,2063,29889,9353,611,1243,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,18484,1750,20423,3669,600,1358,818,4595,21206,1808,1190,1597,3814,12973,29889,6803,26997,2257,712,432,29915,296,1975,1190,966,13830,29892,432,29915,296,1672,29928,3120,29903,1465,611,3814,12973,20629,1535,29892,1437,29894,787,2560,634,25456,634,432,29915,4582,2663,872,1841,1713,29889,6101,1444,16623,454,1147,276,29892,454,9668,1705,610,17488,29892,634,712,432,29915,296,1975,443,3248,29889,315,3100,2453,329,2970,712,1354,980,343,263,443,3248,1465,301,29915,262,4951,634,712,432,29915,296,1975,443,3248,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,2980,362,29901,450,25657,432,17204,2820,1546,1422,23820,1728,14338,263,2821,322,16165,261,296,2980,29889,2688,3585,376,29954,1617,1056,1699,376,29926,786,1524,1699,376,15738,280,322,29891,4584,1699,322,376,433,3814,12973,12033,424,29908,1728,24232,920,1438,29279,304,278,1667,11261,310,278,12032,29889,910,10225,310,2821,3829,322,16667,4972,3732,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,29889,13,29906,29889,512,3200,9696,671,310,4086,29901,450,25657,4607,267,1546,5176,322,4223,2629,278,1021,10541,29892,607,508,367,16051,363,278,13254,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1827,376,309,409,432,786,1524,29908,297,697,10541,322,376,433,3814,12973,12033,424,29908,297,1790,29889,910,22435,391,3819,563,837,1475,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,322,3732,372,22622,304,2274,1009,2643,29889,13,29941,29889,853,8551,16726,29901,450,25657,3732,777,4974,1080,393,526,451,1532,29899,23765,470,3342,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,9638,2879,526,376,11242,1559,19199,29908,1135,916,2305,29892,1728,13138,738,10757,470,8252,363,445,3229,29889,910,325,351,3837,404,3732,372,5189,304,14707,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,470,2274,1009,18520,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,6273,29889,2688,3763,1207,2498,9506,322,4974,1080,1728,27032,738,2702,6455,470,5296,29889,910,10225,310,10757,3732,372,2898,363,278,13254,304,14707,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,470,2125,963,25798,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,756,777,8031,7014,322,13917,29892,896,437,451,2198,263,2821,470,20408,294,573,2980,297,445,1301,924,29889],"total_duration":156553865628,"load_duration":265726,"prompt_eval_count":320,"prompt_eval_duration":29358493000,"eval_count":371,"eval_duration":127194536000}
