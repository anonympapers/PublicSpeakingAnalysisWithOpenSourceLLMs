The speaker presents their argument in a creative and engaging way by using a reverse recipe analogy to explain the concept of diatomaceous earth. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and persuasive.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more scientific evidence to support their claims. While they mention that the jelle is made up of complex molecules, they do not provide any specific examples or references to scientific studies that demonstrate this. Providing more concrete evidence would have strengthened their argument and made it more persuasive.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments more directly. For example, they could have acknowledged the potential limitations of their approach, such as the fact that diatomaceous earth is not a single entity but rather an assortment of different components. Addressing these counterarguments directly and providing a clear explanation of how their approach accounts for these limitations would have made their argument more persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents an interesting and creative argument, there are areas where they could have improved the rigor and persuasiveness of their reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,439,29915,1540,2258,568,18618,409,432,15340,1465,966,269,2487,7862,29892,14924,270,29915,2987,358,261,10713,16165,29948,1080,634,316,2485,1524,5162,882,10713,22500,1883,1080,29889,838,943,29892,3440,7199,9030,454,17889,316,2257,432,15340,1577,16579,802,6063,29892,373,409,5663,6223,782,17043,13639,454,315,375,262,29892,1661,1577,382,29882,6079,29892,14034,29920,9073,1597,1162,2353,316,315,375,262,3503,818,301,29915,264,874,29889,478,681,8992,29920,454,1437,346,381,2186,634,980,21668,1791,261,818,301,29915,1672,6572,700,533,29889,24337,1162,2353,29892,425,286,681,344,782,521,542,324,271,316,4671,8678,29948,316,301,29915,12787,1389,5218,29889,9353,443,7017,8714,29892,7814,2348,29878,2487,10070,29889,838,943,29892,24145,432,15340,29892,7814,269,1849,634,7814,1852,5475,29889,315,29915,342,443,25698,5000,29889,24337,432,15340,707,443,24367,6184,13162,5949,316,6062,29948,21337,29889,422,1004,1671,966,23778,29892,980,21668,12866,454,7175,862,261,29889,365,29915,1893,566,631,23068,818,553,6987,2927,29948,8774,509,293,29889,1174,6079,4595,3184,29889,315,3100,1804,28821,1027,2037,712,425,3581,20519,868,1243,337,1579,12973,425,325,898,749,316,23563,5541,743,29889,1459,17488,29892,553,410,6772,1475,29889,10016,10098,29892,7814,2348,29878,2487,10070,1539,3780,10978,1671,9483,533,24145,1374,1690,290,8146,5469,29880,29892,980,8556,9378,277,316,2723,275,4983,24145,286,681,344,782,10212,20141,29889,11948,301,29915,264,4026,29892,24145,432,15340,29892,7814,1852,5475,634,7814,269,1849,29889,1174,13495,29892,8689,1354,425,1162,2353,263,18165,5483,1950,29889,1174,20744,29892,373,8164,23532,553,20612,868,1374,1690,290,8146,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,907,1230,322,3033,6751,982,491,773,263,11837,9522,412,3483,6933,304,5649,278,6964,310,652,8678,815,681,8437,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,16021,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,432,1808,338,1754,701,310,4280,13206,21337,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,9282,304,16021,11898,393,22222,445,29889,9133,4821,901,18387,10757,723,505,9324,6419,1009,2980,322,1754,372,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,901,4153,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,24084,3192,278,7037,27028,310,1009,2948,29892,1316,408,278,2114,393,652,8678,815,681,8437,338,451,263,2323,7855,541,3265,385,1223,441,358,310,1422,7117,29889,16428,292,1438,6795,25699,4153,322,13138,263,2821,8252,310,920,1009,2948,15303,363,1438,27028,723,505,1754,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,385,8031,322,907,1230,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,505,16710,278,12912,272,322,20408,294,20193,310,1009,24481,29889],"total_duration":61867714396,"load_duration":325474,"prompt_eval_count":336,"prompt_eval_duration":28340910000,"eval_count":270,"eval_duration":33525906000}
