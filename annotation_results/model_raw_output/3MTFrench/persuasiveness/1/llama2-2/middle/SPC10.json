{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T00:18:05.688849862Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker does provide some convincing arguments and examples to support their claim that superconductors can be achieved at lower temperatures than previously thought. They highlight the potential benefits of using superconductors, such as reducing energy consumption and creating intense magnetic fields for medical applications. However, the speaker's enthusiasm and confidence in their claims may come across as overly simplistic or unrealistic to some listeners, especially those who are not familiar with the subject matter.\n\nRigorous reasoning: The speaker does provide some logical explanations for how superconductors work and why they are important. However, there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker mentions that the reason why superconductors can operate at lower temperatures is because of their \"little name,\" but they do not provide any scientific evidence or explanations to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's use of analogies and metaphors to explain complex concepts may oversimplify the issues and could be seen as a lack of rigorous reasoning.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does present some compelling arguments and examples, their persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning could be improved with more detailed explanations and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,2298,316,639,371,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,1551,623,1808,29871,4277,425,2428,23074,2199,440,2131,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,1671,343,564,3511,29892,980,21668,5153,9030,818,9577,2362,344,5694,19113,29889,6803,966,19507,12628,6701,29871,29900,30073,29892,274,29915,342,1597,363,29876,17449,9301,316,301,29915,29948,1052,2527,29889,9353,425,715,786,442,553,8774,386,2631,29892,980,21668,5153,9030,818,11387,29871,29906,29953,29945,30073,29889,11948,19601,29892,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,553,8774,386,2631,29892,980,9378,277,316,5153,9030,818,11387,29871,29896,29946,29900,30073,29889,8396,29892,3431,29892,274,29915,342,10440,285,1007,29889,11948,29892,8182,4099,29920,29899,4346,29875,29892,274,29915,342,21394,2298,2258,21873,818,21609,19844,29889,315,29915,342,11510,356,1750,15210,316,2428,23074,2199,5411,818,11387,29871,29896,29946,29900,30073,1671,712,454,17887,2245,316,13949,558,271,29889,478,681,7890,26427,29920,8164,29899,5474,6722,373,8164,534,8885,7015,27965,1314,13949,558,1446,29889,8526,301,29915,29882,30069,29886,2410,29892,610,17488,29892,1465,966,623,598,2719,29892,980,343,263,390,29924,29889,315,29915,342,23068,3479,10850,28141,2428,23074,2199,11669,270,29915,29948,13949,558,1446,712,301,29915,265,8164,9484,261,818,7015,1437,29876,20608,631,19507,374,1912,1671,6094,29539,553,11179,567,9119,1893,3783,938,11259,29892,3966,812,2406,454,14913,3165,475,29889,11948,29892,301,29915,29948,13949,558,271,29892,373,452,872,277,2331,3440,29871,4277,1766,1173,29889,838,943,29892,1671,966,7199,9030,29892,1465,1601,3858,29892,1444,24853,443,7006,26946,453,424,316,425,2085,316,1841,29883,5606,29889,9353,5278,2085,479,29892,1444,4313,12161,5646,29892,1444,4313,12161,29892,872,260,8284,29892,872,5694,19113,29892,454,5419,270,29915,3610,30000,1960,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,3867,777,17953,3277,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,393,2428,535,2199,943,508,367,14363,472,5224,6238,3698,1135,9251,2714,29889,2688,12141,278,7037,23633,310,773,2428,535,2199,943,29892,1316,408,27668,5864,27430,322,4969,17818,344,15611,4235,363,16083,8324,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,322,16420,297,1009,16726,1122,2041,4822,408,975,368,5466,4695,470,443,6370,4695,304,777,11621,414,29892,7148,1906,1058,526,451,9985,411,278,4967,4383,29889,13,13,29934,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,947,3867,777,16667,7309,800,363,920,2428,535,2199,943,664,322,2020,896,526,4100,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,2769,2020,2428,535,2199,943,508,21994,472,5224,6238,3698,338,1363,310,1009,376,29880,1992,1024,1699,541,896,437,451,3867,738,16021,10757,470,7309,800,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,15690,583,322,1539,12451,943,304,5649,4280,22001,1122,288,874,13699,1598,278,5626,322,1033,367,3595,408,263,10225,310,12912,20657,24481,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,2198,777,752,7807,6273,322,6455,29892,1009,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,1033,367,16710,411,901,13173,7309,800,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":68077949186,"load_duration":194550,"prompt_eval_count":355,"prompt_eval_duration":30054175000,"eval_count":307,"eval_duration":38023149000}
