The speaker presents a clear and concise argument for why the current technology is too expensive and how their new technology could provide a solution by using mercury particles as photocurrent generators. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. The speaker assumes that the audience is familiar with the concept of quantiques properties without fully explaining them. A brief explanation of what these properties are and why they are important for the new technology would help to make the argument more convincing.\n2. While the speaker mentions that the mercury particles can be synthesized easily, they do not provide any evidence or examples of how this is done in practice. Providing more details on the synthesis process and its scalability could help to build credibility for the new technology.\n3. The speaker does not address potential counterarguments or risks associated with using mercury particles. While it is important to present a compelling argument, it is also crucial to consider alternative perspectives and potential drawbacks of the proposed solution. Addressing these concerns could help to make the argument more persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and comprehensive to fully convince the audience of the new technology's potential.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,339,7768,1577,8748,6079,610,346,439,29915,4999,3435,9201,14954,29889,8748,454,541,316,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,13942,29877,2496,1597,15217,5722,5458,1671,19397,289,1759,643,454,19590,29889,6803,18729,29892,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,270,29915,348,1775,4894,585,1750,2947,325,1064,3709,7732,3994,5908,29889,315,5385,443,707,2143,18703,280,818,10135,374,7808,29889,315,5385,443,29871,29906,29892,17977,495,966,297,1341,279,21167,29892,1444,6079,269,30095,29878,29889,3067,29883,5385,29871,29941,29892,980,2258,566,8356,439,29915,309,3588,5582,5278,17977,683,553,297,1341,279,21167,427,21907,12784,316,2258,21873,818,29188,261,29889,853,2085,424,19507,14090,610,17488,29889,1459,2460,966,364,5114,7105,1446,29892,373,16391,966,16530,690,316,13745,536,267,316,2778,2764,29889,12390,16530,690,409,14710,1893,19047,2258,455,944,634,427,2298,29892,20554,3435,20612,7512,11669,29889,315,29915,342,818,2970,712,425,19703,5289,439,29915,4999,20423,7848,3588,1169,427,2085,424,19507,14090,29889,461,7243,484,3479,899,7147,1577,1174,2298,29892,20554,6425,11831,296,966,297,1341,279,21167,29892,3503,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,818,1597,4195,439,29915,265,966,10135,14090,316,425,289,7293,260,8284,29889,1174,20744,29892,7015,16530,690,4625,553,10850,28141,443,7006,1936,14549,5908,439,29915,265,623,1808,966,10850,28141,439,3656,1912,29889,951,1134,316,19703,5289,439,29915,4999,6425,11831,296,1437,14081,316,6267,260,8284,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,1597,10850,7342,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2980,363,2020,278,1857,15483,338,2086,19390,322,920,1009,716,15483,1033,3867,263,1650,491,773,2778,2764,29891,17105,408,6731,542,1264,1176,4097,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,15894,393,278,20026,338,9985,411,278,6964,310,439,3656,1912,4426,1728,8072,24232,963,29889,319,11473,8252,310,825,1438,4426,526,322,2020,896,526,4100,363,278,716,15483,723,1371,304,1207,278,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,29906,29889,5806,278,25657,26649,393,278,2778,2764,29891,17105,508,367,14710,267,1891,5948,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,10757,470,6455,310,920,445,338,2309,297,6944,29889,9133,4821,901,4902,373,278,14710,6656,1889,322,967,8716,3097,1033,1371,304,2048,6625,4127,363,278,716,15483,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,947,451,3211,7037,6795,25699,470,5161,2039,6942,411,773,2778,2764,29891,17105,29889,5806,372,338,4100,304,2198,263,752,7807,2980,29892,372,338,884,7618,1455,304,2050,8671,3736,1103,3145,322,7037,4216,1627,29879,310,278,7972,1650,29889,16428,292,1438,21838,1033,1371,304,1207,278,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,15171,6270,304,8072,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,716,15483,29915,29879,7037,29889],"total_duration":67437129239,"load_duration":222077,"prompt_eval_count":306,"prompt_eval_duration":26125485000,"eval_count":312,"eval_duration":41310792000}
