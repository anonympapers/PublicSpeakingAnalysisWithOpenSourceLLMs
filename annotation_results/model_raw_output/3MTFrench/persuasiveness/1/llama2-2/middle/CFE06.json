{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T11:20:42.382213802Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker is able to effectively use rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \"il est commercialisé depuis plus de sois-sendants\") and emotional appeals (e.g., \"Il est là que j'intervient avec une approche extrêmement innovante utilisant un animal\" to make their point. However, the speaker's claims are not always supported by evidence, which may reduce the persuasiveness of their message. For example, while they mention that the backterie has been commercialized for over 10 years, there is no concrete data or research presented to support its effectiveness in treating candidiasis or vaginal recediment.\n2. Rigor of reasoning: The speaker's argumentation is sometimes flawed. For instance, they claim that the backterie has a minus cul vert de 1 mm of length, which is not a clear or quantifiable measure. Additionally, their comparison of humans to animals is not always logical or well-supported. While it is true that some animals have similar characteristics to humans (e.g., nose, ears), it is not clear how this relates to the effectiveness of the backterie.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some creativity and rhetorical skill in their argumentation, there are some significant gaps in evidence and logical consistency that detract from their persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,26099,269,30095,29878,712,7890,17043,5582,29920,7015,5697,3246,1250,357,1150,275,325,5326,1750,7890,2453,352,296,868,6079,634,439,29915,265,18948,484,13214,1465,454,343,29899,29874,29899,449,29892,301,29915,627,488,818,610,17488,29889,29871,30219,29874,5246,7890,1671,339,7768,1577,6340,8556,263,680,818,28640,276,966,282,10870,3479,330,22702,634,818,4325,1454,2265,7814,13107,19503,5198,5441,7147,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,6427,8284,1190,1597,1250,357,347,427,28353,454,365,29899,29941,29945,29889,1720,707,12128,11728,8997,2298,316,577,275,29899,6717,1934,29892,1671,966,8324,330,23364,524,342,979,267,29892,3503,26154,1671,454,1020,17334,553,7105,1446,2123,325,351,979,267,1841,29883,2487,2073,267,29889,26219,712,966,1801,1691,289,25747,29888,3783,577,993,544,5128,743,9638,6832,339,882,29892,3435,18893,316,18165,17239,18062,818,2257,8694,5573,882,8774,535,3433,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,712,432,29915,1639,29894,993,2535,1597,2134,1173,17541,19553,882,744,24233,1647,22700,424,443,13019,29889,26383,19601,29892,2331,316,425,6788,29892,316,1153,2123,14857,269,473,275,29892,1661,1661,1661,29889,853,26134,13949,4837,316,29871,29896,5654,316,1472,29892,274,29915,342,443,470,4760,2488,634,966,330,1934,29889,11948,1671,339,7768,3911,1577,8748,6079,29892,8182,4099,29920,29899,4346,29875,1190,610,1772,29892,3503,1354,18729,452,12852,2331,3479,26809,29892,8556,8556,18475,13365,787,904,12324,15471,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,671,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,309,707,12128,11728,8997,2298,316,577,275,29899,6717,1934,1159,322,23023,1848,5929,1338,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,14126,707,18916,712,432,29915,1639,29894,993,2535,1597,2134,1173,17541,19553,882,24233,1647,22700,424,443,13019,29908,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,526,451,2337,6969,491,10757,29892,607,1122,10032,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2643,29889,1152,1342,29892,1550,896,3585,393,278,1250,357,347,756,1063,12128,1891,363,975,29871,29896,29900,2440,29892,727,338,694,18387,848,470,5925,9132,304,2304,967,2779,20193,297,2578,1218,7105,3173,275,470,325,351,979,337,1133,2073,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,362,338,6041,17422,8734,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,5995,393,278,1250,357,347,756,263,26134,13949,4837,316,29871,29896,5654,310,3309,29892,607,338,451,263,2821,470,4323,28677,5645,29889,19814,29892,1009,10230,310,25618,304,15006,338,451,2337,16667,470,1532,29899,23765,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,777,15006,505,2788,21862,304,25618,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,26414,29892,22827,511,372,338,451,2821,920,445,1104,1078,304,278,2779,20193,310,278,1250,357,347,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,907,28157,322,364,9188,272,936,19911,297,1009,2980,362,29892,727,526,777,7282,330,2547,297,10757,322,16667,5718,3819,393,1439,1461,515,1009,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889],"total_duration":153918054321,"load_duration":257713,"prompt_eval_count":291,"prompt_eval_duration":28231648000,"eval_count":355,"eval_duration":125685463000}
