The speaker provides some relevant information and examples to support their argument, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by introducing the topic of how working conditions can influence one's health, which is a relevant and important issue. However, they then jump quickly into a list of suspected factors without providing enough context or evidence to support their claims. For example, they mention that \"il existe un testin,\" but do not provide any further information about what this test is or how it is used to determine the acupability of suspects.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of colloquial language and slang (e.g. \"pote-chère,\" \"drôle-mongue\") can make their message less clear and convincing to a general audience. While it is important to be authentic and use language that is natural for the speaker, it is also important to consider the audience's perspective and adjust the language accordingly.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the topic, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message could be more clearly conveyed to a general audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,838,943,29892,3440,29231,5495,29892,8164,29899,309,427,1579,3837,2265,6267,20877,29948,1577,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,5646,301,29915,711,4026,316,611,266,17449,29892,7199,9030,439,29915,4999,3435,966,7877,29948,1860,29892,2858,1547,13876,270,29915,13453,3837,2265,425,3681,819,2123,316,3038,267,3041,359,29892,14255,966,9221,12906,371,1295,29889,2581,16623,346,712,1601,16794,316,301,29915,29948,5935,2249,347,5458,29892,18402,1775,262,29892,1444,592,966,427,29880,15792,425,282,866,29899,305,1908,301,29915,351,290,346,29889,838,943,29892,425,8861,904,941,412,16374,1791,261,425,13773,316,12326,29889,6212,2509,29892,1354,20319,452,2453,329,2331,1671,1120,424,2970,712,2331,569,29892,260,29915,264,4771,425,5814,2673,270,29915,1789,9948,29889,315,3100,301,29915,5753,398,2785,316,544,29145,2123,270,29915,513,1575,19172,336,316,1437,4951,381,2123,1661,29892,301,29915,562,786,4427,2131,270,29915,1144,375,1103,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,1354,1601,10420,29892,425,13773,269,29915,328,3901,818,4192,12161,29899,29885,549,434,29889,8407,9587,316,6267,6316,6351,23497,29892,966,9221,12906,371,1295,4079,28374,6483,29881,1379,9853,267,316,4185,1973,29892,5898,29899,264,29892,966,4239,427,6701,8714,29889,8748,29892,21668,8648,5646,443,21285,316,260,30057,6609,27858,904,1707,3197,29892,1841,1054,2167,29892,3435,553,3778,2993,29892,553,8324,16253,277,296,29892,610,8556,427,1437,3364,261,274,1458,29889,1720,19947,443,1243,262,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,20408,1943,1009,20026,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8018,2472,322,6455,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,4547,3277,278,11261,310,920,1985,5855,508,9949,697,29915,29879,9045,29892,607,338,263,8018,322,4100,2228,29889,2398,29892,896,769,12500,9098,964,263,1051,310,2858,6021,13879,1728,13138,3307,3030,470,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,376,309,19947,443,1243,262,1699,541,437,451,3867,738,4340,2472,1048,825,445,1243,338,470,920,372,338,1304,304,8161,278,1274,786,3097,310,12326,29879,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,784,417,339,616,4086,322,2243,574,313,29872,29889,29887,29889,376,29886,866,29899,305,1908,1699,376,7707,12161,29899,29885,549,434,1159,508,1207,1009,2643,3109,2821,322,17953,3277,304,263,2498,20026,29889,5806,372,338,4100,304,367,15585,322,671,4086,393,338,5613,363,278,25657,29892,372,338,884,4100,304,2050,278,20026,29915,29879,18520,322,10365,278,4086,16205,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,11261,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2643,1033,367,901,9436,27769,287,304,263,2498,20026,29889],"total_duration":59728664966,"load_duration":310079,"prompt_eval_count":297,"prompt_eval_duration":25100450000,"eval_count":284,"eval_duration":34627273000}
