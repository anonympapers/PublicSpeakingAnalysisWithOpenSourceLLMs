{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T08:07:02.92571732Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present a rigorous argument.\n\nThe speaker provides some interesting insights into the nature of time and its relationship with human existence. They argue that time is not just a linear concept, but rather a multifaceted one that is closely tied to human movement and change. The speaker also touches on the idea that time is not just a external force that governs human existence, but rather an internal one that shapes our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker's argument could be strengthened. For example, the speaker does not provide any clear definitions or explanations of key terms such as \"mouvement\" and \"changement,\" which makes it difficult to fully understand their argument. Additionally, the speaker's reasoning is sometimes vague or abstract, which can make it hard to follow their train of thought.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas about time and its relationship with human existence, there are areas where their argument could be more rigorous and well-defined.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,454,8714,1750,10259,5889,7209,8182,9948,29889,997,9115,332,2778,29892,454,8714,1465,6267,904,386,2093,29892,425,29188,316,7015,1874,4110,427,24113,361,29892,2637,29871,29896,29900,29900,634,29871,29896,29900,29900,634,29871,29896,29900,29900,29892,634,1487,4370,298,9373,944,29889,1174,611,410,5815,457,270,29915,279,391,866,29892,1444,1236,1314,7199,9030,712,8556,24684,787,409,503,381,454,8714,818,13310,454,25924,6722,454,1874,882,707,454,1437,2576,2131,29889,11948,274,29915,342,443,1750,302,29915,29874,2002,993,2331,443,611,12470,29892,439,29915,342,2257,712,454,8714,610,13659,818,301,29915,21708,29892,270,29915,29877,30071,454,8714,282,533,29899,29873,29899,309,1487,19397,1577,2581,26099,269,879,275,712,390,1794,29899,29928,2445,538,7905,301,29915,332,1791,276,1314,29892,634,2535,3911,443,3144,11537,12103,1908,29889,951,8714,707,2298,619,29948,782,25924,3503,443,5535,3911,1750,454,27666,29889,319,301,29915,21708,1750,19947,29889,951,8714,452,21714,610,263,680,29899,29880,29915,21708,4191,443,7284,11482,2344,29889,365,29915,21708,707,454,8714,29892,980,707,1487,8714,818,3911,1750,707,25921,29889,8748,782,1472,316,872,6316,29892,301,29915,21708,18948,484,1224,3911,6701,1671,409,7199,9030,29889,853,3999,410,27499,316,8714,1224,1487,263,15470,634,454,6664,993,818,1487,1209,29948,634,425,269,2017,29889,8748,1465,5278,10695,583,344,1667,868,1209,29948,29892,301,29915,21708,425,5582,818,301,29915,404,663,427,22847,1671,454,9364,276,29889,365,29915,21708,427,9364,424,1465,1597,3686,663,1120,424,29889,11948,1354,301,29915,21708,707,1487,8714,29892,980,18332,1597,3686,663,1120,424,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,263,12912,20657,2980,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,5469,310,931,322,967,9443,411,5199,10379,29889,2688,27754,393,931,338,451,925,263,5608,6964,29892,541,3265,263,1773,361,562,300,287,697,393,338,16467,21351,304,5199,10298,322,1735,29889,450,25657,884,6023,267,373,278,2969,393,931,338,451,925,263,7029,4889,393,14765,1983,5199,10379,29892,541,3265,385,7463,697,393,25834,1749,8004,310,20278,322,1749,2058,297,278,3186,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,2821,15848,470,7309,800,310,1820,4958,1316,408,376,29885,5128,882,29908,322,376,305,574,882,1699,607,3732,372,5189,304,8072,2274,1009,2980,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,6041,25160,470,9846,29892,607,508,1207,372,2898,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,1048,931,322,967,9443,411,5199,10379,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,2980,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,12119,29889],"total_duration":60530023607,"load_duration":258221,"prompt_eval_count":332,"prompt_eval_duration":30137423000,"eval_count":252,"eval_duration":30391763000}
