The speaker presents two plans to escape the grain of beauty and invade other organs, which is a creative and innovative approach. However, the argument could be more convincing if the speaker provided more evidence and logical explanations to support their claims.\n\nThe first plan, creating small structures that can climb up the wall using rensoquals, is an interesting idea. The speaker uses a metaphor of using egails to illustrate their point, which is a creative way to explain the process. However, they could have provided more details on how these structures would function and why they would be effective in escaping the grain of beauty.\n\nThe second plan, creating structures that can invade like pioques, is also an interesting idea. The speaker explains that these structures can help mes nanomins to reach other organs and develop there. However, they could have provided more details on how these structures would be able to invade the body and why they would be successful in evading the prison.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some creative ideas, their argument could benefit from more evidence and logical explanations to make it more convincing and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,270,29915,29948,4428,291,29889,8526,325,17016,2970,29892,4239,13900,619,3435,6458,793,29889,1720,8164,5646,270,29915,24430,9484,261,553,5697,1169,12286,1750,4625,16794,818,553,364,8013,339,1338,29892,1750,325,609,3911,19172,276,316,867,26039,17887,818,17887,454,1472,868,7167,1671,409,285,974,3955,1465,966,2258,7545,634,269,29915,17192,23239,29889,315,29915,342,443,7006,4191,1354,270,29915,271,650,3667,15826,553,7779,30000,793,427,5246,29889,1551,610,280,8532,316,20332,29889,951,1473,3814,3911,1136,2488,818,9484,261,553,12286,1750,20423,2437,1664,443,7006,4191,553,282,601,6609,634,1465,2257,3209,373,610,280,316,553,4656,800,29889,1632,20032,818,7015,13900,29892,4883,23432,290,1144,8164,439,5171,454,2646,262,316,6562,29948,634,19136,19844,270,29915,14559,2894,267,1671,269,29915,29891,27786,634,269,29915,29891,13942,29877,2496,29889,26219,269,30095,29878,29892,454,315,409,8475,11697,270,574,406,1314,427,17176,29948,1465,26814,14913,302,29915,342,2331,3669,29882,1249,519,29889,315,29915,342,1671,18729,439,29915,309,19947,7848,2852,882,1998,424,818,3710,30037,4630,966,6910,316,4883,23432,290,1144,29889,2216,10460,427,6668,12150,966,21206,4999,29889,11948,18916,782,14913,29892,4883,23432,290,1144,707,5695,20854,30030,312,29872,712,7814,12134,5227,275,818,270,29915,284,880,4515,29889,3792,20792,14984,7015,12033,5056,270,29915,29948,4428,291,29892,818,1147,2872,29892,980,6773,270,29915,404,2747,316,269,29915,5903,1664,29889,478,681,992,4099,29920,7890,29892,966,3038,2540,452,1671,24416,2298,3667,7608,966,21206,4999,29889,1551,5646,1027,2037,13472,465,29948,13260,8501,316,282,601,6609,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,1023,13900,304,10169,278,2646,262,310,15409,322,297,1564,311,916,1638,550,29892,607,338,263,907,1230,322,24233,1230,2948,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,367,901,17953,3277,565,278,25657,4944,901,10757,322,16667,7309,800,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,1576,937,3814,29892,4969,2319,12286,393,508,10784,29890,701,278,10090,773,364,8013,339,1338,29892,338,385,8031,2969,29889,450,25657,3913,263,1539,481,2015,310,773,8087,2234,304,28475,1009,1298,29892,607,338,263,907,1230,982,304,5649,278,1889,29889,2398,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,4902,373,920,1438,12286,723,740,322,2020,896,723,367,11828,297,3966,21430,278,2646,262,310,15409,29889,13,13,1576,1473,3814,29892,4969,12286,393,508,297,1564,311,763,282,601,1912,29892,338,884,385,8031,2969,29889,450,25657,18568,393,1438,12286,508,1371,4883,23432,290,1144,304,6159,916,1638,550,322,2693,727,29889,2398,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,4902,373,920,1438,12286,723,367,2221,304,297,1564,311,278,3573,322,2020,896,723,367,9150,297,3415,9382,278,8475,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,907,1230,7014,29892,1009,2980,1033,14169,515,901,10757,322,16667,7309,800,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,322,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":65408948635,"load_duration":228242,"prompt_eval_count":331,"prompt_eval_duration":30119127000,"eval_count":287,"eval_duration":35289043000}
