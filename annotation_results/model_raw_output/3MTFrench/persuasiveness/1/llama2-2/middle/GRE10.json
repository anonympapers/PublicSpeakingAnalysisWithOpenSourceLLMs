{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T14:06:34.811025288Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and emphasizes their points through repetition, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker mentions the importance of defining values and how it is not an easy task, but they do not provide any concrete examples or evidence to support their claims. Additionally, the speaker's argument that the political control mechanism within the EU is flawed due to the lack of a single judge to oversee member states' actions lacks specificity and concrete examples.\n\nWhile the speaker raises some valid points about the limitations of the EU's political control mechanism, their arguments could be strengthened by providing more concrete evidence and examples to support their claims. A higher score would be warranted if the speaker were able to provide more rigorous reasoning and evidence to back up their arguments.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,1437,4951,381,553,1437,4951,2187,2298,782,11387,1136,575,2491,316,7015,451,1080,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,782,19696,371,16772,9139,316,521,562,348,553,2852,271,18490,29892,3503,5695,782,18848,868,3623,479,4797,1465,966,6361,1041,712,1444,286,29915,18949,4637,29892,634,782,18848,868,3623,479,17611,264,29889,1551,18331,2298,782,11387,11469,553,1437,4951,2187,316,269,29915,5753,434,1540,553,20368,1295,29892,14864,966,3300,861,553,266,2249,19669,29892,274,29915,342,2331,2258,21873,29892,1661,29892,6836,18331,29889,1551,18331,818,1597,18768,1139,21394,2298,7930,457,1509,29889,951,4313,12161,1465,301,29915,13094,18165,484,29899,2719,29889,1706,487,1924,332,29892,1661,29889,10050,29892,610,346,712,782,13003,316,9073,1970,8837,818,443,3623,479,29892,373,263,5246,1970,8837,782,17284,553,2852,271,18490,1671,4313,30069,1358,373,623,1808,29871,4277,454,4313,12161,11398,29889,16932,1841,348,19047,1465,1597,6815,2930,10491,634,11797,766,296,818,274,29915,14386,818,301,29915,8284,818,425,1702,391,1103,1318,966,20368,1295,316,301,29915,13094,29889,7867,29874,29892,8997,29871,29929,17478,29892,425,1248,9599,263,3984,818,301,29915,442,8356,316,9378,275,296,553,1644,13116,316,8740,267,29892,610,346,439,29915,2719,452,3928,6381,993,2331,782,9982,333,1064,271,271,868,19397,427,2058,29892,966,15306,4110,3435,1841,348,275,29892,373,263,3984,553,1067,2518,30019,787,29158,4999,29892,10440,11387,270,29915,2467,1671,301,29915,326,351,4983,29892,610,346,712,29892,2257,343,263,553,289,2029,1179,13487,19669,29889,3872,29883,1444,592,26099,6309,29892,1444,325,1759,3686,2747,18097,6701,316,5814,5893,270,29915,14559,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,19310,7093,1009,3291,1549,21159,654,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,26649,278,13500,310,16184,1819,322,920,372,338,451,385,4780,3414,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,6455,470,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,8604,2761,13336,2629,278,19007,338,17422,8734,2861,304,278,10225,310,263,2323,16833,304,975,4149,4509,5922,29915,8820,425,4684,2702,537,322,18387,6455,29889,13,13,8809,488,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,278,27028,310,278,19007,29915,29879,8604,2761,13336,29892,1009,6273,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,18387,10757,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,319,6133,8158,723,367,1370,29878,9714,565,278,25657,892,2221,304,3867,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,1250,701,1009,6273,29889],"total_duration":95035339311,"load_duration":261945,"prompt_eval_count":337,"prompt_eval_duration":30734502000,"eval_count":206,"eval_duration":64300002000}
