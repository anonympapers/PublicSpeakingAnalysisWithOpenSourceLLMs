{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T09:04:01.56692822Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score the speech as a 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as metaphors (e.g., \"l'Eustre d'une perne\" and \"la main-non\") and contrasts to drive home their points about the complexity of the experience and how it cannot be reduced to a single criterion for evaluation. The speaker also uses repetition (e.g., \"le plus d√©licat\") to emphasize their key message.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speech could be improved. For instance, the speaker could have provided more concrete examples or evidence to support their claims about the adaptability of the experience and its inability to be reduced to a single evaluation criteria. Additionally, the speaker could have clarified their main argument or thesis statement more clearly, which would have made the speech more coherent and easier to follow.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-written and effectively conveys the speaker's message, there is room for improvement in terms of providing more supporting evidence and a clearer structure.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,301,29915,29923,504,276,270,29915,1540,639,484,29889,315,29915,342,2331,23422,15093,9565,1506,453,424,1750,707,270,30095,818,301,29915,524,575,2131,316,301,29915,273,398,5289,1841,1579,17192,347,29889,315,29915,342,5695,301,29915,4582,433,6094,16555,610,966,12814,267,270,29915,524,575,2131,2123,10440,425,2723,2131,2535,22025,425,639,484,2143,20200,1487,12471,17239,29889,1720,21668,5695,16133,29539,301,29915,333,1318,4771,29892,425,2600,13469,332,316,425,1841,16041,291,29892,966,285,22730,316,4082,29884,29892,5646,29871,4277,29892,21181,712,1671,454,301,5402,29892,21181,712,1671,443,20536,3994,1908,270,29915,29948,4387,362,29889,8748,1671,29873,424,29892,454,2298,1437,506,271,452,409,302,29915,342,2331,425,639,484,29889,951,2298,1437,506,271,29892,454,2298,4280,29872,818,623,5606,29882,1581,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,735,546,29889,2866,336,19211,818,425,4933,29892,301,29915,735,546,346,269,29915,29874,7744,29948,5469,29880,944,782,378,29149,316,534,275,29889,6340,707,6635,2445,7661,20423,8532,1197,29948,2535,2257,378,29149,29889,1954,351,17856,610,17488,29892,439,29915,265,7890,26427,316,3581,12416,443,29871,29896,29900,29900,286,29892,425,1667,29899,5464,29889,8748,439,29915,265,7890,17792,427,12134,6635,2445,3842,610,4356,276,270,29915,279,3511,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,263,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,1539,12451,943,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,29880,29915,29923,504,276,270,29915,1540,639,484,29908,322,376,433,1667,29899,5464,1159,322,12814,29879,304,7899,3271,1009,3291,1048,278,13644,310,278,7271,322,920,372,2609,367,12212,304,263,2323,28770,291,363,17983,29889,450,25657,884,3913,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,280,2298,1437,506,271,1159,304,19310,675,1009,1820,2643,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,18387,6455,470,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,7744,3097,310,278,7271,322,967,297,3097,304,367,12212,304,263,2323,17983,16614,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,7542,2164,1009,1667,2980,470,266,6656,3229,901,9436,29892,607,723,505,1754,278,12032,901,16165,261,296,322,6775,304,1101,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,1532,29899,17625,322,17583,378,345,952,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,29892,727,338,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,13138,901,20382,10757,322,263,26135,3829,29889],"total_duration":116134459863,"load_duration":323477,"prompt_eval_count":266,"prompt_eval_duration":28912138000,"eval_count":250,"eval_duration":87221394000}
