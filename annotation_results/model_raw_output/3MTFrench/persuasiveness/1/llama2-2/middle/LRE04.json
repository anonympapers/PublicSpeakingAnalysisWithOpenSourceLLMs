{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T07:42:52.006046644Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The speaker raises a crucial issue in France, highlighting the poor living conditions and unsanitary environment in the country, particularly in rural areas. This is an important aspect of the speech that resonates with the audience.\n2. The speaker uses specific statistics to support their claim, such as the fact that 74% of births in France occur at home and the lack of proper medical care for mothers and children. These numbers help to build a strong argument for the need of improvement.\n3. The speaker also mentions the history of modern midwifery and how it has evolved over time, which provides a useful context for understanding the current state of affairs in France.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The speaker's argument could be strengthened by providing more detailed examples of how the situation has improved in other countries or regions, as well as specific proposals for how to address the issues in France. This would help to create a clearer roadmap for improvement.\n2. While the speaker acknowledges that progress has been made in some areas, they do not provide enough evidence to support this claim, leaving the audience with a sense of uncertainty about whether any real improvements have been made.\n3. The speaker's use of language could be more engaging and persuasive. At times, the speech feels dry and factual, lacking the emotional appeal that could help to resonate with the audience on a deeper level.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling arguments and statistics, there are areas where the speech could be improved to make it more convincing and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,553,760,4110,7691,29892,3503,966,5855,316,6316,3435,7175,1113,2658,634,425,6434,9753,9407,707,7175,16770,1647,29889,853,289,10126,29948,1190,29871,29953,29892,302,29915,27601,2331,301,29915,29282,270,29915,348,385,29889,29871,29955,29946,29995,274,29915,342,454,260,7293,553,4771,818,2432,25123,634,325,2386,993,443,2560,5419,316,269,1179,19452,1671,301,29915,24031,316,301,29915,26917,29889,8407,439,29915,1540,18085,2131,782,2757,553,29550,790,4110,13457,4285,29892,553,4439,328,583,28056,5475,1750,454,992,993,4963,942,3805,3665,8105,743,634,443,767,802,4100,316,6351,29876,1379,316,20877,29948,29889,11948,373,8164,818,7006,553,626,15817,272,800,29889,11948,427,29871,29896,29929,29946,29929,29892,29871,29896,29929,29946,29953,29892,29871,29896,29929,29929,29900,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,1750,263,1874,29948,23068,818,1750,3440,29973,8748,6079,1671,25497,276,818,7015,5155,29892,260,1379,14954,454,419,344,553,260,1647,5400,267,29892,1444,286,8146,1601,22085,9061,29889,2581,325,1759,818,425,26186,316,577,647,3794,18934,316,4224,5128,12416,1465,7594,29188,634,316,7594,26722,2257,3435,626,15817,272,743,7015,2600,10964,26269,316,425,14177,344,1055,9948,634,17887,427,3444,29889,2581,12033,1759,8648,21188,3709,425,26722,4555,782,9587,316,301,29915,13624,4625,29378,27478,966,13698,634,966,544,19669,1998,424,818,2504,283,7869,425,20877,29948,316,425,21428,634,316,301,29915,23578,424,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,5015,1477,29879,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,1153,4637,263,7618,1455,2228,297,3444,29892,12141,292,278,6460,8471,5855,322,9644,273,277,653,5177,297,278,4234,29892,10734,297,17692,10161,29889,910,338,385,4100,9565,310,278,12032,393,27396,1078,411,278,20026,29889,13,29906,29889,450,25657,3913,2702,13964,304,2304,1009,5995,29892,1316,408,278,2114,393,29871,29955,29946,29995,310,12060,29879,297,3444,6403,472,3271,322,278,10225,310,1571,16083,2562,363,25550,414,322,4344,29889,4525,3694,1371,304,2048,263,4549,2980,363,278,817,310,20414,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,884,26649,278,4955,310,5400,7145,29893,361,708,322,920,372,756,15220,1490,975,931,29892,607,8128,263,5407,3030,363,8004,278,1857,2106,310,19469,297,3444,29889,13,13,4806,557,2264,267,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,13173,6455,310,920,278,6434,756,16710,297,916,10916,470,12786,29892,408,1532,408,2702,9551,1338,363,920,304,3211,278,5626,297,3444,29889,910,723,1371,304,1653,263,26135,6520,1958,363,20414,29889,13,29906,29889,5806,278,25657,24084,2710,393,6728,756,1063,1754,297,777,10161,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29892,10124,278,20026,411,263,4060,310,25812,1048,3692,738,1855,28473,505,1063,1754,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,1033,367,901,3033,6751,322,20408,294,573,29889,2180,3064,29892,278,12032,23880,15589,322,2114,950,29892,10225,292,278,23023,1848,25530,393,1033,1371,304,27396,403,411,278,20026,373,263,25871,3233,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,752,7807,6273,322,13964,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,322,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":184262340012,"load_duration":269469,"prompt_eval_count":288,"prompt_eval_duration":30345818000,"eval_count":394,"eval_duration":153913466000}
