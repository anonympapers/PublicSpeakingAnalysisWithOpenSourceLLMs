Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker seems to be trying to convince the audience that their method of filtering water using polyons is more effective than traditional methods. However, the speech lacks concrete evidence or data to support these claims. The speaker mostly relies on their own anecdotes and hypothetical scenarios, which may not be persuasive enough for the audience. A stronger argument could have been made by providing examples of successful applications of this method or citing scientific studies that back up the claims.\n\nRigor of reasoning: The speaker's arguments are largely based on logical deductions and hypothetical scenarios, but there is a lack of rigorous mathematical or scientific reasoning. The concept of \"polyons\" is not well-defined, and the speaker does not provide any details on how these materials work or how they can be optimized for filtration. This lack of detail makes it difficult to evaluate the speaker's claims with regard to their scientific validity.\n\nOverall, while the speaker seems to have a clear vision of their method and its potential benefits, the speech could benefit from more evidence and rigorous reasoning to make a stronger persuasive argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,425,316,29835,29889,2664,4497,5582,1295,1190,7015,1667,29879,409,3435,2329,2406,1190,425,7101,553,13149,15806,29889,8748,1354,373,269,29915,314,1509,818,11549,261,301,29915,24031,553,14751,30019,787,1671,712,18402,26744,1750,2637,18342,296,1597,2284,9874,26722,634,18475,441,296,966,1667,29879,26138,29889,8748,6079,29871,4277,2257,712,1444,16623,1465,611,266,17449,29889,11948,1671,19601,29892,454,5112,1759,553,330,6048,29892,274,29915,342,1597,29835,316,1045,568,1465,22025,2257,452,3435,2331,966,18554,1750,18342,296,29889,11948,316,301,29915,14531,29892,634,12866,5278,1045,568,452,3435,2331,553,17184,2285,712,301,29915,265,2058,29892,3503,553,1775,4894,2993,977,509,1934,29889,751,392,301,29915,14531,18342,296,782,6958,553,7015,1775,4894,2993,29892,966,15680,787,325,609,269,29915,29891,17977,495,5646,4191,966,26695,316,437,335,1372,29889,8748,818,425,26558,29892,301,29915,14531,640,29875,25404,11387,316,15680,1372,29889,4241,841,424,29892,3440,373,946,663,7015,1775,4894,2993,977,509,1934,29889,8407,756,538,29892,29871,1654,432,29915,264,1539,29879,1597,29892,29871,1654,432,29915,264,1539,29879,2331,29892,634,29871,1654,432,29915,264,1539,29879,4239,29889,6803,1671,24416,274,29915,342,6079,712,1661,29892,980,452,21668,1597,15378,545,8774,386,356,29889,315,29915,342,2257,1190,439,7768,1444,6427,8284,1465,611,266,17449,29889,10793,8774,386,356,274,29915,342,301,29915,20640,4371,2246,20015,29889,8748,29871,4277,432,29915,1794,316,11549,261,966,1667,29879,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,2831,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,2444,304,367,1811,304,7602,1239,278,20026,393,1009,1158,310,21166,4094,773,15680,787,338,901,11828,1135,13807,3519,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,450,25657,11149,337,3687,373,1009,1914,385,687,29881,4769,322,13752,300,936,21846,29892,607,1122,451,367,20408,294,573,3307,363,278,20026,29889,319,23505,2980,1033,505,1063,1754,491,13138,6455,310,9150,8324,310,445,1158,470,7537,292,16021,11898,393,1250,701,278,16726,29889,13,13,29934,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,6273,526,18425,2729,373,16667,21049,1953,322,13752,300,936,21846,29892,541,727,338,263,10225,310,12912,20657,19475,470,16021,24481,29889,450,6964,310,376,22678,787,29908,338,451,1532,29899,12119,29892,322,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,1438,17279,664,470,920,896,508,367,27545,363,977,509,362,29889,910,10225,310,9493,3732,372,5189,304,14707,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,411,4880,304,1009,16021,2854,537,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,2444,304,505,263,2821,18551,310,1009,1158,322,967,7037,23633,29892,278,12032,1033,14169,515,901,10757,322,12912,20657,24481,304,1207,263,23505,20408,294,573,2980,29889],"total_duration":132168577217,"load_duration":255366,"prompt_eval_count":303,"prompt_eval_duration":32332776000,"eval_count":280,"eval_duration":99834825000}
