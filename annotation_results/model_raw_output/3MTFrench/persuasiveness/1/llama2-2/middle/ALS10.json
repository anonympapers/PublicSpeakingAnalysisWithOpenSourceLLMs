{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T08:16:03.171861842Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker does present some valid points and reasoning, but there are also some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios helps to engage the audience and make their points more relatable. For example, the line \"Je ne sais pas comment rentrer. Je ne sais plus comment partir\" creates a sense of empathy and curiosity in the listener, making them more invested in the speaker's argument.\n\nHowever, there are also some instances where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the claim that \"il y a deux médecins du vêtant\" (there are two doctors who wear traditional clothing) is not adequately supported by evidence or examples. The speaker could benefit from providing more specific details or case studies to bolster their argument.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of repetition and emphasis can sometimes feel a bit heavy-handed, which may detract from the overall impact of their message. For example, the line \"ma thèse porte sur les volitions des transmissions de ça\" (my thesis is about the intentions of these transmissions) is repeated multiple times throughout the speech, which could be seen as redundant or overly emphasized.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speaker's argument could be strengthened, the transcript provides a clear and engaging presentation of their ideas. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects a moderate level of persuasiveness, with room for improvement in terms of rigorous reasoning and effective use of rhetorical devices.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,323,29915,294,443,7006,2923,25123,29889,2581,592,3669,1403,575,29889,2581,325,1759,427,269,29915,264,5227,2496,818,425,14931,270,29915,348,5720,11505,29892,18097,2331,316,1841,1713,29889,853,14857,5720,11505,21714,29892,274,29915,342,454,6309,29892,3856,29892,427,5246,29892,454,3184,295,980,21668,23990,2872,439,7768,29889,1720,21668,2331,5227,2496,29889,435,29915,1131,295,275,1465,425,2723,275,457,1832,4379,29892,12134,11878,1883,592,4880,296,270,29915,348,4799,1006,9102,7289,29889,1551,286,29915,562,13300,371,1436,6311,29892,373,592,3348,1249,2298,14322,833,275,29892,2298,373,592,364,1947,533,29889,2581,452,872,275,2331,3440,23990,2872,29889,2581,452,872,275,2298,3440,8019,29889,11948,1436,6311,29892,1444,26099,2331,20957,29884,818,9364,276,1465,5278,11449,1465,22025,980,343,263,4239,25974,1144,868,325,11992,424,29889,1720,343,263,443,19528,5059,361,1750,707,544,15819,29892,1597,25974,457,316,6267,11399,868,325,11992,424,29889,8748,274,29915,342,29871,4277,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,29889,315,29915,342,4239,25974,1144,544,19669,1465,6267,18234,634,4079,6267,10283,293,1166,818,2967,316,715,3794,29892,782,13295,11797,4625,1035,2093,29889,8748,611,266,17449,14931,1190,966,1700,2187,553,18750,6847,316,29871,4277,1190,2257,1750,1735,2637,425,544,15819,316,343,263,521,347,29892,454,15732,707,316,302,29915,264,29890,5059,361,29889,3872,29883,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,1444,14111,29973,2581,14111,427,5246,29892,427,285,681,631,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,2854,3291,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,13752,300,936,21846,6911,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,1009,3291,901,1104,17219,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,1196,376,13836,452,872,275,2331,3440,23990,2872,29889,2581,452,872,275,2298,3440,8019,29908,10017,263,4060,310,953,2084,29891,322,27742,297,278,13254,29892,3907,963,901,2437,2868,297,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,8871,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,5995,393,376,309,343,263,4239,25974,1144,868,325,11992,424,29908,313,12711,526,1023,437,14359,1058,19531,13807,1067,6046,29897,338,451,19967,339,2486,6969,491,10757,470,6455,29889,450,25657,1033,14169,515,13138,901,2702,4902,470,1206,11898,304,15772,2475,1009,2980,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,21159,654,322,19310,275,508,6041,4459,263,2586,9416,29899,3179,287,29892,607,1122,1439,1461,515,278,12463,10879,310,1009,2643,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,1196,376,655,266,17449,14931,1190,966,1700,2187,553,18750,6847,316,29871,4277,29908,313,1357,266,6656,338,1048,278,7609,1080,310,1438,18750,6847,29897,338,10324,2999,3064,10106,278,12032,29892,607,1033,367,3595,408,28005,470,975,368,19310,1891,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29892,278,1301,924,8128,263,2821,322,3033,6751,24329,310,1009,7014,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,263,17768,403,3233,310,20408,294,20193,29892,411,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,12912,20657,24481,322,11828,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,29889],"total_duration":74854145734,"load_duration":160355,"prompt_eval_count":302,"prompt_eval_duration":27491441000,"eval_count":385,"eval_duration":47362069000}
