{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T02:34:10.689290969Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and evidence to support their claims, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that the speaker provides specific examples and studies to back up their claims. For instance, they mention that the first step in the treatment involves using a particular compound called hi-aluronide, which is found in many cosmetics, to camouflage the cancerous cells. They also explain how they have created a micro-eponge using this compound and fibre ring from the silk of worms, which allows the cancerous cells to penetrate deeper into the tissue. These details help to build credibility and make the speaker's proposal seem more plausible.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker does not provide a clear explanation of how they plan to address the issue of the degradation of the hi-aluronide compound over time. They simply mention that it will \"ressemble au maximum au cerveau,\" which is not a sufficient explanation for how this will address the problem. Additionally, the speaker does not provide any data or studies to support their claim that the use of fibre ring from the silk of worms will allow the cancerous cells to penetrate deeper into the tissue.\n\nOverall, while there are some strengths to the speech, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by more evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,5147,345,585,16530,20564,263,3663,361,29892,712,6836,425,521,381,2007,347,29892,6836,425,17937,327,29948,2390,347,29892,6836,425,521,10233,327,29948,2390,347,29892,452,20423,904,2576,4983,13162,23855,882,29889,997,8861,904,941,412,263,4370,1437,8205,473,1318,425,3829,316,2257,2930,15532,29889,405,681,325,5059,787,439,29915,2719,577,993,3949,265,1579,743,29892,980,16374,12866,18475,1590,1358,782,7472,782,5147,345,585,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,28643,872,5541,1647,15963,29892,425,274,680,7251,29899,284,332,265,1387,29889,478,681,4078,29920,2257,5541,29948,712,301,29915,265,5663,6223,760,449,1465,966,2181,19503,27973,1893,3783,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,409,1437,5105,434,325,568,29889,1720,21668,439,29915,309,18062,9378,275,10460,1472,27761,1465,454,5147,345,585,1671,425,29415,5695,301,29915,6905,488,8714,316,29542,2872,1465,454,2930,15532,29889,2581,301,29915,1794,12866,286,3610,574,29948,818,316,425,18755,276,9228,434,316,577,275,29892,27666,610,966,1147,3417,577,275,29892,634,1444,966,7468,28643,1671,9484,261,1597,9200,29899,29948,1112,479,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,443,1775,4894,585,330,265,1579,29948,1867,29892,2535,553,16169,29892,19172,424,782,3038,352,23900,1509,29892,553,26520,18949,743,29889,997,18768,904,941,412,29892,1465,966,301,29915,370,2015,362,270,29915,331,1631,30000,2710,29892,274,29915,342,6079,269,30095,29878,270,29915,25378,443,623,271,29889,2726,22299,427,1601,509,261,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,8128,2702,6455,322,11898,304,1250,701,1009,16726,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,3585,393,278,937,4331,297,278,14502,20789,773,263,3153,752,618,2000,7251,29899,284,332,265,680,29892,607,338,1476,297,1784,6776,2527,1199,29892,304,3949,283,1579,482,278,23900,681,9101,29889,2688,884,5649,920,896,505,2825,263,9200,29899,1022,265,479,773,445,752,618,322,18755,276,9228,515,278,4047,29895,310,281,555,29879,29892,607,6511,278,23900,681,9101,304,6584,300,10492,25871,964,278,260,15118,29889,4525,4902,1371,304,2048,6625,4127,322,1207,278,25657,29915,29879,24963,2833,901,2174,375,1821,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,8252,310,920,896,3814,304,3211,278,2228,310,278,316,5105,362,310,278,7251,29899,284,332,265,680,752,618,975,931,29889,2688,3763,3585,393,372,674,376,1253,6967,782,7472,782,5147,345,585,1699,607,338,451,263,8002,8252,363,920,445,674,3211,278,1108,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,848,470,11898,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,671,310,18755,276,9228,515,278,4047,29895,310,281,555,29879,674,2758,278,23900,681,9101,304,6584,300,10492,25871,964,278,260,15118,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,9324,29879,304,278,12032,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,901,10757,29889],"total_duration":162994183080,"load_duration":278368,"prompt_eval_count":307,"prompt_eval_duration":33403976000,"eval_count":356,"eval_duration":129589315000}
