{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T11:41:37.031045113Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker presents some interesting ideas and arguments regarding the use of abattoir waste as a source of valuable compounds, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that the volume of abattoir waste in France is equivalent to 7,000 blue balloons is an interesting way to visualize the scale of the problem. However, without any data or evidence to support this claim, it remains a vague and unconvincing argument. A more rigorous approach would be to provide actual numbers and statistics on the volume of abattoir waste generated in France each year.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker's idea of using abattoir waste as a source of valuable compounds is intriguing, there are some unaddressed questions regarding the feasibility and practicality of this approach. For example, what specific compounds can be extracted from abattoir waste that have actual value? How would these compounds be extracted and processed in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner? These questions remain unanswered in the transcript provided.\n\nFinally, while the speaker's use of analogies and metaphors (e.g., comparing the foie to Pac-Man) is an effective way to engage the audience and make complex ideas more accessible, it does not necessarily contribute to a rigorous or persuasive argument. A more convincing approach would be to provide more concrete examples and data to support the speaker's claims.\n\nOverall, while there are some interesting ideas presented in the transcript, the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by evidence. A score of 3 out of 5 is a reasonable evaluation of the speech's persuasiveness based on the provided transcript.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,782,18480,29892,818,12471,29871,29896,29900,29900,4679,359,29889,8748,818,18836,316,29871,29906,29900,14746,316,16169,818,8957,29884,610,385,427,3444,29892,1444,28078,11818,5152,1908,966,3408,29879,1577,8396,29892,1444,7890,263,680,443,7006,29889,315,3100,904,339,4243,782,772,4841,316,29871,29955,29871,29900,29900,29900,6411,433,1475,10767,1041,29889,315,29915,342,427,5246,553,18167,316,1437,305,1691,818,1020,1524,302,29915,342,29899,346,2331,1577,405,681,2906,787,946,381,634,534,8885,316,10984,2993,19966,575,1671,12036,261,966,5614,3518,3246,18934,316,1841,700,533,301,29915,331,558,1657,904,21553,1387,634,9484,261,316,425,20368,332,29889,315,29915,342,2257,818,439,7768,1444,325,1759,286,29915,524,1064,16136,1465,611,19696,371,1577,2598,1203,361,29892,274,29915,342,316,534,8885,316,26957,992,583,316,16497,4371,553,633,1446,316,2011,267,29892,4191,454,7446,3712,29892,425,364,10870,29892,454,274,16581,2123,10440,454,1701,347,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,325,1759,286,29915,524,1064,16136,1465,301,29915,29948,29392,316,6062,29948,21337,1750,4625,553,1801,1691,289,25747,29888,3783,1671,301,29915,562,1760,634,3165,9874,29889,2581,325,1759,1518,492,7808,29889,349,1267,424,21285,301,29915,735,331,552,868,1701,347,29889,6803,3669,29894,759,316,2257,18308,2535,966,13568,30069,4467,634,454,17887,10814,21708,17222,29892,9790,29899,2517,29889,8748,6079,14034,29920,443,14426,712,454,1701,347,316,301,29915,25403,454,1302,305,265,1750,364,4070,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,6273,11211,278,671,310,633,16234,381,19863,408,263,2752,310,21114,752,3885,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,278,7977,310,633,16234,381,19863,297,3444,338,7126,304,29871,29955,29892,29900,29900,29900,7254,6411,417,787,338,385,8031,982,304,7604,675,278,6287,310,278,1108,29889,2398,29892,1728,738,848,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29892,372,9242,263,25160,322,443,535,3845,3277,2980,29889,319,901,12912,20657,2948,723,367,304,3867,3935,3694,322,13964,373,278,7977,310,633,16234,381,19863,5759,297,3444,1269,1629,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2969,310,773,633,16234,381,19863,408,263,2752,310,21114,752,3885,338,11158,5526,292,29892,727,526,777,443,7328,287,5155,11211,278,28326,4127,322,15031,537,310,445,2948,29889,1152,1342,29892,825,2702,752,3885,508,367,23892,515,633,16234,381,19863,393,505,3935,995,29973,1128,723,1438,752,3885,367,23892,322,19356,297,263,3438,29899,15987,573,322,5177,635,19780,8214,29973,4525,5155,3933,443,12011,287,297,278,1301,924,4944,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,15690,583,322,1539,12451,943,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,17420,278,1701,347,304,9790,29899,2517,29897,338,385,11828,982,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,4280,7014,901,15579,29892,372,947,451,12695,29126,304,263,12912,20657,470,20408,294,573,2980,29889,319,901,17953,3277,2948,723,367,304,3867,901,18387,6455,322,848,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,8031,7014,9132,297,278,1301,924,29892,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,10757,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,338,263,15590,17983,310,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,2729,373,278,4944,1301,924,29889],"total_duration":248048192869,"load_duration":325833,"prompt_eval_count":303,"prompt_eval_duration":41259828000,"eval_count":406,"eval_duration":206787376000}
