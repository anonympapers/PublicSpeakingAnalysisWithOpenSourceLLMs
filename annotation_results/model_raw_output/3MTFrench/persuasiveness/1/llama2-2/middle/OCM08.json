{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T06:16:47.329600118Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points and arguments to support their claim, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker provides some interesting statistics about the number of articles published in 2020 and the impact it has on the commercial activities of businesses. However, they do not provide any concrete evidence or studies to support their claim that this tactical measure will facilitate the implantation of businesses on the African continent and favor their growth and competitiveness.\n\nMoreover, the speaker's argument that the measure will help businesses \"plant their feet\" on the continent is not very persuasive. While it is true that having a physical presence in a country can provide opportunities for growth and expansion, it is also important to consider other factors such as market conditions, regulatory environment, and competition.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's tone comes across as somewhat dismissive of the concerns of other stakeholders, such as local businesses and communities. They do not provide any concrete examples or case studies to support their argument that this measure will be beneficial for all parties involved.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some valid points, the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported by evidence. A score of 3 out of 5 is a neutral assessment, indicating that the speech could be more persuasive with additional information and analysis to support the claim.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,343,263,325,336,2073,316,439,7768,409,1539,2484,427,784,1908,29889,1704,29892,301,29915,627,29872,270,29915,348,1444,7890,610,280,29892,302,29915,342,443,20744,5541,29948,712,316,29871,29929,29871,29906,29900,29906,29900,7456,29889,29871,29929,29871,29906,29900,29906,29900,5879,277,3012,1387,1671,6367,533,634,2894,11728,301,29915,11236,2131,553,5374,28141,12128,270,29915,348,29871,29906,29892,29946,29906,29900,634,443,3300,861,16530,475,29889,1105,277,29892,29871,29906,29892,29955,29955,29906,14746,316,1136,3011,14075,29892,10890,9667,275,29892,2298,316,29871,29906,29945,29995,316,425,4665,3001,316,301,29915,3470,522,29872,383,747,344,29899,21972,819,29889,319,16474,29892,286,29915,342,29899,29881,550,316,4883,274,13805,29892,270,29915,348,4883,410,27499,316,23520,29892,432,29915,1794,1597,1139,29889,438,1481,29892,432,29915,1794,286,29915,524,1064,404,29948,1671,4048,6390,634,7199,9030,1354,2257,28476,29872,260,1808,439,29915,309,409,16474,707,443,29188,316,16089,1524,301,29915,13699,424,362,316,325,359,23440,4637,1190,454,25523,263,1341,293,475,634,427,6701,11172,7853,7608,6267,8182,9948,8288,712,6267,25732,24858,29892,425,18551,23497,20110,29889,435,29915,1794,11878,1601,26427,29889,6101,2257,28476,29872,260,1808,439,29915,309,409,3516,25404,29892,707,443,29188,316,325,359,17459,800,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,322,6273,304,2304,1009,5995,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,8128,777,8031,13964,1048,278,1353,310,7456,6369,297,29871,29906,29900,29906,29900,322,278,10879,372,756,373,278,12128,14188,310,5381,267,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,11898,304,2304,1009,5995,393,445,28476,936,5645,674,16089,10388,278,13374,424,362,310,5381,267,373,278,11715,25523,322,7853,1009,14321,322,5100,277,20193,29889,13,13,20761,957,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,5645,674,1371,5381,267,376,24389,1009,6900,29908,373,278,25523,338,451,1407,20408,294,573,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,2534,263,9128,10122,297,263,4234,508,3867,28602,1907,363,14321,322,13184,29892,372,338,884,4100,304,2050,916,13879,1316,408,9999,5855,29892,24378,7606,5177,29892,322,13888,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,5304,4822,408,10579,18918,573,310,278,21838,310,916,380,1296,8948,414,29892,1316,408,1887,5381,267,322,23507,29889,2688,437,451,3867,738,18387,6455,470,1206,11898,304,2304,1009,2980,393,445,5645,674,367,7795,5611,363,599,13973,9701,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,29892,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,338,263,21104,24809,358,29892,23941,393,278,12032,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,411,5684,2472,322,7418,304,2304,278,5995,29889],"total_duration":73451167873,"load_duration":257543,"prompt_eval_count":267,"prompt_eval_duration":27686649000,"eval_count":333,"eval_duration":45763760000}
