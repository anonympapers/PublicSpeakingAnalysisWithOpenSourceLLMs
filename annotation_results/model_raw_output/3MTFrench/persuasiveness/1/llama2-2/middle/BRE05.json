{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T02:45:25.15694771Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness in this speech. The speaker does provide some convincing arguments and examples to support their claim that they can influence the evolution of species through their behavior, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of vivid imagery and relatable analogies to help the audience understand the concept of species evolution. For example, the speaker's analogy of comparing the bacteria in Bob's stomach to a \"very small puissance\" is effective in illustrating the idea that even small changes in an individual's behavior can have significant impacts on the species as a whole.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by scientific evidence. For example, the claim that the speaker can \"modify our choices\" through their behavior is not entirely clear, and it would be helpful to provide more detail on how this modification occurs. Additionally, the speaker's assertion that they can \"influence the evolution of species\" could benefit from more explanation and evidence to support this claim.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some persuasive elements, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by scientific evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,282,6223,29920,13787,2265,966,904,4068,29879,553,5152,17893,427,4464,634,9073,6267,20299,882,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,432,29915,264,6282,484,301,29915,25375,5411,427,409,1261,3825,427,439,7768,966,289,627,4894,1912,8556,1029,1080,2535,7991,7890,282,6223,29920,878,3709,7814,3060,861,20196,7147,29889,315,29915,342,4191,1354,1444,7890,766,1759,712,7890,289,627,406,29920,938,342,979,7890,282,6223,29920,3060,275,381,1671,7890,29892,1354,7890,7175,3666,15749,286,4600,28185,9373,443,10814,1886,557,2123,316,425,4497,1943,29889,6803,7991,29892,274,29915,14386,10019,1693,29889,7991,634,19601,29892,373,7905,553,11825,1750,23997,301,29915,4582,29884,1190,868,9577,1652,29889,315,29915,14386,5278,715,1647,29899,27048,634,2331,1597,14857,29889,11948,10814,29892,8556,5646,818,1487,29892,980,343,7905,443,25698,5000,316,260,8284,1465,5278,298,6844,29889,7991,634,19601,29892,373,7905,966,286,30037,4467,5016,5365,4769,29889,29871,30219,29874,7890,966,6309,439,29915,309,343,7905,443,26379,3669,455,610,346,712,1671,1243,261,966,2258,1169,270,29915,1540,289,627,4745,29892,980,21668,19397,5734,261,443,2653,790,1617,1750,263,1597,289,627,4745,634,443,2653,790,1617,1750,302,29915,264,263,2331,29889,317,4987,439,29915,265,302,29915,14386,2331,9577,10329,566,1671,11113,276,443,289,627,4745,29889,1551,452,269,29915,9864,277,2331,2257,712,29871,4277,3911,5246,29889,11948,10814,29892,285,9864,277,443,24792,5218,29889,3872,29883,373,263,19493,29948,818,425,28776,29899,29873,29899,29873,29899,309,29892,10814,29892,29871,4277,263,11878,454,9667,424,29892,432,29915,1794,639,700,29889,8396,29889,5334,17103,29892,454,11619,273,263,3686,388,29948,316,592,364,465,9945,29889,315,29915,342,1597,22577,282,4582,545,29889,5879,568,282,4582,545,29892,472,841,311,29920,29889,6803,7890,12450,5893,818,26814,260,8284,29892,274,29915,342,4191,1354,373,263,454,7890,11658,29948,1465,454,3248,29889,10016,904,3820,434,316,425,260,8284,316,26814,1298,18097,6701,29889,8396,29892,432,29915,6698,1759,269,30095,29878,29892,29871,4277,269,29915,342,6079,1209,29948,29889,1720,286,29915,29874,11658,29948,553,3677,747,24414,3783,29889,435,29915,1794,639,700,5646,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,297,445,12032,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,17953,3277,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,393,896,508,9949,278,14675,310,6606,1549,1009,6030,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,1104,17219,15690,583,304,1371,278,20026,2274,278,6964,310,6606,14675,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,3483,6933,310,17420,278,289,5761,423,297,7991,29915,29879,380,290,496,304,263,376,1201,2319,2653,9948,29908,338,11828,297,8632,1218,278,2969,393,1584,2319,3620,297,385,5375,29915,29879,6030,508,505,7282,10879,29879,373,278,6606,408,263,3353,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,16021,10757,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,5995,393,278,25657,508,376,1545,1598,1749,19995,29908,1549,1009,6030,338,451,9186,2821,29892,322,372,723,367,8444,304,3867,901,9493,373,920,445,21733,10008,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,896,508,376,13453,29884,663,278,14675,310,6606,29908,1033,14169,515,901,8252,322,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,756,777,20408,294,573,3161,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,16021,10757,29889],"total_duration":149946149365,"load_duration":286872,"prompt_eval_count":443,"prompt_eval_duration":48797629000,"eval_count":285,"eval_duration":101147536000}
