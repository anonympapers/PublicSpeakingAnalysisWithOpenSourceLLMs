The speaker presents some valid points about France's strategic location and resources, but their reasoning is not entirely rigorous and lacks depth in some areas. Here are some specific reasons why:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: The speaker mentions that France has a \"énorme territoire marrant\" (enormous marine territory) and \"ses îles possèles le droit souffrent\" (its islands have the right to suffer), but provides no concrete evidence to support these claims.\n2. Oversimplification: The speaker simplistically states that France is strategically located on the Mediterranean, Middle East, Asia, Africa, and America, without acknowledging the complex geopolitical dynamics at play in each region.\n3. Lack of nuance: The speaker's argument that France's small size makes it insignificant is not entirely accurate. While France may not have the same military or economic might as some other countries, it still has a significant cultural and diplomatic impact on the global stage.\n4. Unclear thesis statement: The speaker mentions that they will \"mesure avec des indicateurs sociopolitiques\" (measure with social and political indicators) to support their argument, but it is unclear what specific indicators they are referring to or how they will be used to support the thesis.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid points about France's strategic location and resources, their reasoning could benefit from more depth and nuance to make a stronger case.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,1671,339,7768,425,3444,6303,454,17793,29948,427,633,295,4625,28353,1465,966,904,862,267,1577,8748,6079,14875,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,11172,712,274,29915,342,17887,766,29899,29876,29915,7308,2131,439,29915,524,29948,23458,966,2852,1446,29892,3503,6267,904,12324,29872,22922,1766,21867,29889,951,332,578,1487,8261,424,772,17387,634,6267,5898,29899,2929,2143,5218,7167,1318,868,12642,634,868,611,277,1467,29892,1750,3119,14785,3999,2961,793,3119,30000,793,454,17950,3669,600,7771,29892,270,29915,24516,12418,634,270,29915,4548,417,7018,316,3999,18475,2863,29889,897,2298,29892,20554,3435,26742,2445,8105,882,2174,29883,2406,1190,966,281,2736,29879,1766,1475,297,521,381,5271,29892,454,2730,11771,29899,12236,29948,29892,634,301,29915,2887,347,29892,818,301,29915,29909,24361,634,818,301,29915,6833,20600,29889,11948,1671,339,7768,707,29899,346,439,29915,265,427,7945,316,16263,9945,3999,24571,29894,690,26943,2535,5278,298,6844,634,1597,9577,286,585,1564,895,527,7018,316,14875,315,14899,1577,8748,6079,14875,634,17375,29886,29899,3373,9854,29892,274,29915,342,610,346,712,7015,5697,3246,2961,793,3435,782,274,16581,316,611,266,17449,29889,28266,7732,6063,29899,29890,30057,484,29899,29876,574,29892,1444,29188,2535,553,12266,1295,5374,13242,277,3783,29892,301,29915,5215,749,316,3999,2961,793,1465,425,26742,2445,347,1766,347,316,260,28114,29920,29899,300,29899,30001,29899,20146,634,6267,10879,1465,966,5302,13487,19669,29889,1174,270,29915,14559,1840,267,29892,818,439,7768,29871,4277,8556,724,29873,316,8556,8957,276,1671,7015,5697,1169,3209,11878,639,1372,868,22591,316,301,29915,542,29948,273,634,439,29915,342,2257,712,2257,302,29915,342,8556,623,10069,1577,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,3444,29915,29879,16650,293,4423,322,7788,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,9186,12912,20657,322,425,4684,10809,297,777,10161,29889,2266,526,777,2702,9590,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,26649,393,3444,756,263,376,1690,555,29872,22922,1766,21867,29908,313,264,555,681,23585,20123,29897,322,376,29879,267,2961,793,3119,30000,793,454,17950,3669,600,7771,29908,313,1169,24191,505,278,1492,304,8812,511,541,8128,694,18387,10757,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,13,29906,29889,438,874,13699,2450,29901,450,25657,5466,391,1711,5922,393,3444,338,16650,1711,5982,373,278,25620,10800,273,29892,14253,6932,29892,14325,29892,10557,29892,322,6813,29892,1728,24084,3460,278,4280,1737,13242,277,936,19753,472,1708,297,1269,5120,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,4948,749,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,3444,29915,29879,2319,2159,3732,372,1663,647,928,424,338,451,9186,16232,29889,5806,3444,1122,451,505,278,1021,9121,470,17407,1795,408,777,916,10916,29892,372,1603,756,263,7282,16375,322,13487,2454,10879,373,278,5534,7408,29889,13,29946,29889,853,8551,266,6656,3229,29901,450,25657,26649,393,896,674,376,4467,545,2535,553,12266,1295,5374,13242,277,3783,29908,313,26658,411,5264,322,8604,4221,4097,29897,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,541,372,338,20871,825,2702,4221,4097,896,526,16811,304,470,920,896,674,367,1304,304,2304,278,266,6656,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,3444,29915,29879,16650,293,4423,322,7788,29892,1009,24481,1033,14169,515,901,10809,322,4948,749,304,1207,263,23505,1206,29889],"total_duration":166288838456,"load_duration":264760,"prompt_eval_count":343,"prompt_eval_duration":36050842000,"eval_count":353,"eval_duration":130237095000}
