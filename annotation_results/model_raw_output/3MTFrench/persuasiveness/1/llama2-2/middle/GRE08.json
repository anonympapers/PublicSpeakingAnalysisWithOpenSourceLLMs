{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T13:40:17.791588434Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker demonstrates some understanding of the topic by acknowledging the potential of antibodies as therapeutic agents, citing their ability to recognize and eliminate diseased cells while preserving healthy cells. However, they also mention that the structure of these molecules is crucial for their activity, which suggests a lack of depth in their understanding of the subject matter.\n2. The speaker's use of analogies, such as comparing antibodies to \"chercheur chiens\" and \"molybdène et de la sœur engue,\" is creative but ultimately confusing and distracting from the main point. These analogies do not add clarity or depth to the speaker's argument and may confuse listeners who are not familiar with the terms used.\n3. The speaker's emphasis on the importance of interfaces, without providing sufficient explanation or evidence, feels somewhat arbitrary and does not contribute meaningfully to the overall message.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some potential in their understanding of antibodies as therapeutic agents, their lack of depth in their analysis and tendency towards confusing analogies detract from their ability to present a convincing argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,610,346,712,18097,373,966,263,1597,21753,29892,980,24722,7848,15390,316,25238,13639,966,3038,2540,4439,3076,1465,24145,14913,29892,610,17488,29892,553,3038,2540,5178,2719,14652,267,634,966,904,2576,4983,5646,427,7175,2140,424,966,3038,2540,269,22702,29889,315,29915,342,12866,553,10283,293,20060,2535,443,9577,5162,3104,296,709,29892,439,29915,4999,3435,9577,6366,3302,2535,9577,7006,553,16449,553,474,4201,793,29889,11948,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,21668,16134,381,6267,3829,2069,4379,29889,6803,592,7199,9030,2257,6964,29892,1444,325,1759,592,1841,3666,261,316,10984,2993,325,583,427,16464,818,443,385,29889,6101,1444,11504,10646,610,17488,29892,443,14954,1173,332,521,819,29892,1444,26099,443,14954,1173,332,521,819,29892,20737,24145,1006,29882,3121,545,707,5161,802,270,29915,5474,1209,519,358,9982,279,1100,24697,29889,8748,427,2298,29892,373,2947,11113,276,454,4771,316,24145,16549,29889,8748,1671,966,3677,293,272,567,29892,274,29915,342,9541,309,29889,6101,373,11113,425,3829,2069,4379,316,425,6062,29948,1810,484,29892,373,11113,1487,5039,2131,29889,2581,592,10484,276,2298,16530,20564,1190,966,19510,29889,10016,5067,29892,29871,4277,2947,1437,2576,1524,29871,29906,2316,13805,1750,452,409,286,3610,927,2331,29889,422,1004,610,17488,29892,425,1650,3677,293,272,567,1750,707,270,29915,8284,1295,2730,533,634,454,12796,270,29915,1540,269,16581,3033,434,29889,8407,19666,316,7015,19510,29892,966,3677,293,272,567,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,9004,1078,777,8004,310,278,11261,491,24084,3460,278,7037,310,3677,747,397,583,408,266,1572,412,329,293,19518,29892,7537,292,1009,11509,304,18720,322,27399,10267,1463,9101,1550,2225,29530,9045,29891,9101,29889,2398,29892,896,884,3585,393,278,3829,310,1438,13206,21337,338,7618,1455,363,1009,6354,29892,607,14661,263,10225,310,10809,297,1009,8004,310,278,4967,4383,29889,13,29906,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,671,310,15690,583,29892,1316,408,17420,3677,747,397,583,304,376,4630,1173,332,521,11689,29908,322,376,29885,18333,6448,8146,634,316,425,269,16581,3033,434,1699,338,907,1230,541,18973,16051,322,1320,1461,292,515,278,1667,1298,29889,4525,15690,583,437,451,788,7542,537,470,10809,304,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,322,1122,1970,1509,11621,414,1058,526,451,9985,411,278,4958,1304,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,19310,275,373,278,13500,310,19510,29892,1728,13138,8002,8252,470,10757,29892,23880,10579,11472,322,947,451,29126,6593,3730,304,278,12463,2643,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,7037,297,1009,8004,310,3677,747,397,583,408,266,1572,412,329,293,19518,29892,1009,10225,310,10809,297,1009,7418,322,260,5197,7113,16051,15690,583,1439,1461,515,1009,11509,304,2198,263,17953,3277,2980,29889],"total_duration":130259272474,"load_duration":262805,"prompt_eval_count":300,"prompt_eval_duration":26833945000,"eval_count":302,"eval_duration":103424468000}
