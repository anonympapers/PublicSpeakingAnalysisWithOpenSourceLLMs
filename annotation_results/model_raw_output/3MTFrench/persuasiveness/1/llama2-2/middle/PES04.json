{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T05:22:41.362852907Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points about the impact of economic socialism on the economy, but their reasoning is not always rigorous and their arguments could be strengthened with more detailed evidence and logical connectives.\n\nThe speaker mentions that there is a trade agreement between Australia and France that resulted in the creation of 40% of the jobs in the French economy, which suggests that economic socialism may have had a positive impact on job growth. However, the speaker does not provide any context or evidence to support this claim, making it difficult to evaluate its validity.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument that economic socialism leads to a reduction in GDP could be strengthened by providing more specific data and analysis on the topic. For example, they could have discussed how other countries with similar economic systems have performed economically or provided historical examples of how economic socialism has affected GDP growth.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid points about the impact of economic socialism, their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported to make a stronger case for their argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,553,1437,1182,275,29892,443,12111,1564,993,966,904,700,29883,532,2658,29889,1174,16132,29892,5278,904,700,29883,532,2658,1863,296,29892,1444,534,8885,1794,425,11896,2637,966,23837,347,5264,267,634,966,904,700,29883,3780,267,29889,853,1775,262,882,1671,339,7768,454,4599,347,5264,29892,980,343,263,818,19601,29892,6303,1804,29948,427,15017,2637,301,29915,22537,347,634,966,3444,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,425,18187,362,316,9411,5898,29899,29885,2749,424,1750,1283,276,2665,296,7209,7930,417,347,1190,553,8595,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,4029,11710,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,1750,409,21714,29973,1720,286,29915,29874,6309,439,29915,309,343,263,1597,23837,347,1750,27435,2947,1671,1487,553,7930,371,29899,12974,267,5264,267,29892,1750,707,14344,29899,27048,27219,533,1249,1465,29871,29946,29900,29995,818,443,1841,700,428,316,402,2736,29889,9353,454,27666,10996,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,818,301,29915,18704,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,10879,310,17407,5264,1608,373,278,26504,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,322,1009,6273,1033,367,9324,6419,411,901,13173,10757,322,16667,4511,3145,29889,13,13,1576,25657,26649,393,727,338,263,11302,17327,1546,8314,322,3444,393,20601,297,278,11265,310,29871,29946,29900,29995,310,278,17643,297,278,5176,26504,29892,607,14661,393,17407,5264,1608,1122,505,750,263,6374,10879,373,4982,14321,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,3030,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29892,3907,372,5189,304,14707,967,2854,537,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,17407,5264,1608,11981,304,263,20376,297,402,11191,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,2702,848,322,7418,373,278,11261,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,15648,920,916,10916,411,2788,17407,6757,505,8560,7766,1711,470,4944,15839,6455,310,920,17407,5264,1608,756,15201,402,11191,14321,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,278,10879,310,17407,5264,1608,29892,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,304,1207,263,23505,1206,363,1009,2980,29889],"total_duration":121468543670,"load_duration":213856,"prompt_eval_count":197,"prompt_eval_duration":21814688000,"eval_count":255,"eval_duration":99653091000}
