The speaker presents some valid points about the importance of regulation in the mining industry and the need to protect the environment. However, the reasoning presented is not always rigorous and could benefit from more detailed evidence and logical arguments.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions the need for a \"m√©thode efficace\" to make the invisible visible, but does not provide any specific examples or data to support this claim. Similarly, while the speaker acknowledges the potential impact of mining on the environment, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the potential effects or propose any specific solutions to mitigate these impacts.\n\nAdditionally, some of the arguments presented are based on simplistic and unproven assumptions, such as the idea that \"les terrar\" are mysterious and costly. While it is true that mining can have significant environmental impacts, it is not clear why these impacts would be any more significant than those associated with other human activities.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some important points about the need for regulation in the mining industry, the reasoning presented could benefit from more detail and rigor.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1671,427,4805,533,553,1375,6947,1314,4191,454,11872,1974,29892,454,15499,2123,966,1935,13678,29889,838,943,980,8556,21668,316,15378,545,6367,944,362,1671,410,6772,914,2257,2778,345,1924,1314,3503,1354,16624,4745,1314,634,3438,391,22702,29889,405,681,1029,787,3008,28230,270,29915,1540,8774,386,356,6366,815,1671,7697,276,7962,301,29915,262,12872,316,7814,633,4637,634,19397,904,791,2853,301,29915,6574,627,316,7814,5039,7719,1465,5278,19859,1750,8556,1702,13871,269,29915,309,2123,14029,634,1750,707,1671,29873,424,1354,410,1173,316,8556,29889,18375,654,9139,944,3440,16623,787,29899,29876,681,29973,382,29882,6079,427,8556,16500,553,26893,29892,553,16283,29892,553,3031,13116,29892,992,533,553,17478,782,20710,1883,4338,818,4880,261,2637,966,13830,409,1849,1671,904,3090,914,5278,22577,289,9061,29889,8748,980,343,427,263,5644,568,332,29892,553,1644,13116,29892,553,3533,4285,610,772,647,743,316,330,912,359,29889,2726,14979,23435,553,5614,2406,29892,553,302,2249,14075,29892,553,1248,8105,21158,29892,634,6701,553,11364,4481,3076,29892,7015,2894,1608,267,4805,536,1099,2658,1750,6896,9696,818,14984,966,5855,316,3165,680,29892,6701,818,14344,316,301,29915,267,3535,29889,951,25698,5000,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,1072,2785,297,278,1375,292,13661,322,278,817,304,12566,278,5177,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,9132,338,451,2337,12912,20657,322,1033,14169,515,901,13173,10757,322,16667,6273,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,278,817,363,263,376,12031,386,356,6366,815,29908,304,1207,278,27597,7962,29892,541,947,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,2304,445,5995,29889,20175,29892,1550,278,25657,24084,2710,278,7037,10879,310,1375,292,373,278,5177,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,13173,7418,310,278,7037,9545,470,16193,738,2702,6851,304,1380,335,403,1438,10879,29879,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,777,310,278,6273,9132,526,2729,373,5466,4695,322,443,771,854,20813,29892,1316,408,278,2969,393,376,793,1935,13678,29908,526,22277,2738,322,3438,368,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,1375,292,508,505,7282,29380,10879,29879,29892,372,338,451,2821,2020,1438,10879,29879,723,367,738,901,7282,1135,1906,6942,411,916,5199,14188,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,4100,3291,1048,278,817,363,1072,2785,297,278,1375,292,13661,29892,278,24481,9132,1033,14169,515,901,9493,322,12912,272,29889],"total_duration":62972085769,"load_duration":192539,"prompt_eval_count":252,"prompt_eval_duration":26626091000,"eval_count":267,"eval_duration":36345205000}
