The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, but could benefit from more depth and rigor in their reasoning.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of explaining the concept of cellular aging and how it is influenced by both internal and external factors. They use analogies to help illustrate their points, such as comparing the cell to a city and the different organs within it to different buildings. However, they could have gone more in-depth into the scientific mechanisms behind these processes, which would have made their argument more convincing.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While they mention that they have a candidate IPR2, they do not explain what this means or how it relates to cellular aging. Providing more specific examples and data to support their arguments would have made the speech more persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear argument, they could benefit from more depth and rigor in their reasoning and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,23719,1039,29892,373,263,4224,23048,712,454,6316,453,11537,302,29915,14386,2331,868,20498,882,818,24145,12471,17239,29892,3503,439,29915,309,6303,28580,768,1465,7814,410,4569,410,29887,22702,29892,24145,26138,594,29882,8146,29892,634,274,29915,342,818,2257,3256,425,7175,3476,712,432,29915,1639,29894,993,5075,1318,316,611,1999,1709,634,26154,316,639,30019,5903,29948,11115,29892,18934,316,7199,9030,439,29915,1808,330,8146,8164,6079,6367,8584,454,6316,453,11537,316,7814,3038,2540,29892,634,425,289,7293,15217,29892,274,29915,342,712,432,29915,1794,443,7105,271,5641,29934,29906,29892,634,274,29915,342,19601,7890,1518,492,7808,1487,17889,782,2757,316,425,3038,1297,29889,1720,21668,6079,7199,9030,712,425,3038,1297,707,782,4768,1189,2488,29892,2257,712,425,8441,707,818,301,29915,25006,2488,29889,16579,802,19951,29892,707,1597,385,18165,17239,4280,29872,3503,540,545,14735,1318,29889,13915,2535,19601,1465,425,3038,1297,8441,712,432,29915,1794,2852,4749,29948,782,13911,333,819,29889,2664,19389,3435,17667,1465,29871,1654,29892,2257,316,1775,5289,270,29915,262,689,800,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,6803,274,29915,342,6267,17899,29948,2258,21873,29892,14034,29920,454,8442,12128,610,25659,29892,443,269,2795,29875,10042,316,301,29915,264,23581,295,29889,29871,30219,29874,343,707,29892,7890,29871,22730,1465,611,3038,1297,8441,29892,9577,6079,16134,424,1601,371,29920,2535,19601,1465,611,6283,568,9200,29899,6078,29892,712,1444,7890,427,1539,29879,1465,454,18062,316,425,3038,1297,8441,29892,18934,316,7199,9030,3440,454,7006,6316,453,381,29889,6298,26814,26003,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,22944,29892,427,10767,29884,29892,301,29915,314,20600,29892,4875,694,29891,1249,782,27678,316,301,29915,21708,332,594,29882,8146,29892,27510,316,14984,966,1437,3476,1080,782,2757,316,425,3038,1297,29889,853,7006,2298,658,262,29892,1190,26814,29262,29892,425,10135,14090,1841,29873,12906,1647,29892,4875,409,8323,316,425,14710,17449,553,5541,2406,29889,1174,5246,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,2298,658,262,1190,425,26003,29892,7890,16391,29920,425,14710,17449,29892,4875,2485,568,782,16731,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,1033,14169,515,901,10809,322,12912,272,297,1009,24481,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,24232,278,6964,310,3038,1070,946,292,322,920,372,338,28482,491,1716,7463,322,7029,13879,29889,2688,671,15690,583,304,1371,28475,1009,3291,29892,1316,408,17420,278,3038,304,263,4272,322,278,1422,1638,550,2629,372,304,1422,13814,29889,2398,29892,896,1033,505,7695,901,297,29899,19488,964,278,16021,7208,12903,5742,1438,10174,29892,607,723,505,1754,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,505,263,14020,5641,29934,29906,29892,896,437,451,5649,825,445,2794,470,920,372,1104,1078,304,3038,1070,946,292,29889,9133,4821,901,2702,6455,322,848,304,2304,1009,6273,723,505,1754,278,12032,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,2980,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,10809,322,12912,272,297,1009,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":128591626542,"load_duration":236625,"prompt_eval_count":421,"prompt_eval_duration":43393626000,"eval_count":244,"eval_duration":85197212000}
