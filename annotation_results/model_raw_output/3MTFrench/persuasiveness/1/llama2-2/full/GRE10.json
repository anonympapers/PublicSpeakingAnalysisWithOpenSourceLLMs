{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T13:31:56.447413036Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively presents their argument and uses examples to support their claims, but there are some areas where they could improve.\n\nFirstly, the speaker provides a clear and concise definition of democracy and state of law, which is helpful in understanding their argument. They also offer alternatives to the current system, such as cutting funding for states that do not respect EU values, which shows that they have thought critically about the issue.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve. For example, at times, their arguments feel a bit disjointed and it can be difficult to follow their train of thought. Additionally, some of their examples feel a bit simplistic and do not fully address the complexity of the issue.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling arguments, there are areas where they could improve in terms of clarity and depth of analysis.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,30219,29874,5246,7890,325,336,2073,2257,712,274,29915,342,712,425,16158,16909,347,1671,301,29915,28323,316,17950,29889,2581,29758,439,29915,2719,20715,29880,21017,29889,12390,1437,29876,2209,1080,752,1461,3783,9411,966,16283,3503,1671,4048,6390,2257,712,274,29915,342,1841,295,944,29892,29871,4277,15210,21394,2298,1437,506,271,29889,9353,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,373,263,443,4274,1750,6309,712,301,29915,19986,707,6299,1318,1190,553,20368,1295,4555,24145,16158,16909,347,707,24145,2852,271,316,17950,29889,751,392,373,263,3984,427,2058,15093,4274,29892,373,269,29915,342,6309,1354,18413,980,343,263,553,2852,271,4110,1750,3390,296,2331,966,20368,1295,29892,373,2947,11469,301,29915,1466,868,282,680,29889,8748,301,29915,19986,29211,2947,11113,276,427,2181,2487,13017,2131,20110,29889,1551,263,24889,29948,1597,1650,427,626,347,427,2058,553,8774,3068,1608,267,316,4313,12161,29892,454,27965,1314,1616,1387,29871,29955,260,29899,29872,1314,29889,4546,29875,1601,1203,361,1465,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,1354,432,29915,852,2970,316,4313,30069,1358,454,4313,12161,2123,868,11387,316,966,20368,1295,29889,6803,409,9073,5646,270,29915,24430,29892,432,29915,1794,17134,301,29915,711,4026,868,4313,12161,29889,751,392,373,610,280,316,16158,16909,347,29892,610,17488,373,302,29915,29874,2331,9411,966,286,30037,4467,26192,29889,951,17284,427,17950,2947,707,4193,712,425,16158,16909,347,274,29915,342,7848,904,6092,29889,8748,1597,10098,712,7890,29871,22730,904,6092,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,9073,4963,942,5646,2257,712,7890,28078,11867,29889,3872,29883,1671,1437,4951,381,553,1437,4951,2187,2298,782,11387,1136,575,2491,316,7015,451,1080,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,3479,1426,267,16772,29876,1379,316,521,562,348,553,2852,271,1860,29892,3503,5695,782,18848,868,3623,479,4797,1465,966,6361,1041,712,1444,286,29915,18949,4637,29892,634,782,18848,868,3623,479,17611,264,29889,1551,18331,2298,782,11387,11469,553,1437,4951,2187,316,269,29915,5753,28031,316,553,20368,1295,29892,14864,966,3300,861,553,266,2249,19669,29892,274,29915,342,2331,2258,21873,29892,1661,29892,6836,18331,29889,1551,18331,818,1597,18768,1139,21394,2298,7930,457,1509,29889,951,4313,12161,1465,301,29915,13094,18165,484,29899,29873,29899,309,29889,24674,29891,29899,20519,29889,10050,29889,10050,610,346,712,782,13003,316,9073,1970,8837,818,443,3623,479,29892,373,263,5246,1970,8837,782,17284,553,2852,271,1860,1671,4313,30069,1358,373,623,1808,29871,4277,454,4313,12161,11398,29889,1720,409,1841,348,5582,1465,1597,6815,2930,10491,634,980,6309,818,15093,4698,737,818,425,18520,634,1224,316,301,29915,13094,29889,7867,29874,29889,28266,29871,29929,17478,29892,425,282,13835,263,3984,818,301,29915,442,9577,270,29915,20205,553,1644,13116,316,8740,267,29892,610,346,439,29915,309,452,3928,1249,2331,3479,9982,333,1064,271,1446,868,19397,427,2058,29889,2664,15306,4110,3435,1841,348,275,29889,1551,263,3984,553,1067,2518,30019,787,29158,4999,427,14913,11387,270,29915,2467,1671,301,29915,326,351,4983,29892,610,346,712,29892,274,29915,342,443,1437,29890,2029,482,13487,15819,29889,3872,29883,1444,592,26099,6309,29892,1444,325,1759,3686,2747,316,5814,5893,4239,29892,7732,27809,29889,365,29915,13094,1436,749,553,410,27499,1465,521,562,348,553,2852,1446,18490,29889,6803,339,7768,452,2331,3581,546,454,696,915,29899,262,29899,3470,262,749,1671,966,2852,1446,18490,1750,452,3390,10978,2331,966,20368,1295,316,301,29915,13094,29973,2581,16193,553,27809,29889,365,29915,524,1064,11992,1671,8556,427,11172,712,274,2049,11771,707,904,12324,29872,29889,315,29915,342,316,4048,6390,6722,8556,599,787,29889,365,29915,524,1064,11992,1671,301,29915,13094,29211,707,8648,29403,29889,1459,346,439,29915,30001,1601,4771,29892,454,26379,25698,5000,316,301,29915,13094,29211,29892,274,29915,342,2331,454,5826,29916,277,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,513,2593,1064,663,553,274,2049,29891,575,29889,1551,454,24722,2535,966,27254,17611,9387,1750,269,29915,9961,305,296,634,1750,452,302,29915,351,568,2331,363,29883,15471,966,285,681,29889,10793,15373,29892,274,29915,342,553,10419,800,15237,427,629,275,29889,8748,11797,427,623,1808,818,1597,12784,9577,2560,29889,315,29915,342,818,301,29915,
