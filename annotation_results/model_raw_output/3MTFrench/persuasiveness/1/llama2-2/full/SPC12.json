{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T00:03:38.078336284Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech in terms of crafting a convincing message and rigorous reasoning. The speaker does an excellent job of presenting their case by using clear and concise language, providing concrete examples to illustrate their points, and addressing potential counterarguments.\n\nThe speaker's use of rhetorical questions (e.g., \"Est-ce que vous pouvez lever la main si vous avez déjà consulté un médecin ?\") and hypothetical scenarios (e.g., \"Suppose you come back 4 years later with a new problem, will the doctor remember what they prescribed last time?\") helps to engage the audience and build credibility for their argument. Additionally, the speaker's emphasis on the potential impact of their work (\"... when I'm able to do this, I could define different types of profiles based on pathologies and treatments, and then easily orient new patients towards the most suitable treatments.\") highlights the practical applications of their research and the potential benefits for patients.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the speaker could improve their persuasiveness:\n\n1. Provide more specific examples: While the speaker provides some concrete examples, they could benefit from more detailed and specific cases to illustrate the potential impact of their work. This would help to make their argument more convincing and tangible for the audience.\n2. Address potential objections: The speaker does a good job of addressing potential counterarguments, but could further develop these points to provide even more thorough responses to common criticisms. This would help to strengthen their argument and build additional credibility with the audience.\n3. Show enthusiasm and passion: While the speaker presents their case in a clear and logical manner, they could benefit from showing more enthusiasm and passion for their work. This would help to engage the audience and make their message more compelling.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,11797,5697,1169,3435,270,29915,1175,29915,17073,267,29889,2661,29899,346,712,7890,282,6223,29920,26610,425,1667,1354,7890,8992,29920,20737,27883,443,25974,262,1577,478,681,452,4078,29920,8164,29899,5474,2331,29892,3503,818,2257,3256,29899,27048,29892,11797,4625,19694,443,13659,10283,936,1190,7890,29889,8748,1601,18848,1136,2488,818,1841,5231,29539,7015,19313,1671,13304,782,6628,1314,454,3105,332,1020,17334,4555,7890,7890,1841,18809,424,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,25974,457,15001,5711,1318,29889,1720,6025,344,25915,29892,1601,1203,361,316,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,17789,582,533,26814,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,461,1444,286,29915,29891,544,1975,1577,9353,301,29915,29882,30069,29886,2410,6722,1444,6427,8284,29892,8556,1029,787,544,29145,316,325,19680,6063,270,29915,19678,10283,28148,10961,29948,4555,544,29145,316,29871,29896,29900,14746,316,13659,29879,10283,293,2993,29892,9953,743,2535,19601,1465,454,2432,9874,868,4802,848,29889,6803,16455,643,7015,21880,29892,1444,966,1933,895,427,316,13830,5216,7545,29892,966,21880,2281,332,2406,634,966,21880,1661,2281,332,2406,29889,6803,966,21880,2281,332,2406,29892,2257,3435,553,19313,1027,2701,29892,13547,712,454,2245,868,10283,936,286,29915,331,558,275,2123,966,1801,1691,1473,7147,18475,296,993,610,454,16500,29889,12390,19313,3435,2258,21873,818,16455,643,1559,20554,3435,10961,2406,1465,427,1591,585,29889,853,337,3703,1173,1671,966,21880,1661,2281,332,2406,409,3435,966,13659,29879,10283,293,2993,29889,8748,274,29915,342,301,29915,627,29872,2123,2257,752,492,17851,29889,12660,16627,980,343,263,10741,4072,316,13659,29879,29892,553,1235,5888,29892,553,4313,392,375,316,521,381,2007,347,2123,316,521,12387,2123,10440,553,4356,3409,2925,316,12409,29889,11948,7015,1426,267,640,23510,553,19313,13499,262,5326,13547,712,966,13752,30000,6609,868,25974,262,1190,454,16500,2123,10440,966,2635,25766,553,3483,952,267,439,29915,309,263,1014,29875,29889,6803,16455,643,7015,1426,267,29892,1444,325,1759,3667,7608,553,3093,3751,4467,712,432,29915,932,514,1572,29875,2123,260,1169,29889,8748,427,22700,424,7015,714,2719,29892,1444,325,1759,316,7869,337,280,369,443,553,13830,1801,1691,316,301,29915,24209,344,316,1842,1750,378,2265,484,301,29915,1693,2450,553,289,22730,25406,7719,29889,9194,794,966,25974,1144,1750,4625,553,22069,1424,29948,16011,325,609,9073,553,5614,631,784,4237,2637,966,13659,29879,868,16500,1671,17161,261,1597,9637,316,1487,23396,10283,28148,29889,7747,1750,409,21714,610,17488,29892,7890,325,10281,14255,26814,25974,262,454,29871,29896,29945,8891,29871,29906,29900,29896,29945,634,7890,8992,29920,1597,285,1461,545,868,13137,634,1465,454,13659,454,25974,262,2947,904,699,276,29892,1444,2225,9695,29871,29941,3031,13116,316,29871,29941,3031,13116,270,29915,1131,295,29889,29871,29946,6063,2298,11364,29892,7890,20957,6096,1671,443,4439,316,330,3890,634,18916,980,2947,5614,631,784,1358,425,16549,24618,1377,29871,29946,6063,2298,260,9373,3503,7209,527,1803,276,425,2635,29889,951,25974,262,4323,7004,29871,4277,634,966,2793,634,425,1487,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,11948,454,2730,262,3503,714,309,4323,361,609,22272,2257,19696,371,29892,11797,325,609,7199,9030,712,454,25974,262,2947,1020,1524,26814,4439,316,330,3890,427,7890,977,424,297,1131,295,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,29871,4277,712,2257,16933,3058,882,9577,1411,818,659,631,29889,8748,1465,1601,714,309,29892,432,29915,1794,4021,29792,29871,4277,316,289,22730,25406,7719,29889,435,29915,1794,5246,1597,16455,344,316,7015,5614,4285,784,4237,1190,29871,29953,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1426,267,634,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,712,29871,29896,29995,316,7015,10701,16474,2406,427,289,22730,25406,7719,29889,8292,17856,818,4883,27965,1314,29871,29896,29900,14746,316,10701,29892,29871,4277,5246,16573,316,29871,29896,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1426,267,1750,3435,3104,296,18029,1098,5326,610,2257,289,1000,29889,3872,29883,274,29915,342,12866,443,6079,611,1324,332,818,23532,427,16731,7628,316,425,17789,4080,316,26814,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,10016,10098,712,1444,724,1794,15390,316,9073,29871,4277,29892,1444,1671,23469,1437,4951,381,553,20077,4072
