{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T01:33:46.266079538Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The speaker is clear and concise in their delivery, making it easy to follow their argument.\n2. They provide several examples and statistics to support their claims, which helps to build credibility and conviction.\n3. The speaker's passion for the topic is evident, which can be persuasive in itself.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. While the speaker provides some compelling arguments, they lack depth in their analysis of the topic. They primarily focus on presenting examples and statistics without fully examining the underlying causes or potential solutions.\n2. The speaker's use of language can be confusing at times, making it difficult to fully understand their point. For example, the phrase \"la Parisien\" is unclear, and it's not clear what the speaker means by \"l'entraiment.\"\n3. The speaker's argument relies heavily on correlations between exposure to pesticides and the development of certain diseases, but they do not provide a comprehensive explanation of how these exposures lead to these diseases.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling arguments, their analysis could benefit from more depth and rigor in their examination of the topic.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,712,7890,28078,11867,7890,9073,2298,11364,29892,1597,1139,13483,1671,11172,439,29915,265,2174,802,29892,712,301,29915,265,263,5646,269,29915,296,355,29884,782,11387,1597,10098,1671,270,29915,348,472,276,12491,29889,19551,802,432,29915,28899,275,2298,17222,29892,1671,286,29915,29874,1241,818,25497,276,818,5278,1139,29892,373,5178,1924,18484,316,3060,275,381,443,11510,631,712,432,29915,264,29878,30037,793,29892,712,18729,378,2974,1249,611,20877,29948,29889,6101,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,9201,427,5644,262,316,325,359,1437,1859,583,6351,29876,4999,712,432,29915,1794,2653,9073,9291,29915,30001,16474,29892,980,3031,569,1841,637,424,712,2257,27923,302,29915,29874,2002,993,2331,818,5646,427,521,562,348,29889,8748,712,301,29915,27419,316,1487,11510,631,452,17512,1875,1249,2331,427,12563,23563,8714,872,20877,29948,29889,28720,17488,29892,454,9982,351,5606,1810,371,332,18484,15935,5483,610,10713,875,307,1169,29892,11797,3435,13149,6311,427,26713,20877,29948,712,425,1841,2170,818,4665,29889,16932,285,2017,11387,29892,11797,289,692,296,2298,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,11797,269,13365,296,1841,2445,6311,439,29915,2719,577,993,2298,564,3780,267,712,270,29915,28619,3058,267,2224,11763,29889,365,29915,296,336,2073,29892,966,301,29915,23578,30069,4467,302,29915,609,316,2257,439,29915,309,343,263,29889,2726,508,22543,1274,6947,2658,1750,260,9373,12694,1237,3038,2540,316,24145,13625,15422,743,818,8556,11482,9030,8474,966,24424,29892,966,270,627,29948,2722,29889,838,943,29892,3440,29231,5495,29892,8164,29899,309,427,1579,3837,2265,6267,20877,29948,29973,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,5646,301,29915,711,4026,316,611,266,17449,29892,7199,9030,439,29915,4999,3435,966,7877,29948,1860,29892,2858,1547,13876,270,29915,13453,3837,2265,425,3681,819,2123,316,3038,267,427,285,2017,14255,966,9221,12906,371,1295,29889,2581,16623,346,712,1601,16794,316,301,29915,29948,5935,2249,347,5458,29889,16579,802,1775,262,29892,1444,592,966,427,29880,15792,425,282,866,29899,305,1908,29899,433,29899,29887,1280,29889,838,943,29892,425,8861,904,941,412,16374,1791,261,425,13773,316,12326,29889,6212,2509,29892,1354,5152,8146,7890,302,29915,29874,545,29920,2331,1671,1120,424,2970,712,282,519,29892,260,29915,264,4771,818,425,5814,2673,270,29915,1789,9948,29889,315,3100,301,29915,5753,398,2785,316,544,29145,2123,270,29915,513,1575,19172,336,316,1437,4951,381,2123,1661,29892,301,29915,562,786,348,4427,2131,270,29915,1144,375,1103,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,1354,1601,10420,296,29892,425,13773,269,29915,328,538,276,454,9122,24286,29889,8407,9587,316,6267,6316,6351,23497,29892,966,9221,12906,371,1295,4079,28374,4072,270,29915,4999,29899,29890,30057,6609,316,9257,29892,18484,966,4239,427,6701,8714,29889,8748,29892,21668,8648,5646,443,21285,316,260,30057,6609,27858,904,1707,4926,267,29889,3599,324,2167,3435,553,3778,2993,29892,8324,316,282,15931,2247,29892,610,1601,578,3123,553,282,15931,2247,29889,1720,19947,553,902,29890,293,2247,29892,553,17564,293,2247,29892,553,6299,29879,316,23921,680,29892,2298,316,286,1924,6062,29948,21337,28374,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,3008,28230,316,17043,13639,301,29915,24031,316,425,6316,6351,23497,553,9221,12906,371,1295,1671,7199,9030,782,6628,1314,1671,707,4193,634,904,791,2853,782,6628,1314,966,2258,1169,316,521,562,1540,316,7015,14060,2187,1190,425,10503,29948,1240,802,3038,267,1871,29872,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,2331,316,4933,2980,29948,454,8714,29889,838,943,29892,3440,4048,6390,1750,707,2123,263,4370,14060,29948,818,439,7768,29973,435,29915,1794,301,29915,6727,5580,316,10212,818,611,27963,29892,425,286,2249,14119,316,29871,29896,29947,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,4348,375,29889,11001,267,29231,453,296,316,16573,2123,316,658,262,1465,454,9122,818,4122,10936,29889,315,3417,344,29899,19898,634,3479,22700,800,12997,3783,29892,1444,325,1759,260,5893,316,7199,9030,439,1379,3435,966,5302,1863,1934,2637,14060,2187,634,623,2518,6847,316,425,4439,328,347,29889,997,521,979,2131,316,611,266,17449,592,26427,316,1841,29894,283,29889,4124,15470,10042,712,454,17268,452,12852,844,275,29889,438,29884,28185,9373,10042,712,425,4439,328,347,302,29915,29874,2331,1791,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,
