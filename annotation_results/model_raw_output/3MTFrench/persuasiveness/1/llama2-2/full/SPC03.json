{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T23:54:05.638477207Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions to engage the audience and make them think about their own behaviors and habits. For example, \"Et si le continue à se rite, il multiplie ses risques de maladies qui arrivent à se culer.\" This technique helps to build a connection with the audience and makes the message more relatable.\n2. The speaker provides concrete examples and data to support their argument. For instance, \"Ils ont répondu à des autocestionnaires, sur leur mode de vie, leur état de santé, leur milieu social professionnelle.\" This helps to establish credibility and make the message more persuasive.\n3. The speaker identifies a specific problem (i.e., the lack of personalized advice for quitting smoking) and proposes a solution (an application that provides personalized advice based on individual profiles). This makes the message more focused and actionable.\n4. The speaker uses a clear and concise language, which makes the message easy to understand and follow.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speech could be improved:\n\n1. The speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claims. For example, they could have cited studies or research that demonstrate the effectiveness of personalized advice for quitting smoking.\n2. The speaker could have spent more time building a rapport with the audience before launching into the main message. This would have helped to establish a sense of trust and credibility.\n3. The speech could benefit from more emotional appeal. While the speaker does use rhetorical questions, they could have done more to appeal to the audience's emotions and values. For example, they could have shared personal anecdotes or used storytelling techniques to make the message more memorable and impactful.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-structured and effectively uses rhetorical questions, it could benefit from more evidence and emotional appeal to make it more persuasive. A score of 3 out of 5 seems appropriate given these factors.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,274,29915,342,5646,26269,316,7890,29892,286,17914,360,2603,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,316,285,398,1318,29892,1444,24108,454,7980,29892,634,9411,966,7431,2310,2708,592,3669,29882,1249,296,316,286,29915,292,29539,316,285,398,1318,29889,8748,1444,24108,454,7980,818,301,29915,16063,457,10098,316,2298,29892,980,269,29915,29891,3948,9061,29892,634,274,29915,342,15237,2331,6628,1314,7980,29889,8748,1354,454,6773,818,409,364,568,29892,980,2473,572,347,3999,5161,1912,316,4439,328,583,1750,564,374,794,818,409,274,8584,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,980,263,13003,634,18679,4191,8556,9411,29871,1654,553,752,4211,267,316,7175,7316,29892,1671,3948,30037,357,316,285,398,1318,634,1671,289,692,261,2298,29889,5791,25698,5000,302,29915,342,2331,443,767,802,316,17385,362,2123,316,24792,29948,29892,782,6761,533,29889,323,681,7015,7191,3435,6836,7744,2406,818,7814,29892,270,29915,7308,4279,316,6316,452,6836,2022,5711,261,29889,997,1650,1671,8356,7848,1597,2280,316,16317,296,29948,29892,4067,1318,818,553,5446,1691,316,20877,29948,4511,2406,4191,553,16703,1973,270,29915,11236,2131,29892,1671,8556,263,1241,818,1874,261,1411,519,358,7814,4760,8192,316,6316,29889,2598,18848,316,266,17449,302,29915,342,2331,20498,882,316,9484,261,5278,2280,270,29915,562,2388,4211,882,15001,5711,1318,868,5161,802,5881,29875,586,6151,1070,29892,3503,316,7175,862,261,12563,301,29915,262,14867,12425,29892,301,29915,264,5815,30058,17239,1480,1387,29892,1750,19172,336,3479,19313,7664,11689,316,13942,29877,2496,5278,2280,29889,8748,1671,712,5278,2280,12852,6366,815,29892,980,21668,439,29915,1808,2653,5582,27516,553,5178,2719,15001,5711,743,818,18402,20077,316,5161,802,5881,29875,586,6151,1070,29889,8748,1671,19397,16219,381,7015,20077,29879,316,5161,802,29892,432,29915,4422,895,553,21880,1721,375,270,29915,1540,22085,9061,1757,1318,610,301,29915,22653,5000,29892,782,16573,316,29871,29906,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,18554,29889,16932,4625,1841,1112,700,818,553,1120,542,602,1056,2658,29892,1190,6267,4464,316,6316,29892,6267,2852,271,316,20877,29948,29892,6267,22591,5264,6351,23497,29889,8748,818,8019,316,14984,7015,21880,29892,1444,325,1759,19397,15882,553,12694,1237,20077,29879,316,5161,802,634,6787,533,553,564,16105,316,4224,2459,29889,8748,9551,261,818,301,29915,29874,680,270,29915,348,419,2131,270,29915,735,546,1372,10283,293,2993,29892,443,19607,7744,29948,818,18402,20077,29889,8748,1354,373,6664,993,818,24145,18926,29892,373,427,872,277,270,29915,485,749,270,29915,29282,1190,3911,29889,1720,5246,286,29915,6574,562,261,610,8694,29889,1720,263,553,17898,30019,787,29892,980,707,782,521,30069,29885,482,29889,360,29915,19908,1487,20077,29892,301,29915,6214,2947,3911,9551,261,553,1824,4467,15001,5711,743,1671,22964,2853,7015,2114,11620,316,5161,802,878,28677,29889,8748,1465,443,7017,8714,29892,980,2947,29892,610,17488,29892,9073,443,18766,270,29915,348,17478,7209,4434,562,29892,3503,8648,22964,2853,872,1136,3011,362,316,3038,267,29892,427,1841,700,275,424,7015,13900,21136,1379,29892,439,29915,442,276,782,269,9457,29889,8748,427,4951,29892,301,29915,29884,9551,261,553,7019,2925,270,29915,11236,2131,15001,5711,743,818,11387,316,3581,567,29889,8748,425,2186,2131,316,5278,2280,16933,439,29915,1808,12852,878,352,519,1465,454,8714,29889,8748,7847,29892,29378,2853,634,9551,261,553,1824,4467,634,553,5178,2719,427,18165,316,301,29915,29948,4068,868,20077,634,553,7175,8191,316,18402,20077,29889,8748,782,285,764,427,4951,29892,592,1190,1261,475,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,316,285,4680,29889,8748,1444,24108,454,7980,316,3516,25404,286,17914,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,432,29915,1794,3948,30037,6772,316,285,4680,634,1444,16623,868,7980,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,963,1348,1048,1009,1914,4010,18930,322,2299,1169,29889,1152,1342,29892,376,29923,29873,1354,454,6773,818,409,364,568,29892,980,2473,572,347,3999,5161,1912,316,4439,328,583,1750,564,374,794,818,409,274,8
