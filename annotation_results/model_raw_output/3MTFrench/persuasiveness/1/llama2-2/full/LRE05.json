{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T07:03:30.570624515Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The speaker is passionate about their project and clearly believes in its potential to benefit the community.\n2. They provide specific examples and data to support their claims, such as the number of inhabitants and the need for new housing.\n3. They acknowledge potential challenges and obstacles, such as the need to gather information on the population, economy, environment, and culture.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The speech lacks a clear structure or introduction, making it difficult to follow at times.\n2. The speaker relies heavily on repetition and generalizations, rather than providing specific evidence or data to support their claims.\n3. There is a lack of consideration for potential counterarguments or negative consequences of the project.\n4. The speaker does not address the concerns or objections of the audience, instead dismissing them as \"bich√®re\" (a derogatory term).\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows enthusiasm and conviction for their project, they could improve on providing more specific evidence and data to support their claims, as well as addressing potential criticisms and concerns.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,29871,29941,29900,6063,29892,8556,724,609,443,7284,270,29915,7308,15776,818,425,1841,13094,29889,11948,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,29871,4277,1735,1577,7747,302,29915,342,712,29871,29896,29945,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,12173,1462,12898,358,7147,818,301,29915,29949,29887,29948,29892,8532,439,29915,585,18997,29915,15669,29892,8556,26520,787,818,25497,276,818,425,26427,29889,315,29915,342,5695,29871,29896,29945,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,16380,1173,1462,12898,358,7147,818,302,473,12416,18097,8556,11101,7719,316,5802,3435,4046,743,634,712,8556,8556,2174,647,787,316,425,289,436,1908,29889,315,29915,342,5695,29871,29896,29945,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,10984,2993,5703,743,818,9484,261,18097,22572,29915,15669,24145,260,2993,316,521,30069,29885,482,707,410,1173,553,29871,29906,29900,13667,634,427,4951,29892,274,29915,342,29871,29896,29945,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,12173,1462,12898,358,7147,1190,7814,12049,20737,2258,568,1190,23778,29889,11948,302,29915,388,6096,2331,1236,332,29892,274,29915,342,25698,5000,316,734,282,2747,868,9122,966,4325,535,5888,634,1671,15749,966,282,898,690,29889,405,681,1029,787,11817,29948,454,15744,270,29915,348,1375,5049,521,21115,29892,1750,1136,2488,818,2894,7608,301,29915,267,3535,316,1487,9913,6430,9030,3479,3008,29877,1144,29892,270,29915,585,18997,29915,15669,634,316,1261,475,29889,2664,410,27499,270,29915,348,1375,5049,454,521,21115,29892,1750,18165,484,28185,9373,6079,29889,7747,13180,8556,1029,787,2011,29948,818,260,267,29892,712,2257,1750,1766,1173,14255,1601,5614,475,452,1766,1173,2331,363,29883,15471,14255,19601,29889,6803,339,7768,1577,1459,346,712,454,15744,270,29915,348,1375,5049,868,364,30037,345,16374,7848,7744,29948,818,1487,22922,634,274,29915,342,2257,29899,27048,1750,7697,2923,25123,425,6316,270,29915,348,626,262,482,332,818,425,1841,13094,29889,1459,2257,712,1661,23422,11797,437,27649,10420,261,818,553,410,27499,7744,743,782,378,29149,316,2739,457,29892,3503,427,2298,29892,966,11984,452,409,18475,13365,296,2331,301,29915,1540,634,301,29915,18288,634,966,5884,22297,3435,12694,1237,29202,1465,425,6701,7096,29889,838,943,19601,29892,10019,11407,29892,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,1480,261,29871,29896,29945,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,301,13544,575,29889,315,29915,342,325,17016,29892,980,592,9378,277,18916,818,1597,270,6619,457,316,260,2470,316,29871,29945,29900,29900,22609,316,22916,712,432,29915,6252,1572,29875,818,611,285,9061,29892,7847,802,8556,302,29915,485,787,2331,316,260,5793,1190,454,22922,29889,11948,29892,427,29871,29896,29900,29900,29900,29892,454,9580,2093,2535,1597,3966,2663,29892,425,784,1908,553,12173,29892,2123,10440,425,260,30057,1173,9744,351,1908,1671,966,6282,9230,29892,1444,872,275,712,1354,1444,282,1947,29920,29892,553,21426,427,25927,29948,453,482,427,904,506,3670,1908,29889,438,29884,29892,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,1671,1597,15217,5782,29889,897,6701,29892,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,302,473,12416,29871,29896,29945,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,12173,29889,315,29915,342,325,17016,29892,980,9378,3055,316,22641,261,454,24165,2123,316,7814,10984,2993,29892,634,270,29915,264,9073,1597,285,10877,9221,23249,29892,3503,18097,8556,2906,787,6003,381,966,3533,631,553,2852,4749,1934,29892,610,8474,29892,2257,712,19601,1444,1236,1314,9073,29892,274,29915,342,1437,18821,29948,1750,707,553,301,29915,9961,1173,270,29915,314,1690,5049,1750,2947,2535,1487,22922,29889,6803,18729,29892,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,270,29915,262,689,800,1190,425,4665,29892,1190,301,29915,29948,4599,347,29892,301,29915,21813,17239,29892,2123,427,378,4620,12896,634,6079,270,29915,18288,29889,2598,18848,29892,274,29915,342,316,12584,5495,2535,1601,22420,7289,1671,427,429,5435,553,14517,316,21880,634,553,10701,316,17164,6386,29892,966,19313,4555,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,29889,11948,432,29915,1794,5695,3008,28230,553,1044,11620,316,301,29915,314,1690,5049,29892,1750,3435,966,14931,1295,316,15744,29892,634,7890,29892,425,4665,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,1112,700,818,443,20710,4196,4207,16115,634,592,1040,1008,29202,9291,29915,30001,29871,29896,29882,316,26814,8714,427,2637,634,29871,29945,29889,6803,592,337,1050,261,553,20854,2234,782,13295
