{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T04:34:29.526854564Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points about the importance of social economy and its impact on the society, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claim that social economy is very important. While they mention the agreement between Australia and France, they do not provide any specific data or statistics to back up this claim. Additionally, they could have addressed potential counterarguments or objections to their argument, such as the potential for negative externalities or unintended consequences of prioritizing social economy over other economic goals.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's argument that the water crisis is caused by the lack of consideration for future generations is not fully developed. While they mention the importance of thinking about the future, they do not provide any specific examples or case studies to illustrate how this could be achieved in practice. A more detailed and nuanced explanation of this point would have strengthened the overall argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some valid points about the importance of social economy, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,966,12278,1179,14858,5059,275,29892,2971,279,634,260,30057,1912,1750,3435,1661,4991,743,4625,316,4662,280,1295,29889,2664,14979,23435,1750,269,29915,342,9577,19398,3911,634,439,29915,2719,1424,294,277,966,20542,7907,966,10890,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,966,23837,583,5374,1338,29892,966,904,4068,29879,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,29892,274,29915,342,9577,4100,29889,2664,4292,9230,634,425,15253,347,5374,1338,325,609,301,29915,5474,9577,25595,358,29889,2664,1766,23469,735,1277,10120,425,11896,1190,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,1465,454,4092,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,301,29915,11569,1690,272,882,316,796,536,1481,980,302,29915,342,2331,10814,1671,966,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,29889,2664,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,302,29915,342,2331,21394,270,29915,287,3409,29948,1671,1437,699,276,443,12471,17239,12128,7853,519,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,980,302,29915,342,2331,1950,1671,534,8885,425,11896,29889,21678,29920,29899,14167,29872,1277,10120,425,11896,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,427,2852,566,631,301,29915,10126,309,392,553,10273,29948,558,1169,634,534,8885,966,10273,293,532,2658,29889,1174,16132,29892,5278,10273,293,532,2658,1863,296,29889,2581,534,8885,1794,425,11896,2637,966,23837,583,5374,1338,634,966,904,4068,29879,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,1671,339,7768,454,23837,347,5264,29973,1720,343,263,818,19601,6303,1804,29948,427,15017,2637,301,29915,22537,347,634,966,3444,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,316,425,18187,362,316,9411,5898,29899,29885,2749,424,1750,1283,276,2665,267,7209,7930,417,347,1190,553,8595,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,4029,11710,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,1750,409,21714,29973,1720,286,29915,294,2386,993,443,23837,347,1750,27435,2947,1671,1487,553,7930,371,29899,558,1169,5374,1338,1750,707,425,27219,533,270,29915,348,29871,29946,29900,29995,427,1841,700,428,316,402,2736,29889,9353,454,27666,10996,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,443,23837,347,9577,4100,707,25732,277,361,29889,838,943,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,14531,553,7600,1750,269,29915,309,343,263,301,29915,29948,4599,347,25881,707,9577,4100,634,4625,28643,443,7048,27774,532,2658,29889,315,29915,342,818,8556,316,10420,261,818,301,29915,3496,381,634,427,27516,443,18551,1841,535,5553,631,316,1437,3511,454,23837,1387,29889,8748,274,29915,342,2331,856,315,29915,14386,1083,262,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,5264,26504,322,967,10879,373,278,12459,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,5264,26504,338,1407,4100,29889,5806,896,3585,278,17327,1546,8314,322,3444,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,848,470,13964,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,896,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,704,24247,304,1009,2980,29892,1316,408,278,7037,363,8178,7029,1907,470,443,524,2760,27721,310,7536,277,5281,5264,26504,975,916,17407,14433,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,4094,24161,338,8581,491,278,10225,310,19220,363,5434,1176,800,338,451,8072,8906,29889,5806,896,3585,278,13500,310,7291,1048,278,5434,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,1206,11898,304,28475,920,445,1033,367,14363,297,6944,29889,319,901,13173,322,4948,8362,8252,310,445,1298,723,505,9324,6419,278,12463,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,5264,26504,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":156762255028,"load_duration":283239,"prompt_eval_count":483,"prompt_eval_duration":51849917000,"eval_count":270,"eval_duration":104911398000}
