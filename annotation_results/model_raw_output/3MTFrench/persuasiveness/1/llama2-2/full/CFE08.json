{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T10:45:39.144581402Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker uses some emotional appeals to make their case, such as comparing the volume of cochon waste to that of blue whales and emphasizing the importance of reducing the ecological debt. However, they also rely heavily on logic and reason, which detracts from the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker presents some logical arguments, such as the idea that the cochon waste could be used to create new value and reduce the ecological debt. However, they also make some questionable claims, such as the suggestion that the foin (a type of feed for pigs) could be used to prevent diabetes and obesity. These claims are not supported by scientific evidence and detract from the speaker's credibility.\n\nOverall, while the speech shows some signs of rigorous reasoning and persuasive techniques, it is not without its flaws. A more convincing argument could be made with a clearer focus on the specific benefits of the proposed solution and a stronger evidence base to support those claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,6303,1597,10098,966,7732,5697,1169,1302,305,787,29889,8748,6079,2123,29875,29892,29871,29906,29900,29896,29929,29892,274,29915,342,425,5273,868,1302,305,265,29889,3872,29883,29892,24145,7732,5697,1169,1302,305,787,29892,274,29915,342,6079,425,1437,29887,2073,1465,301,29915,326,1182,261,29889,751,392,5646,270,29915,348,17103,454,8774,13775,8556,7171,311,29892,6974,29874,634,4332,332,2883,634,373,454,1302,305,265,29892,454,2298,26379,29892,454,2298,15258,634,454,2298,623,1893,654,29889,2581,325,1759,592,6367,18362,2257,10784,15819,29889,315,29915,342,454,3256,992,309,30001,29889,26219,439,29915,348,7006,2923,25123,29892,7455,283,452,767,479,2331,301,29915,524,27083,284,2131,316,966,373,793,454,1302,305,265,29889,8748,425,5582,623,332,381,425,282,681,344,29892,966,373,793,29892,966,633,1144,634,6701,425,17949,29889,478,681,4788,29920,592,2970,10440,439,29915,309,269,29915,342,3984,782,301,870,29875,7209,325,713,311,29889,8748,6079,1661,29892,5646,4191,7890,29892,14954,970,29892,7455,283,452,767,479,712,966,289,787,3036,346,1314,868,1302,305,265,29889,5202,276,358,6309,425,325,713,311,29889,8748,454,18062,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,2298,3817,15471,966,5614,3518,1169,3435,966,7019,1066,339,3794,29889,349,661,1173,15243,28313,29892,818,3256,1465,425,22259,2131,29889,1174,269,496,424,712,966,5614,3518,1169,17899,296,29892,274,29915,342,10440,1671,1644,868,772,4841,270,29915,348,1302,305,265,29889,853,1302,305,265,29892,282,17449,427,10636,265,29871,29896,29900,29900,12118,29889,8748,818,18836,316,29871,29906,29900,14746,316,1236,1295,633,1131,375,610,385,427,3444,29892,1444,7890,425,5582,9073,966,3408,29879,29889,8396,29892,1444,7890,263,680,443,7006,29889,315,3100,904,339,4243,782,772,4841,316,29871,29955,29871,29900,29900,29900,8287,22702,10767,1041,29889,29871,30219,29874,427,5246,29892,553,18167,316,1437,305,1691,818,1020,1524,302,29915,342,2331,29889,405,681,2906,787,946,381,634,534,8885,316,10984,2993,19966,575,1671,12036,261,966,5614,3518,1169,18934,316,1841,700,533,301,29915,331,558,1657,904,21553,1387,634,9484,261,425,20368,332,29889,315,29915,342,2257,818,439,7768,1444,325,1759,286,29915,524,1064,16136,1465,611,19696,371,29889,2598,1203,361,29892,274,29915,342,316,534,8885,316,26957,992,583,316,16497,4371,553,633,1446,316,1236,1295,29892,4191,454,7446,3712,29892,425,364,10870,29892,454,274,16581,2123,10440,454,1701,262,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,325,1759,286,29915,524,1064,16136,1465,301,29915,29948,29392,316,6062,29948,21337,1750,4625,553,1801,1691,289,25747,29888,3783,1671,425,20877,29948,3165,9874,29889,2581,286,29915,4548,9854,29889,349,1267,787,21285,301,29915,735,331,552,868,1701,262,29889,478,681,7890,3669,854,6096,316,2257,18308,2535,966,13568,30069,4467,634,454,17887,10814,21708,29892,9790,29899,2517,29889,8748,6079,14034,29920,443,14426,712,454,1701,262,316,301,29915,25403,454,1302,305,265,1750,364,4070,427,410,6772,457,12450,2016,425,15284,689,29872,868,18308,9790,29899,2517,29889,9790,29899,2517,3911,2947,8121,261,454,17889,868,302,4096,603,634,2947,6003,381,2181,647,17084,966,410,6772,1475,868,1701,262,29889,3387,29872,3440,286,29915,331,29885,8146,29892,409,5663,6223,302,1318,2535,443,13568,21492,634,18916,29892,402,4183,369,29892,274,29915,342,425,1436,316,425,1841,2467,427,11643,720,29948,768,347,29889,3872,29883,29892,427,11482,2344,573,818,425,1436,316,425,8691,29892,8556,8556,5663,5128,787,2535,1773,4279,316,5697,1169,3036,346,2993,316,410,6772,1475,712,9790,29899,2517,263,1841,375,1039,818,3581,546,29889,8748,7015,5697,1169,3036,346,2993,316,410,6772,1475,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,1236,415,277,634,6079,8556,1029,787,1841,375,1039,818,1437,8315,2872,439,29915,2719,23997,553,10850,28141,4768,1189,3783,818,4048,6390,427,1134,3104,296,361,634,427,1134,270,29915,29882,2249,19971,29889,838,943,29892,1750,8092,1037,443,8694,712,454,1701,262,316,301,29915,25403,454,1302,305,265,19172,8356,316,7175,15470,454,652,370,12973,316,24145,15243,15243,26805,634,6701,22964,2853,301,29915,1131,2509,316,611,3984,1509,29899,1131,911,634,2123,29875,29892,4883,29881,1280,634,4883,12991,1295,29889,405,681,452,454,25179,18949,787,18413,25235,29892,3503,14984,634,1841,295
