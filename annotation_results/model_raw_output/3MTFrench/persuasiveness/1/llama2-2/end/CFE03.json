{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T10:35:35.649864563Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a persuasive message. The speaker provides some interesting insights into the effects of stress on grain yield, but their reasoning is not always rigorous and could benefit from more detailed explanations and evidence.\n\nHere are some specific areas where the speaker could improve:\n\n1. Lack of clear definitions and explanations: Throughout the transcript, the speaker uses terms like \"variétés,\" \"conditions normales et stressées,\" and \"épies permettent carré\" without providing clear definitions or explanations. It would be helpful to provide more context and clarify these terms for the audience.\n2. Inconsistent use of evidence: The speaker provides some evidence to support their claims, such as the number of grams of grain per epi, but there are also several instances where they make claims without providing any evidence. For example, when discussing the effects of stress on grain yield, the speaker simply states that \"it makes a big difference\" without providing any data or research to support this claim.\n3. Lack of logical flow: At times, the speaker's argument feels disjointed and lacks a clear logical flow. For example, when discussing the importance of semen, the speaker abruptly switches from talking about grain yield to pilots without providing any connection between the two topics.\n4. Overuse of colloquial expressions: While the use of colloquial expressions can make a speech more engaging and relatable, the speaker overuses them in this transcript. This can distract from the main message and make it harder for the audience to follow the speaker's train of thought.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas, their reasoning could benefit from more rigorous explanation and evidence. With some improvements in these areas, the speaker could potentially increase their persuasiveness and make a stronger argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,425,2058,868,19643,358,29889,2598,18768,1203,361,29892,274,29915,342,316,1437,18821,261,3058,267,1197,7719,29892,5898,330,4211,1647,3700,818,443,22884,13180,6267,3710,790,482,316,2646,262,29892,23068,818,425,12278,4427,2131,316,260,8284,316,2646,262,29889,6803,20946,4582,283,672,29892,1444,2058,18402,1597,316,7015,1197,7719,1465,1597,4195,6056,744,634,1465,1597,4195,22884,1318,29892,1750,3928,1465,1601,3209,818,443,9122,2123,818,1597,19624,5694,19113,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,29188,1671,18402,1197,7342,634,1465,966,4239,5855,6267,5419,270,29915,6430,583,19172,296,1559,5606,634,6267,5419,316,2646,262,1702,13871,29899,29886,583,29889,1174,4951,29892,1444,2058,4348,27751,9411,966,2646,1144,553,7930,583,29889,478,681,4078,29920,4145,819,29871,4277,263,4595,904,1631,316,1999,29948,2637,29871,29906,29953,29900,29900,818,6674,4926,634,10741,3533,4285,553,8230,4769,2025,2122,29889,2581,7890,454,7090,2331,29892,29871,4277,5246,21394,270,29915,629,1144,29889,11948,10814,29892,1444,639,6899,1224,29892,1559,4191,6309,301,29915,2918,12621,787,29892,373,1841,1054,371,2257,712,301,29915,265,269,29915,29874,603,29889,838,943,29892,1354,373,18331,818,3031,261,29892,2298,13052,331,358,634,2298,3390,27751,316,24145,12471,17239,29892,14034,29920,29899,346,439,29915,265,1671,8356,1841,1054,357,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,20408,294,573,2643,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,9545,310,22884,373,2646,262,7709,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,322,1033,14169,515,901,13173,7309,800,322,10757,29889,13,13,10605,526,777,2702,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,15848,322,7309,800,29901,17044,449,278,1301,924,29892,278,25657,3913,4958,763,376,5927,28141,1699,376,1116,2187,6056,2122,634,22884,2406,1699,322,376,6430,583,19172,296,1559,5606,29908,1728,13138,2821,15848,470,7309,800,29889,739,723,367,8444,304,3867,901,3030,322,15544,1438,4958,363,278,20026,29889,13,29906,29889,512,3200,9696,671,310,10757,29901,450,25657,8128,777,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,278,1353,310,867,2232,310,2646,262,639,321,1631,29892,541,727,526,884,3196,8871,988,896,1207,16726,1728,13138,738,10757,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,5353,292,278,9545,310,22884,373,2646,262,7709,29892,278,25657,3763,5922,393,376,277,3732,263,4802,4328,29908,1728,13138,738,848,470,5925,304,2304,445,5995,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,16667,4972,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,23880,766,12090,287,322,425,4684,263,2821,16667,4972,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,5353,292,278,13500,310,3031,264,29892,278,25657,633,6685,368,4607,267,515,9963,1048,2646,262,7709,304,8230,1862,1728,13138,738,3957,1546,278,1023,23820,29889,13,29946,29889,6811,1509,310,784,417,339,616,12241,29901,5806,278,671,310,784,417,339,616,12241,508,1207,263,12032,901,3033,6751,322,1104,17219,29892,278,25657,975,6394,963,297,445,1301,924,29889,910,508,1320,1461,515,278,1667,2643,322,1207,372,22622,363,278,20026,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,29892,1009,24481,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,8252,322,10757,29889,2973,777,28473,297,1438,10161,29892,278,25657,1033,19998,7910,1009,20408,294,20193,322,1207,263,23505,2980,29889],"total_duration":183849331833,"load_duration":298963,"prompt_eval_count":268,"prompt_eval_duration":28229144000,"eval_count":421,"eval_duration":155619327000}
