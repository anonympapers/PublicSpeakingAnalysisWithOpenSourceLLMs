{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T14:53:57.114701021Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker presents their idea in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of articulating their vision for a new socio-economic model that prioritizes the well-being of workers and the organization of work. They provide specific examples of how their proposed model could benefit society, such as identifying thousands of fraudulent expenses and changing the conditions of work. However, there are some logical fallacies and unsubstantiated claims in the speaker's argument that detract from its persuasiveness.\n\nFor example, the speaker argues that their model will \"change the conditions of life at work,\" but does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker makes a blanket statement about all entrepreneurs and businesses being able to benefit from their proposed model, without acknowledging the potential challenges and limitations of implementing such a system.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a compelling vision for a new socio-economic model, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make their argument more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,24209,344,2535,19601,425,289,473,3605,276,304,29875,29892,454,22272,29871,4277,29892,1671,6787,533,1601,878,15340,29889,315,3417,344,818,5278,878,15340,29892,274,29915,342,2637,7734,29889,1720,8556,9691,29892,2947,11549,261,868,7017,714,309,29892,15390,270,29915,25378,966,10879,29879,1190,966,378,29880,29284,427,18848,634,1190,301,29915,22481,868,18848,29889,8748,1444,29758,6701,2298,658,262,1465,425,1436,381,29889,2581,29758,443,878,15340,577,3934,29899,29948,4599,1387,29892,2560,875,5818,29892,14984,966,23440,4637,1465,9411,966,5786,818,18402,29889,2726,3533,4285,316,5227,275,270,29915,1064,404,29892,15390,270,29915,25378,29889,360,2093,301,29915,627,29872,270,29915,496,271,29892,301,29915,6574,627,1190,966,5855,316,18848,634,1190,301,29915,22481,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,7890,16391,29920,2331,712,29871,4277,2947,1874,261,966,5855,316,6316,782,18848,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,1616,12906,1218,1009,18551,363,263,716,577,3934,29899,29872,4599,293,1904,393,7536,277,7093,278,1532,29899,915,292,310,17162,322,278,13013,310,664,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,310,920,1009,7972,1904,1033,14169,12459,29892,1316,408,2893,9215,17202,310,5227,566,352,296,1518,11259,322,6480,278,5855,310,664,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,16667,285,9864,2478,322,443,22492,3656,630,16726,297,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,1439,1461,515,967,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,1852,1041,393,1009,1904,674,376,3167,278,5855,310,2834,472,664,1699,541,947,451,3867,738,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,3732,263,9654,300,3229,1048,599,23440,1600,1295,322,5381,267,1641,2221,304,14169,515,1009,7972,1904,29892,1728,24084,3460,278,7037,18066,267,322,27028,310,16049,1316,263,1788,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,752,7807,18551,363,263,716,577,3934,29899,29872,4599,293,1904,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":57858382478,"load_duration":294355,"prompt_eval_count":182,"prompt_eval_duration":19785139000,"eval_count":278,"eval_duration":38072305000}
