{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T13:30:16.410874986Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker presents a clear and compelling message about the potential of their invention to revolutionize access to information and knowledge. They provide specific examples and data to support their claims, such as the fact that only one person in two has access to the internet today, and their goal of making this forum accessible to everyone.\n\nThe speaker's use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios adds to the persuasive nature of the speech, as it engages the audience emotionally and intellectually. The speaker also demonstrates a thorough understanding of their invention and its potential applications, which further increases the persuasiveness of their message.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker does not provide any data or evidence to support their claim that they can multiply the quantity of information given by 3 between two states distinctes. Additionally, the speaker's use of absolute statements, such as \"seuls une personne sur deux a acc√®s internet,\" could be challenged by providing counter-examples or alternative perspectives.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous, the speech is highly persuasive and effectively conveys the speaker's message about the potential of their invention to revolutionize access to information and knowledge.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,5898,1597,1775,17449,29889,5027,284,283,29948,425,18475,1167,26318,18916,6722,373,263,3008,28230,270,29915,264,11549,261,29889,997,3964,8675,29948,1465,966,1437,643,1372,29892,1465,966,12954,29948,550,29892,301,29915,273,603,29892,1671,18765,261,454,8694,1465,966,20542,9577,7006,715,743,29889,8407,10212,20141,29892,8556,29231,453,787,2535,425,301,14785,270,29915,348,19590,29899,3712,311,29871,29941,29928,29892,1750,8556,19172,296,270,29915,404,2747,316,16797,4110,316,2298,427,2298,8973,29889,2581,1236,1314,12866,10628,7869,25595,358,553,410,4260,7384,270,29915,1540,11549,277,361,1190,27612,1444,6427,8284,29892,1750,16374,1791,261,818,425,10098,10918,1318,634,11071,29872,29889,2581,1236,1314,10628,7869,1597,1873,316,1601,11549,277,361,427,1597,269,2603,457,29892,301,29915,348,1903,5218,818,425,269,2603,457,27046,634,454,29188,261,818,425,269,2603,457,270,29915,19908,29889,1174,443,17478,29892,432,29915,1794,24984,443,22267,29889,8407,9587,316,611,17949,29892,432,29915,1794,8288,2653,1243,261,28374,3987,28374,27829,7719,634,301,29915,1540,270,29915,14056,20554,263,4370,1302,1398,1318,316,24113,29892,592,19172,424,316,6674,4926,425,4323,2131,316,27516,610,29871,29941,2637,29871,29906,2852,1446,8359,267,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,1465,454,9122,29892,409,7273,1597,26744,1190,4239,818,1035,2093,8986,29889,8748,1261,475,29892,8556,5152,1064,787,11469,7697,29884,15579,818,9411,2257,24179,553,1735,29889,2581,7890,425,5582,29892,432,29915,1794,270,30095,29231,5495,818,13162,381,634,1766,276,3479,1775,1934,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,752,7807,2643,1048,278,7037,310,1009,297,7316,304,19479,675,2130,304,2472,322,7134,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,322,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,278,2114,393,871,697,2022,297,1023,756,2130,304,278,8986,9826,29892,322,1009,7306,310,3907,445,24179,15579,304,14332,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,13752,300,936,21846,12778,304,278,20408,294,573,5469,310,278,12032,29892,408,372,3033,1179,278,20026,953,8194,635,322,18715,1474,29889,450,25657,884,9004,1078,263,17826,8004,310,1009,297,7316,322,967,7037,8324,29892,607,4340,16415,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2643,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,848,470,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,896,508,22932,278,14728,310,2472,2183,491,29871,29941,1546,1023,5922,8359,267,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,8380,9506,29892,1316,408,376,344,7273,1597,26744,1190,4239,263,1035,2093,8986,1699,1033,367,18066,287,491,13138,6795,29899,19057,470,8671,3736,1103,3145,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29892,278,12032,338,10712,20408,294,573,322,17583,378,345,952,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,1048,278,7037,310,1009,297,7316,304,19479,675,2130,304,2472,322,7134,29889],"total_duration":143206757227,"load_duration":269861,"prompt_eval_count":313,"prompt_eval_duration":35463165000,"eval_count":311,"eval_duration":107742675000}
