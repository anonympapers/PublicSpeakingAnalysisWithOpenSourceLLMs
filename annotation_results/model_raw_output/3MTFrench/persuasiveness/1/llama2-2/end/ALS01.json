The speaker is able to effectively craft a convincing message and present their argument with clarity and confidence. They provide specific examples and evidence to support their claims, such as the successful creation of a veneer using a micro-scope and the identification of specific components within the clot that appear and disappear over time.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is rigorous and well-structured, with a clear logical flow throughout the speech. They also address potential counterarguments and complications that may arise during the process, showing a good understanding of the limitations and challenges of their work.\n\nHowever, there is one area where the speech could be improved. At times, the speaker's enthusiasm and excitement can come across as overly zealous, which may make some of the technical details difficult to follow for listeners who are not familiar with the field. A more measured and balanced delivery could help to address this issue and make the speech more accessible to a wider audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2298,3240,533,5646,454,1775,4894,295,634,29871,4277,263,8575,29948,29889,2581,16219,1759,1597,325,8146,13162,23855,882,25063,27737,1318,29889,2598,378,13775,274,29915,342,9577,6079,1841,345,453,1318,29889,1720,263,11878,553,885,812,414,29892,980,263,11878,553,3805,1745,267,29892,634,1444,7847,1841,5231,29539,5278,11910,316,325,8146,1671,301,29915,1893,4749,782,9200,29899,6078,29889,1720,343,263,11878,13545,752,5795,29892,980,263,11878,13545,904,29926,562,1558,583,29892,3503,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,29578,1564,5495,29892,10440,634,10440,454,17814,10936,634,270,29915,424,1654,546,29889,16579,802,752,1414,29889,8407,2186,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,375,1039,818,1539,2484,782,1298,443,878,15340,1750,12852,16424,29872,29892,1750,12852,337,4704,1821,634,1750,14924,316,9484,261,1597,25063,27737,1318,325,8146,1509,782,1559,16027,26891,1027,4233,533,818,269,29915,562,2616,276,9201,14255,301,29915,21708,29889,2664,21426,6896,19718,270,29915,326,351,1475,1601,509,296,712,553,7019,339,2063,7175,3476,267,270,29915,29902,1745,4467,3435,15390,270,29915,25378,966,5541,1934,868,5777,453,327,29892,1750,623,2518,19047,634,1750,17508,29874,19047,782,9587,868,8714,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,712,1465,454,3105,332,29892,373,8164,6382,4983,439,29915,585,867,294,4497,381,5000,29892,373,16933,15390,316,544,2487,381,301,29915,29872,2416,562,2131,316,23563,10283,293,20060,316,26722,805,4582,22781,1671,18402,15935,634,427,1027,309,29948,577,647,1318,29889,8748,427,1027,309,29948,577,647,1318,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,1009,2980,411,7542,537,322,16420,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,278,9150,11265,310,263,325,1600,261,773,263,9200,29899,6078,322,278,29769,310,2702,7117,2629,278,1067,327,393,2615,322,25417,975,931,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,29892,411,263,2821,16667,4972,10106,278,12032,29889,2688,884,3211,7037,6795,25699,322,752,5795,393,1122,29030,2645,278,1889,29892,6445,263,1781,8004,310,278,27028,322,18066,267,310,1009,664,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,338,697,4038,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,322,29163,508,2041,4822,408,975,368,3777,20521,29892,607,1122,1207,777,310,278,16905,4902,5189,304,1101,363,11621,414,1058,526,451,9985,411,278,1746,29889,319,901,17005,322,6411,8362,28289,1033,1371,304,3211,445,2228,322,1207,278,12032,901,15579,304,263,25734,20026,29889],"total_duration":64592228816,"load_duration":265806,"prompt_eval_count":313,"prompt_eval_duration":33022047000,"eval_count":231,"eval_duration":31569256000}
