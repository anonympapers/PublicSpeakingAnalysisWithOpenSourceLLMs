The speaker presents an interesting idea about harnessing the heat from a \"pieton d'énergie\" to generate electricity, but the presentation is marred by several factors:\n\n1. Lack of clear explanation: The speaker jumps straight into their idea without providing sufficient context or explanation of how it works. This makes it difficult for the audience to understand the concept and evaluate its feasibility.\n2. Vague language: The speaker uses vague terms like \"pieton d'énergie\" and \"geothermie\" without defining them clearly. This lack of clarity can make it challenging for the audience to follow the speaker's argument.\n3. Inconsistent tone: The speaker switches between a serious tone when discussing their idea and a more flippant tone when describing the potential locations of the \"flites chôts\" or \"géothermues.\" This inconsistency can make it difficult for the audience to take the speaker's argument seriously.\n4. Lack of evidence: The speaker does not provide any empirical evidence to support their claim that harnessing the heat from a \"pieton d'énergie\" can generate electricity. Without any data or studies to back up their idea, the speaker's argument remains speculative and unpersuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's creativity and willingness to think outside the box are admirable, their lack of clear explanation, vague language, inconsistent tone, and lack of evidence hinder their ability to craft a convincing message and demonstrate rigorous reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,452,26099,2331,25974,262,29892,12866,1444,452,26099,2331,966,577,647,743,29892,3503,818,4048,6390,1354,373,707,427,2298,6366,815,29889,11948,7594,8164,29899,5474,409,534,743,272,1190,443,1700,260,29915,264,707,427,16794,29948,454,282,2035,265,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,1577,997,521,744,332,707,10019,680,29885,358,29892,274,29915,342,28185,9373,454,10329,566,270,29915,28619,10273,533,29892,425,10505,720,837,347,316,1487,17887,2245,29889,11948,29871,4277,260,29915,13989,866,29892,4191,373,269,29915,262,3901,634,818,269,29915,29891,274,496,1572,993,454,9122,29889,315,29915,342,18916,5646,301,29915,574,434,1509,316,425,18768,8691,316,611,17949,29889,2581,325,1759,2779,2853,1597,24618,4437,29892,454,1472,316,3999,285,1461,1973,29892,427,16623,424,27962,443,1671,427,24618,1377,1465,454,899,1671,4048,6390,1354,553,1652,3246,521,30069,1372,2123,553,10505,720,837,1041,343,274,496,296,29889,1174,270,29915,14559,1840,267,29892,432,29915,9297,347,316,4048,6390,1354,966,285,1461,1973,868,282,2035,265,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,316,1040,12937,610,427,22259,2131,29892,443,325,4350,28710,316,18643,4371,27799,492,270,29915,14531,521,585,311,29892,782,2757,270,29915,1540,6898,895,1841,1066,573,553,2114,1973,297,1454,351,2406,29892,1671,9073,427,1601,357,5278,447,1082,29892,427,7101,1671,1391,533,316,301,29915,29948,781,2200,2131,29889,478,681,301,29915,1351,29920,7199,275,29892,4883,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,1444,452,325,1759,269,30095,276,358,2331,11817,261,301,29915,14531,521,585,311,29892,3503,432,29915,1794,7732,6063,1671,3686,2747,316,425,734,6013,1318,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,22222,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,385,8031,2969,1048,4023,2264,292,278,12871,515,263,376,1631,20666,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,29908,304,5706,12646,537,29892,541,278,24329,338,1766,1127,491,3196,13879,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,8252,29901,450,25657,432,17204,7812,964,1009,2969,1728,13138,8002,3030,470,8252,310,920,372,1736,29889,910,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,2274,278,6964,322,14707,967,28326,4127,29889,13,29906,29889,478,3437,4086,29901,450,25657,3913,25160,4958,763,376,1631,20666,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,29908,322,376,479,720,837,347,29908,1728,16184,963,9436,29889,910,10225,310,7542,537,508,1207,372,18066,292,363,278,20026,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,29941,29889,512,3200,9696,16225,29901,450,25657,4607,267,1546,263,10676,16225,746,5353,292,1009,2969,322,263,901,285,492,407,424,16225,746,20766,278,7037,14354,310,278,376,1579,3246,521,30069,1372,29908,470,376,29887,29948,720,837,1041,1213,910,22435,391,3819,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,2125,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,25798,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,4023,2264,292,278,12871,515,263,376,1631,20666,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,29908,508,5706,12646,537,29889,13932,738,848,470,11898,304,1250,701,1009,2969,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,9242,1580,28524,322,443,6774,29884,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,907,28157,322,17762,2264,304,1348,5377,278,3800,526,594,2460,18104,29892,1009,10225,310,2821,8252,29892,25160,4086,29892,22435,9696,16225,29892,322,10225,310,10757,298,4995,1009,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,22222,12912,20657,24481,29889],"total_duration":179292935734,"load_duration":362296,"prompt_eval_count":333,"prompt_eval_duration":35496379000,"eval_count":377,"eval_duration":143795530000}
