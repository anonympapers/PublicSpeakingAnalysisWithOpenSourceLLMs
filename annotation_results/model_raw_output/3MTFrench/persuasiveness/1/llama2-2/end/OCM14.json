{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T05:10:50.316652977Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker makes some valid points about the importance of identifying and addressing radicalization and violence in society. However, the delivery of the message is not particularly compelling or convincing. The language used is often vague and general, without providing specific examples or solutions. The speaker also relies heavily on sarcasm and insults, which can come across as condescending and may undermine the credibility of their message. A more persuasive speech would need to provide a clearer and more detailed plan for addressing these issues.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker's arguments are not particularly rigorous or well-supported. They rely heavily on generalizations and stereotypes, rather than providing specific evidence or logical reasoning. For example, the argument that \"gros pays aux l'Azionnistes\" is a more precise way of referring to a particular group is not particularly convincing, as it is based on a simplistic and oversimplified view of complex social issues. A more rigorous speech would need to provide more nuanced and evidence-based arguments.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid points about the importance of addressing radicalization and violence in society, the delivery of the message is not particularly persuasive or well-reasoned.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,553,6013,2925,782,17950,610,346,712,454,17950,707,2893,28677,29889,997,3036,744,452,966,760,29889,2581,1236,1314,14954,4630,443,19696,371,316,17950,29892,1444,1236,1314,2331,14954,4630,443,19696,371,316,3036,744,29889,1174,13495,29892,373,452,8164,2331,425,29415,1190,443,6701,3814,29889,8748,2535,443,6701,20689,29892,425,24818,4371,29892,1597,26744,1750,25810,17756,9073,425,12573,634,1597,14857,29892,1750,409,1539,3018,1564,993,818,9364,276,427,4464,316,432,29915,1794,29899,29880,29915,370,562,29892,274,681,29883,681,29892,289,485,283,1173,29892,260,29915,279,29890,283,1173,29892,260,29915,267,2331,1950,29889,8748,7847,29892,980,21668,1874,261,24145,26722,316,1437,4951,381,966,521,15806,29889,1459,11867,316,24818,4371,29892,274,29915,342,9201,25160,29889,1459,11867,270,29915,11236,6386,5537,1237,29892,274,29915,342,2298,7175,3476,29889,1459,11867,316,872,425,29888,6386,29892,452,8556,623,28759,21181,29889,1459,11867,316,26379,9744,3479,301,29915,16748,291,29876,9230,29892,282,20342,634,2298,3711,381,29889,8748,7847,29892,980,21668,4963,942,27937,29948,316,28078,417,381,27227,7608,553,5829,267,4191,2730,11771,316,26811,275,29889,365,6463,8474,425,24818,4371,818,4595,29899,13147,276,634,970,29892,274,29915,342,9577,432,5079,29892,3503,29871,4277,452,2453,329,21181,2970,29889,319,4951,6311,29892,4875,289,6269,314,434,818,425,18836,29889,8526,4439,29892,301,29915,9706,9509,12784,373,263,925,29872,868,4439,28661,1314,9122,29889,838,943,29892,1444,452,544,1893,355,2331,818,1277,357,2298,316,10814,354,332,2535,15093,260,15532,29892,432,29915,9983,1908,443,7006,2298,316,7019,2764,2131,634,316,18729,29889,2581,724,1794,6079,540,545,1314,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,3732,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,2893,9215,322,3211,292,24818,2133,322,21448,297,12459,29889,2398,29892,278,28289,310,278,2643,338,451,10734,752,7807,470,17953,3277,29889,450,4086,1304,338,4049,25160,322,2498,29892,1728,13138,2702,6455,470,6851,29889,450,25657,884,337,3687,20365,373,269,5666,11625,322,1663,499,29879,29892,607,508,2041,4822,408,2148,9977,2548,322,1122,563,837,457,278,6625,4127,310,1009,2643,29889,319,901,20408,294,573,12032,723,817,304,3867,263,26135,322,901,13173,3814,363,3211,292,1438,5626,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,6273,526,451,10734,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,23765,29889,2688,19104,20365,373,2498,17063,322,269,12358,327,7384,29892,3265,1135,13138,2702,10757,470,16667,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,2980,393,376,29887,1883,9744,3479,301,29915,16748,291,29876,9230,29908,338,263,901,18378,982,310,16811,304,263,3153,2318,338,451,10734,17953,3277,29892,408,372,338,2729,373,263,5466,4695,322,288,874,13699,2164,1776,310,4280,5264,5626,29889,319,901,12912,20657,12032,723,817,304,3867,901,4948,8362,322,10757,29899,6707,6273,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,3211,292,24818,2133,322,21448,297,12459,29892,278,28289,310,278,2643,338,451,10734,20408,294,573,470,1532,29899,23147,287,29889],"total_duration":80101450772,"load_duration":207850,"prompt_eval_count":341,"prompt_eval_duration":35649763000,"eval_count":319,"eval_duration":44450876000}
