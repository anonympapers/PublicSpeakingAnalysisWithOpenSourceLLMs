The speaker is able to effectively craft a convincing message and present it in a clear and organized manner. They use rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \"un monde o√π...\") and metaphors (\"le quinoa\") to emphasize their points and make the speech more engaging for the audience.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is also rigorous, as they provide specific examples of how their proposed solutions could be implemented and the benefits they would bring. They also address potential objections by acknowledging the limitations of their approach but offering a way to overcome them.\n\nHowever, there is one area where the speech could be improved: the speaker's tone could be more enthusiastic and passionate. While they come across as confident and determined, there is a lack of emotional connection with the audience that would make the speech more compelling. With a more engaged and energetic tone, the speaker could further drive home their message and inspire their listeners to take action.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1597,10098,301,29915,391,20600,29892,4875,18332,553,3581,567,316,6411,1759,782,2174,29888,898,29892,634,4875,14931,5644,262,316,2011,267,818,1813,694,312,595,267,29889,838,943,29892,2257,3256,29899,27048,29892,373,263,29892,373,3686,29874,347,316,13942,29877,2496,4239,2134,6609,1671,623,9555,553,6851,782,10212,20141,29889,997,8861,29892,29871,4277,263,4370,14937,625,634,301,29915,352,1908,29889,1551,1083,6689,454,29758,262,26535,1240,569,29889,1551,263,4100,553,3038,2540,1616,12906,7147,29892,4555,274,29915,342,439,29915,4999,269,29915,296,355,24416,6079,2535,966,10890,12173,316,301,29915,26917,29889,997,26617,29892,634,3856,373,2947,3686,2747,316,454,7199,9030,2257,29758,262,29889,830,2818,336,3999,1098,5326,29889,7747,1750,3911,21668,443,3209,802,29892,443,13164,1775,295,294,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,454,24305,316,26957,6062,29948,21337,29892,805,4582,361,3783,316,3038,2540,274,29915,342,1223,296,29889,8748,12866,5278,15217,6635,2445,7661,316,1020,17334,29892,966,623,1379,29892,966,885,1690,720,29948,2390,583,29889,1551,5152,1908,19397,966,1283,12416,427,1015,362,289,993,9373,29889,4241,841,424,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,7890,9073,1597,2504,5340,712,2257,18848,2947,8556,263,1241,818,12036,261,29889,997,8861,270,29915,348,9122,29892,6722,373,1791,1572,28273,267,29892,373,1671,336,2145,2853,818,12278,1875,29892,818,2600,1524,24145,11449,29892,2298,1472,27761,29889,341,5093,1354,373,263,603,2331,454,439,1789,29874,29889,853,9122,29892,6722,28185,9373,712,270,29915,1175,5561,553,8595,818,425,6316,29892,373,13612,5561,29874,316,425,6316,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,372,297,263,2821,322,19098,8214,29889,2688,671,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,348,9122,6722,856,1159,322,1539,12451,943,4852,280,439,1789,29874,1159,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,1207,278,12032,901,3033,6751,363,278,20026,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,884,12912,20657,29892,408,896,3867,2702,6455,310,920,1009,7972,6851,1033,367,8762,322,278,23633,896,723,6963,29889,2688,884,3211,7037,704,24247,491,24084,3460,278,27028,310,1009,2948,541,27032,263,982,304,25688,963,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,338,697,4038,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29901,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,1033,367,901,23644,29875,6288,322,15935,403,29889,5806,896,2041,4822,408,24332,322,10087,29892,727,338,263,10225,310,23023,1848,3957,411,278,20026,393,723,1207,278,12032,901,752,7807,29889,2973,263,901,17785,322,4527,657,293,16225,29892,278,25657,1033,4340,7899,3271,1009,2643,322,8681,533,1009,11621,414,304,2125,3158,29889],"total_duration":66578583074,"load_duration":265231,"prompt_eval_count":328,"prompt_eval_duration":34358913000,"eval_count":237,"eval_duration":32218763000}
