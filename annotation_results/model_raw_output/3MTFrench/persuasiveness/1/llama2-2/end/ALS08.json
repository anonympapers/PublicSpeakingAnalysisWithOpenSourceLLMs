The speaker uses clear and concise language to explain their research and the benefits of their method, which makes it easy to follow and understand. They also use engaging examples and analogies to help illustrate their points, such as comparing the micro-piste to a magic wand.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is rigorous and well-supported by scientific evidence, as they provide specific examples of how their method can improve the accuracy of molecular analysis. They also acknowledge potential limitations and challenges of their approach, which demonstrates their awareness of the complexity of the field and their willingness to continue improving their method.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve their persuasiveness. For example, they could provide more specific examples of how their method has contributed to advancements in the field, or how it can be applied to real-world problems. Additionally, they could expand on the potential implications of their research for a wider audience, such as non-scientists or policymakers.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a clear and compelling argument for their research and its potential impact, which makes their message persuasive and convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1750,263,443,4595,269,519,634,818,425,2058,270,29915,4422,7608,553,8450,21158,2123,553,22683,267,623,598,453,1179,29892,432,29915,4422,895,1597,9200,29899,29886,2488,1671,4642,966,748,30095,2167,29899,29880,29915,22730,634,966,16455,643,29889,16579,802,330,449,371,2947,1970,1089,1597,6062,29948,1810,457,29889,8748,23068,818,443,9200,29899,6078,634,1750,282,2487,296,425,4022,533,634,270,29915,348,22420,7289,712,1444,8230,866,29892,1444,1236,1314,16455,643,425,11101,2131,316,20501,2361,29883,663,316,29871,29941,29900,29900,6062,29948,21337,28374,18402,26617,29889,8748,6701,29892,1444,1671,23469,1841,5231,29539,14344,1750,20501,2361,346,29889,11948,1601,18848,452,269,29915,2749,9061,2331,18916,29899,7176,550,29889,2664,4771,868,14954,1173,332,269,29915,342,316,7199,9030,29889,8748,12866,1671,19601,29892,29871,4277,432,29915,29891,316,7199,9030,1671,339,7768,966,6062,29948,21337,1841,5231,1064,2406,3435,2117,1849,316,20501,2361,2265,29889,838,943,712,966,10890,2245,29879,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,432,29915,7054,895,6267,15259,29889,8748,1671,16219,381,966,6062,29948,21337,966,2298,1506,453,3794,1950,29892,432,29915,404,15802,6701,316,966,626,15817,9386,427,966,1506,5283,1934,443,7006,29889,1459,17488,29892,427,2058,427,443,5541,424,29892,610,443,14857,29889,28079,29871,4277,1465,454,2586,270,29915,1300,265,381,454,330,631,782,1374,598,29892,6062,29948,1810,5218,316,1261,475,29889,315,29915,342,5646,29899,455,1750,1444,301,29915,9983,1908,2947,19172,276,818,5644,262,270,29915,14559,14954,1173,1295,316,6628,1314,22944,29889,8748,12866,6628,1314,7199,9030,301,29915,348,6062,29948,1810,371,1750,409,2852,566,347,29889,853,7006,4191,1354,1444,6267,18332,454,10814,330,631,782,1374,598,29892,1671,1634,29539,301,29915,442,330,1064,538,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,1009,7014,297,263,20408,294,573,8214,29889,450,25657,3913,2821,322,3022,895,4086,304,5649,1009,5925,322,278,23633,310,1009,1158,29892,607,3732,372,4780,304,1101,322,2274,29889,2688,884,671,3033,6751,6455,322,15690,583,304,1371,28475,1009,3291,29892,1316,408,17420,278,9200,29899,29886,2488,304,263,15709,24706,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,491,16021,10757,29892,408,896,3867,2702,6455,310,920,1009,1158,508,11157,278,13600,310,13206,16637,7418,29889,2688,884,18145,5485,7037,27028,322,18066,267,310,1009,2948,29892,607,9004,1078,1009,3773,8326,404,310,278,13644,310,278,1746,322,1009,17762,2264,304,6773,4857,1747,1009,1158,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,20408,294,20193,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,3867,901,2702,6455,310,920,1009,1158,756,26869,304,3061,4564,4110,297,278,1746,29892,470,920,372,508,367,7436,304,1855,29899,11526,4828,29889,19814,29892,896,1033,7985,373,278,7037,2411,5795,310,1009,5925,363,263,25734,20026,29892,1316,408,1661,29899,29879,15566,2879,470,13665,962,21079,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,752,7807,2980,363,1009,5925,322,967,7037,10879,29892,607,3732,1009,2643,20408,294,573,322,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":78020511356,"load_duration":247536,"prompt_eval_count":359,"prompt_eval_duration":37536564000,"eval_count":290,"eval_duration":40483200000}
