The speaker presents a clear and convincing message about the importance of using bio-based materials in construction for a sustainable future. They provide examples of how this can be achieved by valorizing waste from the food and textile industries, such as potato starch and lignin, which are comparable to traditional petrochemical products in terms of physical characteristics. The speaker also emphasizes that this transition is necessary and not just a matter of finding solutions to past mistakes.\n\nThe reasoning presented by the speaker is rigorous and well-supported with laboratory results. They provide specific examples of how bio-based materials can be used in construction, such as using potato starch as a binder in concrete and lignin as a substitute for fossil fuels. The speaker also acknowledges that this transition will not be easy, but it is necessary to avoid further damage to the environment.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a compelling argument for why bio-based materials are essential for sustainable construction practices, and their message is well-supported by evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1775,4894,2993,782,2930,10491,316,3829,1671,425,7632,1411,519,29889,341,2353,553,1757,267,818,3060,275,381,966,282,14229,316,18249,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,966,21136,1379,5695,29892,7847,339,29915,265,966,5663,6223,9411,1465,966,2428,29885,1279,743,2535,966,7067,29879,427,626,347,270,29915,265,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,1794,3060,10770,270,29915,14559,17751,1893,2993,29889,435,29915,1794,3060,10770,316,16497,7608,966,1437,305,1691,316,301,29915,20041,2546,20196,5218,29892,4191,425,282,2736,276,427,1173,610,17488,29892,2123,10440,553,6062,29948,21337,1750,20423,7848,4805,1169,316,425,260,2231,553,715,3794,4191,454,6282,316,899,1750,29892,818,2257,8694,29892,302,29915,342,2331,16497,11728,29889,23719,1039,29892,818,8019,316,7015,4239,2348,29878,2487,10070,29892,980,707,1950,316,6787,533,425,8441,316,1261,475,29889,1551,707,5246,966,5730,5908,1559,16027,275,800,4824,3783,782,10212,20141,29892,373,7629,8356,712,7015,1775,4894,2993,29871,29896,29900,29900,29995,17799,29899,29879,473,29883,743,3435,5734,1849,818,301,29915,487,1924,1750,659,296,29871,1654,316,425,282,1893,307,305,326,347,29889,1720,452,269,29915,23121,2331,316,534,8885,553,6851,1671,1841,862,261,966,1437,29887,1446,712,8556,1029,787,3269,29948,29889,11948,28185,9373,316,1874,261,24145,18551,316,9073,966,521,15806,29889,1704,5278,9558,707,1597,16253,2131,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,17953,3277,2643,1048,278,13500,310,773,17799,29899,6707,17279,297,7632,363,263,15075,475,519,5434,29889,2688,3867,6455,310,920,445,508,367,14363,491,16497,5281,19863,515,278,9687,322,1426,488,6397,2722,29892,1316,408,3104,1219,380,1279,322,301,647,262,29892,607,526,5734,519,304,13807,5697,307,14969,936,9316,297,4958,310,9128,21862,29889,450,25657,884,19310,7093,393,445,9558,338,5181,322,451,925,263,4383,310,9138,6851,304,4940,28947,29889,13,13,1576,24481,9132,491,278,25657,338,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,411,10212,7606,2582,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,310,920,17799,29899,6707,17279,508,367,1304,297,7632,29892,1316,408,773,3104,1219,380,1279,408,263,289,4995,297,18387,322,301,647,262,408,263,23764,363,21983,309,4084,1379,29889,450,25657,884,24084,2710,393,445,9558,674,451,367,4780,29892,541,372,338,5181,304,4772,4340,18658,304,278,5177,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,752,7807,2980,363,2020,17799,29899,6707,17279,526,18853,363,15075,475,519,7632,23274,29892,322,1009,2643,338,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29889],"total_duration":120026188061,"load_duration":273221,"prompt_eval_count":284,"prompt_eval_duration":29655749000,"eval_count":254,"eval_duration":90369553000}
