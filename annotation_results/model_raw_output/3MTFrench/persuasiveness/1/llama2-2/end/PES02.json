The speaker effectively presents their argument by using spatial and social analysis to demonstrate the shift in cycling practices between different territories. They also provide examples from their fieldwork to support their claims. However, the reasoning could be more rigorous in some places, particularly when comparing the usage patterns across different territories. Additionally, the speaker's use of categories to classify cyclists based on their regularity and daily usage feels somewhat arbitrary and could be further justified. Overall, while the speech is persuasive, it could benefit from more detailed analysis and rigorous reasoning to fully convince the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,782,1083,279,802,443,4325,874,29879,882,18652,6728,573,316,301,29915,21125,2637,966,5884,22297,29889,8748,782,2186,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29900,29892,782,1083,279,802,425,544,15819,269,29915,29948,3703,5711,1318,818,3681,29892,8532,712,1487,8744,269,29915,342,1841,700,277,427,13943,561,4894,29889,1605,2093,316,10098,29892,2257,25810,24788,316,301,29915,21125,29892,302,29915,342,2331,23422,18652,29892,3503,5695,5264,29892,454,24502,2488,270,29915,29882,631,18342,424,427,10814,13003,29892,302,29915,342,2331,454,6701,712,454,24502,2488,316,8694,868,18342,424,818,3681,29889,8748,427,2298,316,5278,16455,344,29892,1444,592,26099,26842,404,29948,818,553,1352,6899,29899,29931,11689,29892,6896,1693,427,11172,553,11984,316,10814,13003,29892,1671,966,4325,9996,261,634,7199,9030,454,8744,634,6267,12450,9233,868,12389,417,29889,3872,29883,29892,18097,1444,337,1403,575,818,1601,6974,1318,29892,5646,818,301,29915,28661,29892,8164,29899,5474,410,305,1308,1465,1597,553,6635,2445,3842,712,1444,7890,7468,9551,29948,29892,1354,454,24502,2488,707,6367,352,631,29892,13911,333,819,634,1661,24502,2488,29889,323,2663,16132,29892,782,18679,316,5278,5814,9233,634,316,5278,1841,22481,868,8744,29892,373,8164,7199,9030,712,1354,5278,5814,9233,7905,4370,619,29948,29871,29946,29900,6063,610,1029,749,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,7848,5663,5128,1318,1465,1597,14857,6635,2445,7661,29889,1174,1354,29892,611,266,17449,29892,12468,1808,712,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,22981,1009,2980,491,773,18652,322,5264,7418,304,22222,278,9500,297,5094,19914,23274,1546,1422,5884,3842,29889,2688,884,3867,6455,515,1009,1746,1287,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,297,777,7600,29892,10734,746,17420,278,8744,15038,4822,1422,5884,3842,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,13997,304,770,1598,24502,2879,2729,373,1009,4943,537,322,14218,8744,23880,10579,11472,322,1033,367,4340,925,2164,29889,6811,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,20408,294,573,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,13173,7418,322,12912,20657,24481,304,8072,7602,1239,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":89521650146,"load_duration":222563,"prompt_eval_count":293,"prompt_eval_duration":33115107000,"eval_count":154,"eval_duration":56405607000}
