{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T04:13:26.444243553Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. The speaker presents a clear argument for why their method is superior to traditional simulations, citing the potential for faster simulation times and the ability to simulate complex systems such as the movement of molecules in biological systems. However, the speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or data to support their claims, which hinders their persuasiveness. Additionally, some of the reasoning presented is somewhat abstract and may be difficult for non-experts to follow. Overall, while the speaker presents a compelling argument, they could benefit from providing more tangible evidence and refining their reasoning to make their message more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,7015,2123,1765,1973,20423,23532,443,8714,9577,1472,10042,270,29915,932,2518,13639,29892,2393,8105,882,16380,316,14746,270,29915,524,1064,800,1190,454,1020,479,332,568,29889,349,5818,2257,8714,29899,27048,29892,425,6062,29948,1810,29874,18062,6668,339,1318,1465,454,9775,631,6693,634,966,14954,1173,1295,269,29915,326,3364,1080,19398,6267,22420,7289,29889,2598,1020,479,332,707,316,260,267,5718,267,818,6267,2134,29888,1249,1750,1863,296,818,2730,11771,6079,2298,25595,316,1027,8584,7015,7132,2187,316,923,345,1314,29889,2581,766,712,1354,611,6062,29948,1810,29874,18062,9378,275,10460,1472,27761,6668,339,1318,1465,2257,9775,631,6693,29892,4875,2123,29890,4926,12563,872,23324,14119,1209,1318,29889,2581,1236,1314,8532,534,8885,443,2730,11771,316,269,29915,29891,2316,261,425,23324,14119,3105,332,1190,10741,14177,344,1295,427,610,497,15340,29889,7747,1750,592,14924,316,1841,700,533,316,26722,4991,1230,454,8714,316,17402,29889,8407,29899,6144,30001,316,5278,1139,316,20877,29948,2529,9854,29892,980,19947,6079,270,29915,14559,13107,19503,4824,3783,1190,966,339,1379,7015,6896,19718,1671,336,993,7848,22700,743,29889,3872,29883,29892,439,7768,966,5844,2249,19669,5695,27086,30058,2167,29892,12852,29899,4999,29973,349,1351,7814,19172,276,316,6628,1314,7199,9030,454,9122,1465,27612,8556,9364,787,29889,2581,7890,427,14634,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,2980,363,2020,1009,1158,338,11558,304,13807,23876,29892,7537,292,278,7037,363,8473,17402,3064,322,278,11509,304,29611,4280,6757,1316,408,278,10298,310,13206,21337,297,4768,5996,6757,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,298,513,414,1009,20408,294,20193,29889,19814,29892,777,310,278,24481,9132,338,10579,9846,322,1122,367,5189,363,1661,29899,735,546,1372,304,1101,29889,6811,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,752,7807,2980,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18806,1821,10757,322,2143,2827,1009,24481,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":96700021825,"load_duration":274432,"prompt_eval_count":272,"prompt_eval_duration":31187642000,"eval_count":162,"eval_duration":65511521000}
