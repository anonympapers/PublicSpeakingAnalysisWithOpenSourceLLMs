{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T21:42:29.862790987Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker is not very convincing in their argument against pesticides. They use vague terms like \"stocked in the sediment\" and \"degraded\" without providing any concrete evidence or scientific research to support their claims. Additionally, the speaker's tone is more emotional than logical, which can make their argument less persuasive.\n\nReasoning: The speaker's reasoning is not very rigorous. They use a lot of technical terms without explaining them properly, and they do not provide any scientific studies or data to support their claims. This lack of rigor in their reasoning makes it difficult to take their argument seriously.\n\nOverall, while the speaker may have good intentions, their argument against pesticides is not very persuasive or well-reasoned.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,301,29915,1893,355,29884,347,29892,443,364,284,296,11537,316,301,29915,4582,283,944,29889,7747,1750,263,1671,1136,29948,3910,316,3669,29885,1803,276,966,282,15931,2247,29892,316,20081,1889,375,29892,11797,20423,269,29915,3610,2073,261,634,409,4327,261,29892,634,409,1437,629,1664,634,6701,29889,11948,8532,29892,439,29915,1808,263,454,1889,375,15963,29889,2661,29899,346,712,966,282,15931,2247,3435,10961,743,1465,454,269,3610,2073,29892,9291,29915,30001,2257,439,29915,1540,26379,344,20206,29892,289,1690,361,283,8356,872,534,3096,29872,818,6316,29892,270,29915,12572,782,23520,316,1147,690,29892,634,966,1083,1803,276,427,8872,2673,1661,29899,497,327,29892,3503,18097,980,263,301,29915,28661,316,425,4021,2131,316,5278,447,1082,29892,634,269,29915,309,343,263,553,4656,800,29892,2123,707,2257,712,274,29915,342,1601,24618,1297,760,1577,315,29915,342,301,29915,24031,316,7015,5155,1750,592,9913,327,316,301,29915,267,19428,29892,634,782,13295,1444,325,1759,260,5893,270,29915,279,3511,6299,29879,13933,611,266,17449,29889,2401,441,424,29892,274,29915,342,269,30095,29878,29892,553,25179,787,267,3479,25698,2249,19669,316,425,21180,918,316,301,29915,14531,29889,8748,7847,29892,1750,872,277,29892,443,8694,29892,301,29915,21708,269,29915,264,263,8164,29899,5474,16731,712,2257,1750,707,286,585,1564,275,1671,301,29915,21813,17239,707,8648,286,585,1564,275,1671,3911,29889,11948,29892,1444,8182,275,712,1465,454,2432,9874,29892,8556,1029,787,10440,443,7006,316,1766,276,29889,12603,831,2331,30944,31137,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,338,451,1407,17953,3277,297,1009,2980,2750,282,15931,2247,29889,2688,671,25160,4958,763,376,17712,287,297,278,7048,2073,29908,322,376,311,5105,287,29908,1728,13138,738,18387,10757,470,16021,5925,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,338,901,23023,1848,1135,16667,29892,607,508,1207,1009,2980,3109,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,1123,1658,292,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,1407,12912,20657,29889,2688,671,263,3287,310,16905,4958,1728,24232,963,6284,29892,322,896,437,451,3867,738,16021,11898,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,10225,310,12912,272,297,1009,24481,3732,372,5189,304,2125,1009,2980,25798,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1122,505,1781,7609,1080,29892,1009,2980,2750,282,15931,2247,338,451,1407,20408,294,573,470,1532,29899,23147,287,29889],"total_duration":52255409675,"load_duration":267050,"prompt_eval_count":315,"prompt_eval_duration":26485424000,"eval_count":212,"eval_duration":25769123000}
