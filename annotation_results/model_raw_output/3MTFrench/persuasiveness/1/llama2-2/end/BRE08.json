Here's why:\n\nStrengths:\n\n* The speaker is passionate about their topic and uses humor and anecdotes to keep the audience engaged.\n* They make a compelling argument that the current system of governance is outdated and in need of reform.\n* They provide examples of how other actors, such as NGOs and corporations, have successfully taken on roles in global governance, suggesting that there are multiple paths to achieving these goals.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* The speaker's argument is somewhat narrowly focused on the idea that the state should be replaced by a diverse array of actors, without fully addressing the potential challenges and limitations of this approach.\n* While they provide some examples of successful non-state actors, they do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach.\n* The speaker's tone is somewhat confrontational and dismissive of existing governance structures, which may make it difficult for them to win over skeptical listeners.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling arguments and examples, they could benefit from a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of the issues at hand.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8997,454,13222,553,8595,29871,29896,29929,29947,29900,29892,553,8478,7719,1887,267,6701,553,8820,270,29915,328,29948,1830,358,634,610,6267,1518,4894,663,29892,634,6267,1518,1064,2938,20554,409,3435,7275,2406,4191,553,1044,11620,10918,277,1355,316,7015,24305,29889,8407,1298,6701,18097,29871,29906,29900,29900,29945,29892,966,5233,29899,11604,25238,790,10978,10713,364,30069,793,4191,7618,1455,267,1671,21609,19844,966,1203,10270,868,3533,29948,15421,1671,454,24305,29889,23719,1039,29892,9811,342,269,29915,1144,9695,1465,443,1139,21941,21394,2298,2919,316,2257,712,8556,9411,6382,262,787,316,425,15306,749,14475,634,6701,425,15306,749,316,7814,9744,29889,317,4745,1314,29899,29876,681,2779,19882,1209,743,1465,1597,13752,17449,316,2373,29948,29889,8526,301,29915,3027,270,29915,1540,6894,2131,270,29915,627,11620,29892,8556,17078,1080,925,882,270,29915,1540,6894,2131,270,29915,348,4595,819,29892,7209,1671,1120,424,427,11113,276,4021,2131,634,427,748,7425,29889,8748,868,10814,2373,29948,29892,1444,1236,1314,7890,2970,29892,432,29915,264,7468,25016,29948,29889,4360,344,29892,274,29915,342,10814,712,553,3516,21158,29889,838,943,29892,1671,4048,6390,1354,301,29915,29923,8101,18062,454,1539,2484,297,1285,342,29948,868,9122,29892,19643,29920,29899,23088,818,611,13267,264,749,1465,443,385,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,5015,1477,29879,29901,13,13,29930,450,25657,338,15935,403,1048,1009,11261,322,3913,27448,322,385,687,29881,4769,304,3013,278,20026,17785,29889,13,29930,2688,1207,263,752,7807,2980,393,278,1857,1788,310,4095,749,338,714,9715,322,297,817,310,11736,29889,13,29930,2688,3867,6455,310,920,916,29701,29892,1316,408,405,17080,29879,322,17266,800,29892,505,8472,4586,373,16178,297,5534,4095,749,29892,26233,393,727,526,2999,10898,304,3657,15387,1438,14433,29889,13,13,4806,557,2264,267,29901,13,13,29930,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,10579,12474,368,21309,373,278,2969,393,278,2106,881,367,8611,491,263,16984,1409,310,29701,29892,1728,8072,3211,292,278,7037,18066,267,322,27028,310,445,2948,29889,13,29930,5806,896,3867,777,6455,310,9150,1661,29899,3859,29701,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,15171,6270,7418,310,278,7037,23633,322,4216,1627,29879,310,445,2948,29889,13,29930,450,25657,29915,29879,16225,338,10579,21751,1288,322,18918,573,310,5923,4095,749,12286,29892,607,1122,1207,372,5189,363,963,304,5401,975,18109,415,936,11621,414,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,752,7807,6273,322,6455,29892,896,1033,14169,515,263,901,4948,8362,322,15171,6270,7418,310,278,5626,472,1361,29889],"total_duration":134160225226,"load_duration":318253,"prompt_eval_count":267,"prompt_eval_duration":27922835000,"eval_count":295,"eval_duration":106236087000}
