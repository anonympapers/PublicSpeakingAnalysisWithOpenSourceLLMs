{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T01:00:23.144305884Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness in crafting a convincing message. The speaker does present some reasonable arguments and evidence to support their claims, but there are also some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the speaker's use of humor and anecdotes to keep the audience engaged and make their points more relatable. For example, the speaker uses a clever analogy about the importance of Equilibrine and Gilette for the treatment of détectés to help illustrate their point. However, there are also some moments where the speaker's delivery feels a bit disjointed or unpolished, which could detract from the overall persuasiveness of the message.\n\nIn terms of the speaker's use of evidence and reasoning, they do provide some references to scientific studies and literature to support their claims. However, there are also some instances where the speaker seems to be making assertions without providing sufficient evidence or logical reasoning to back them up. For example, the speaker mentions that a certain medication is \"known for ralentir les symptômes de maladie,\" but does not provide any specific data or research to support this claim.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in terms of crafting a convincing message, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make their argument even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,553,1437,371,312,743,7175,3476,15471,29892,1597,4439,328,347,316,301,29915,19898,1465,454,541,1465,425,15378,545,634,454,1020,17334,29889,10793,4439,328,347,29892,7890,8992,29920,8164,29899,5474,20737,875,355,29884,610,1358,427,12278,424,425,752,5889,316,4771,13017,4371,818,425,13745,2637,4239,904,3334,2631,634,10375,29892,274,29915,342,425,1437,314,29948,433,29892,553,6094,16555,2925,29892,611,13949,1908,29892,619,21659,482,634,1671,626,15817,9386,454,1020,17334,29892,980,592,21668,4239,521,15806,29889,365,30001,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,21871,309,2131,29892,12866,330,488,24087,634,2331,966,923,345,1314,634,5528,2172,424,301,29915,16063,457,1314,1671,1437,371,312,261,29889,6803,425,7019,781,440,2131,29892,432,29915,1794,904,572,987,29948,425,11721,4437,634,1597,6062,29948,802,301,29915,28997,2016,634,18475,441,277,868,301,29915,19898,29889,6340,707,25456,1671,364,284,296,381,966,25828,30069,4467,316,4439,328,347,29892,3503,22786,296,9577,7006,454,18062,868,14913,29889,315,29915,342,26842,404,424,1671,19601,610,346,712,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,439,29915,1808,707,20737,7019,781,573,29892,3503,1601,2553,449,2123,540,545,22527,8164,29899,5474,29892,4875,302,29915,342,2331,868,1375,3121,29889,838,943,19601,5695,29892,432,29915,1794,337,1777,29948,611,1999,1709,29892,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,611,521,457,634,1506,1318,610,2078,29883,29892,1444,16623,2594,374,634,611,6062,29948,802,9291,29915,30001,2257,439,29915,264,1436,29892,425,19703,5289,12852,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,15590,6273,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,27448,322,385,687,29881,4769,304,3013,278,20026,17785,322,1207,1009,3291,901,1104,17219,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3913,263,23455,3483,6933,1048,278,13500,310,11243,309,4626,457,322,402,488,24087,363,278,14502,310,1437,371,312,743,304,1371,28475,1009,1298,29889,2398,29892,727,526,884,777,19462,988,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,23880,263,2586,766,12090,287,470,443,3733,3276,29892,607,1033,1439,1461,515,278,12463,20408,294,20193,310,278,2643,29889,13,13,797,4958,310,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,10757,322,24481,29892,896,437,3867,777,9282,304,16021,11898,322,12845,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,526,884,777,8871,988,278,25657,2444,304,367,3907,4974,1080,1728,13138,8002,10757,470,16667,24481,304,1250,963,701,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,263,3058,13589,362,338,376,5203,363,364,284,296,381,966,25828,30069,4467,316,4439,328,347,1699,541,947,451,3867,738,2702,848,470,5925,304,2304,445,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,4958,310,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,1009,2980,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":65635969672,"load_duration":199000,"prompt_eval_count":309,"prompt_eval_duration":26084966000,"eval_count":320,"eval_duration":39550251000}
