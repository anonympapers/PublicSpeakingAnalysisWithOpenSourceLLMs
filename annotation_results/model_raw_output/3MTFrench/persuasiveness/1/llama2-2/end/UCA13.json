{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T02:53:02.651552489Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker does present some valid points and reasoning, but there are also some areas where their argument could be strengthened.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of rhetorical questions to engage the audience and make them think about the topic at hand. For example, when the speaker asks \"What if I told you that there's something better than a piquet?\", it creates a sense of curiosity and intrigue among the listeners. Additionally, the speaker does a good job of highlighting the potential benefits of their proposed solution, such as not having to worry about being tired or feeling guilty.\n\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses in the speech that could be improved. One major issue is the lack of evidence or logical reasoning to support the speaker's claims. For example, the statement \"Eu estou com o piquet e n√£o me disse\" lacks any concrete evidence or explanation to back it up, making it difficult for the audience to understand or take seriously. Additionally, the speaker's argument relies heavily on repetition, which can come across as monotonous and less persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some persuasive elements, it could benefit from more evidence-based reasoning and variety in the delivery to make it more engaging and convincing for the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,904,29871,30944,31081,29872,26490,316,321,1764,782,342,359,953,11784,30033,720,804,321,409,7931,30037,904,712,263,12946,423,325,1794,5424,1922,2930,12621,321,29892,8145,904,4439,29892,4552,1350,24673,712,8145,904,288,712,11878,29889,319,12946,423,325,1794,5424,1922,2930,12621,321,8145,904,316,4439,29892,321,1702,712,2897,652,294,8145,592,12124,14054,29892,8145,1350,25801,712,11878,707,283,953,286,326,29892,560,267,592,13612,566,314,316,5424,1922,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29889,16430,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,5516,11878,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,5516,11878,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,5516,11878,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,5516,11878,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,5516,11878,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,5516,11878,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,5516,11878,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,5516,11878,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,5516,11878,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,2854,3291,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,1009,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,963,1348,1048,278,11261,472,1361,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,278,25657,19514,376,5618,565,306,5429,366,393,727,29915,29879,1554,2253,1135,263,2930,12621,29973,613,372,10017,263,4060,310,27742,322,11158,12137,4249,278,11621,414,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,12141,292,278,7037,23633,310,1009,7972,1650,29892,1316,408,451,2534,304,15982,1048,1641,23407,470,11223,27719,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,8062,2264,267,297,278,12032,393,1033,367,16710,29889,3118,4655,2228,338,278,10225,310,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,3229,376,29923,29884,707,283,419,288,2930,12621,321,8145,592,29340,29908,425,4684,738,18387,10757,470,8252,304,1250,372,701,29892,3907,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,2274,470,2125,25798,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,21159,654,29892,607,508,2041,4822,408,21196,265,681,322,3109,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,756,777,20408,294,573,3161,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,10757,29899,6707,24481,322,12875,297,278,28289,304,1207,372,901,3033,6751,322,17953,3277,363,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":65362266690,"load_duration":167664,"prompt_eval_count":236,"prompt_eval_duration":24491019000,"eval_count":303,"eval_duration":40870574000}
