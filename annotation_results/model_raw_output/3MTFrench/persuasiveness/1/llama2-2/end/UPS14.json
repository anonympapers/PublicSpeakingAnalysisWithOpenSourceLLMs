The speaker presents their idea in a clear and organized manner, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by introducing the problem of understanding the resistance of a particular type of material, which is a common challenge in their field. They then propose a solution based on the angle of torsions and distance between microscopic voids, which seems like a plausible approach at first glance. However, the speaker does not provide enough detail or evidence to fully convince the audience of the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that they have \"réussi à aller les vinceaux,\" but it is unclear what this means or how it relates to the topic at hand. Additionally, the speaker does not provide any specific examples or case studies to illustrate the potential of their proposed solution.\n\nWhile the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for the topic are evident, they could benefit from providing more concrete evidence and logical reasoning to support their claims. With some additional detail and rigor, the speech could be more persuasive and effective in convincing the audience of its merits.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2257,1750,2947,286,29915,524,1064,16136,29892,274,29915,342,316,19397,634,878,3610,7608,634,544,2487,381,425,6896,21558,316,425,24304,6184,712,432,29915,1794,9484,29948,29889,1174,18165,316,10741,1828,14228,29892,4191,925,882,301,29915,2521,316,260,943,1080,29892,3503,5695,425,5418,270,29915,14056,655,488,358,29889,7747,1750,5246,439,29915,585,13911,333,819,707,6079,1444,592,18593,553,5155,4191,707,29899,346,712,29871,4277,260,993,6628,1314,1190,24145,10524,21394,427,16263,270,29915,348,17887,7006,2123,1190,24145,10524,443,17887,7006,427,16263,270,29915,348,21394,29973,315,29915,342,10814,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,375,1039,818,16454,966,325,1239,2993,29892,5291,831,6079,10019,1693,29889,8748,6701,1354,7015,5155,269,13365,296,9577,805,4582,361,3783,29892,20554,325,609,8556,19172,276,316,6787,533,553,878,30000,793,13219,272,3783,21394,2298,16805,1314,1750,1437,699,794,1597,2919,24988,1004,316,1775,4894,2993,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,553,1775,4894,2993,4280,267,29889,8748,1671,427,337,15470,818,7814,3184,787,29892,7890,29871,22730,3058,882,6974,29948,29871,1654,29892,427,7890,766,424,966,3184,787,29892,373,24722,9577,6079,2257,712,274,29915,342,29892,274,29915,342,553,3778,2993,17520,3783,29892,25235,14746,29892,3667,267,5695,29892,3503,980,343,263,2298,4595,12784,818,4048,6390,1190,23778,29889,8748,6079,432,29915,9983,1908,439,29915,264,2656,424,29892,7890,1095,9386,15749,24145,18551,29892,610,346,712,4191,766,1249,454,17887,15927,29892,17043,13639,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,313,2111,261,2486,9034,29884,294,573,29897,363,278,12032,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,19098,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,4547,3277,278,1108,310,8004,278,17711,310,263,3153,1134,310,5518,29892,607,338,263,3619,18766,297,1009,1746,29889,2688,769,16193,263,1650,2729,373,278,10696,310,260,943,1080,322,5418,1546,9200,21785,293,1780,29879,29892,607,2444,763,263,2174,375,1821,2948,472,937,21798,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,3307,9493,470,10757,304,8072,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,2779,20193,310,445,2948,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,505,376,5606,375,1039,818,16454,966,325,1239,2993,1699,541,372,338,20871,825,445,2794,470,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,11261,472,1361,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,1206,11898,304,28475,278,7037,310,1009,7972,1650,29889,13,13,8809,488,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,322,15935,363,278,11261,526,13602,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18387,10757,322,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2973,777,5684,9493,322,12912,272,29892,278,12032,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,322,11828,297,17953,3277,278,20026,310,967,2778,1169,29889],"total_duration":77710482361,"load_duration":291469,"prompt_eval_count":305,"prompt_eval_duration":35929856000,"eval_count":279,"eval_duration":41779678000}
