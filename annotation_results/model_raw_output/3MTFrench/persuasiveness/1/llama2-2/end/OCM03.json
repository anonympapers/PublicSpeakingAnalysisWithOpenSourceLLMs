{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T05:18:59.93945405Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker does a good job of presenting their argument in a clear and concise manner. They use examples and anecdotes to illustrate their points, which helps to make their message more relatable and engaging for the audience. However, the speech lacks a strong call to action or a clear conclusion, which could have made it more persuasive.\n2. Rigor of reasoning: The speaker's use of language and logic is generally sound, but there are some instances where their arguments could be strengthened with additional evidence or logical reasoning. For example, the speaker claims that they have found a method to study the typicité of products under appellation d'origine protégée, but they do not provide any specific details or examples to support this claim.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-delivered and engaging, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and a clearer call to action to make it more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,4727,15471,29892,443,11107,316,325,647,787,29892,301,29915,1947,647,706,316,425,5694,29948,768,29948,29892,29871,4277,5246,2298,712,29871,29896,29947,29900,1473,267,29889,11948,7907,11469,1209,29948,553,26893,818,8689,6267,610,1772,29892,1444,966,7468,1410,1241,1224,443,7931,370,25290,3817,1671,1437,699,276,966,1559,23096,7209,10375,1314,2393,3783,316,6267,9712,29889,13861,439,7768,29892,966,325,647,787,4625,1437,29881,504,30000,1912,818,425,25160,634,3483,952,29948,7015,1559,23096,1671,25497,276,818,425,1139,29892,2257,9712,707,1597,2393,1387,316,26814,623,3610,362,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,7907,11469,11465,29948,2535,553,1644,13116,316,325,647,787,634,724,1730,553,3533,4285,316,1224,29899,311,29899,29878,1975,29892,1444,7199,1975,6628,1314,7015,13830,5216,7545,29892,6267,619,264,782,18249,29899,307,381,634,10713,1178,2925,29899,6772,1760,267,564,374,2122,29889,11948,454,5882,29892,274,29915,342,712,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,1597,8774,386,356,1671,2852,566,631,425,2393,293,2131,316,1391,1169,5898,29899,932,3610,362,270,29915,17234,17512,2445,1318,29889,897,1667,29892,5278,8774,386,356,592,19172,336,316,6628,1314,7890,610,1358,316,29899,29878,1975,29889,23719,1039,29892,7890,1671,15749,3060,275,381,2298,2258,455,944,2637,966,2778,345,7545,325,647,787,868,25407,270,29915,542,2124,1080,29892,14864,712,7890,7175,29888,25138,966,302,1446,316,1437,3334,344,2123,966,302,1446,316,11492,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29889,2688,671,6455,322,385,687,29881,4769,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,607,6911,304,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,322,3033,6751,363,278,20026,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,263,4549,1246,304,3158,470,263,2821,15997,29892,607,1033,505,1754,372,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,322,5900,338,6892,6047,29892,541,727,526,777,8871,988,1009,6273,1033,367,9324,6419,411,5684,10757,470,16667,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,16726,393,896,505,1476,263,1158,304,6559,278,2393,293,2131,310,9316,1090,623,514,362,270,29915,17234,17512,2445,1318,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,4902,470,6455,304,2304,445,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,1532,29899,6144,2147,287,322,3033,6751,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,263,26135,1246,304,3158,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":65585005478,"load_duration":259219,"prompt_eval_count":296,"prompt_eval_duration":31445846000,"eval_count":251,"eval_duration":34138308000}
