{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T15:39:45.537563262Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. The speaker presents some interesting ideas about how our brains process information and how it can be used to better manage complexity in our lives. However, the argument could benefit from more logical coherence and evidential support.\n\nThe speaker's main point is that we don’t need to understand how our brains work to live our lives effectively, but rather than providing evidence or examples to support this claim, they rely on vague statements like “it’s like a mess” and “we wouldn’t be here if we needed to understand how it works the first time.” While these statements may elicit some emotional response from the audience, they don’t provide a rigorous argument that can be evaluated or critiqued.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker’s argument could benefit from more concrete examples of how understanding how our brains work could lead to practical applications in various aspects of life. By providing more specific evidence and logical reasoning, the speaker could make their argument more persuasive and compelling.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas, the argument could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidential support to make it more convincing and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,6267,639,1441,868,8714,29889,28079,29871,4277,1671,7199,9030,3440,6628,1314,19493,261,8691,553,8774,3068,1608,267,316,24145,5147,345,585,712,2257,12852,1671,6628,1314,330,29539,425,4280,2131,8182,790,1647,316,7814,325,583,1671,4224,283,20069,1597,2637,29883,5606,29882,1926,2131,2123,1671,6628,1314,7199,9030,23563,25698,19503,6042,2993,29889,1551,8164,9577,6079,9364,276,634,23440,9030,5644,262,316,521,15806,7209,325,336,2073,7199,9030,3440,373,18165,484,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,23309,29889,8748,2637,8556,29892,274,29915,342,4191,443,5516,361,29892,18097,373,343,1841,1579,17192,277,29889,897,24145,21384,29892,1354,373,7905,3008,28230,316,7199,9030,29892,3440,373,18165,484,818,425,8861,10098,29889,6803,844,22687,818,9364,276,29892,373,26030,18413,844,3977,29948,634,373,452,16933,2331,18916,29889,1459,346,712,274,29915,342,18097,6701,443,1095,15164,316,409,3209,29883,1318,425,17949,1671,7199,9030,2257,1750,409,21714,1465,443,3147,29873,2353,29889,29871,30219,29874,2947,2970,1354,373,18331,818,9073,29892,5646,2257,439,29915,265,18331,818,9073,29889,27677,7199,9030,3440,373,5246,29889,11948,14034,29920,2257,439,29915,265,1671,8356,9073,29889,6101,373,26939,6628,1314,29892,5646,2257,1750,409,21714,18916,29899,29882,1300,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,1048,920,1749,4105,1144,1889,2472,322,920,372,508,367,1304,304,2253,10933,13644,297,1749,12080,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,14169,515,901,16667,16165,261,663,322,13602,616,2304,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,1667,1298,338,393,591,1016,30010,29873,817,304,2274,920,1749,4105,1144,664,304,5735,1749,12080,17583,29892,541,3265,1135,13138,10757,470,6455,304,2304,445,5995,29892,896,19104,373,25160,9506,763,1346,277,30010,29879,763,263,4473,30024,322,1346,705,7656,30010,29873,367,1244,565,591,4312,304,2274,920,372,1736,278,937,931,3178,5806,1438,9506,1122,560,293,277,777,23023,1848,2933,515,278,20026,29892,896,1016,30010,29873,3867,263,12912,20657,2980,393,508,367,19030,470,3994,8105,287,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,30010,29879,2980,1033,14169,515,901,18387,6455,310,920,8004,920,1749,4105,1144,664,1033,3275,304,15031,8324,297,5164,21420,310,2834,29889,2648,13138,901,2702,10757,322,16667,24481,29892,278,25657,1033,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,752,7807,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,29892,278,2980,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,13602,616,2304,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,322,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":110878760892,"load_duration":302937,"prompt_eval_count":255,"prompt_eval_duration":23269463000,"eval_count":278,"eval_duration":87608423000}
