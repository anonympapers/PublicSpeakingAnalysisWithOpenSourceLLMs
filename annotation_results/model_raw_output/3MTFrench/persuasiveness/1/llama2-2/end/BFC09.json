{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T16:21:29.177993817Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using simple language that is easy to understand. They also provide examples and evidence to support their claim that having a diverse set of weights can help identify and eliminate bad seeds. However, the speaker does not provide any concrete data or research to back up their claims, which may make their argument less persuasive to some listeners.\n\nRigorous reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is generally sound, but there are a few areas where they could improve. For example, they do not provide any logical explanations for why having a diverse set of weights can help identify and eliminate bad seeds. Additionally, the speaker's use of the term \"mauvaisers\" (bad seeds) is somewhat vague and could be more specifically defined in order to make their argument more convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and convincing argument, there are areas where they could improve in terms of providing more rigorous reasoning and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8474,966,286,585,1564,275,414,29889,1174,5246,29892,2298,443,772,4841,16933,3581,13416,424,29892,11387,966,286,585,1564,275,414,289,24729,1035,2093,818,425,19703,5289,634,12866,11387,1671,24416,409,13942,29877,2496,29889,838,943,16134,424,8556,1029,787,2893,29792,712,2257,19397,3581,13416,424,6303,443,1559,627,1908,611,1324,332,1465,425,15481,371,8474,966,286,585,1564,275,414,29889,2581,325,1759,5278,10098,1243,261,443,4595,5419,316,27128,743,316,772,4841,29892,29871,29896,29955,29900,634,1677,21735,316,12563,301,29915,15654,29889,315,29915,342,29871,29896,29955,29900,270,29915,5903,5705,743,270,29915,16061,316,772,4841,29892,22847,20554,5695,553,1559,23096,9577,28374,29889,11948,5278,10098,29892,432,29915,1794,8648,1437,18821,29948,454,22191,26052,6094,19971,316,301,29915,24031,316,4883,7105,1446,29889,4231,6311,29892,1444,1236,1314,5734,261,5278,2472,6094,19971,2535,425,4323,2131,316,286,585,1564,275,414,22847,1465,18402,1597,316,4883,20067,1379,772,4841,1999,743,29889,8748,8288,1437,18821,261,13545,11581,267,23532,427,16731,1671,11469,443,10814,544,1893,5818,29889,853,544,1893,5818,1750,452,425,5582,2331,425,2058,782,286,585,1564,275,414,316,409,13942,29877,2496,29889,8748,274,29915,342,8288,712,1444,16731,5814,5893,818,24145,2646,2131,316,1999,743,427,760,2386,533,316,772,4841,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,393,338,4780,304,2274,29889,2688,884,3867,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,2534,263,16984,731,310,18177,508,1371,12439,322,27399,4319,409,5779,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,848,470,5925,304,1250,701,1009,16726,29892,607,1122,1207,1009,2980,3109,20408,294,573,304,777,11621,414,29889,13,13,29934,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,6892,6047,29892,541,727,526,263,2846,10161,988,896,1033,11157,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,16667,7309,800,363,2020,2534,263,16984,731,310,18177,508,1371,12439,322,27399,4319,409,5779,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,278,1840,376,29885,585,1564,275,414,29908,313,12313,409,5779,29897,338,10579,25160,322,1033,367,901,10816,3342,297,1797,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,17953,3277,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,297,4958,310,13138,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":69442263708,"load_duration":298221,"prompt_eval_count":271,"prompt_eval_duration":31436256000,"eval_count":260,"eval_duration":38005080000}
