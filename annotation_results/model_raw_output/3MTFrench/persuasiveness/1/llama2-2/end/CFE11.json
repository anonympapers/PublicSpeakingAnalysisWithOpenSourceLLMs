{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T10:25:52.262889808Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. The speaker provides some interesting insights into the evolution of metabolites in the blood and how they can be used to identify individuals with metabolic syndrome. However, there are some areas where the speaker could improve:\n\n1. Lack of clarity: At times, the speaker's arguments are not always clear, and it can be difficult to follow their train of thought. For example, when discussing the 3 million 8,000 variables, the speaker jumps abruptly from talking about the number of variables to discussing the amount of data needed for a simple blood test without providing any context or explanation.\n2. Lack of evidence: While the speaker provides some interesting insights, there is limited evidence presented to support their claims. For example, there is no discussion of the scientific studies that could have confirmed the speaker's theories.\n3. Unclear conclusions: The speaker's conclusions are not always clear or well-supported. For example, the statement \"Il suffira alors, sauvé de l'hôtil\" is unclear and seems to be a stretch from the rest of the argument.\n4. Overuse of jargon: The speaker uses some technical terms that may not be familiar to the audience, such as \"métabolites\", \"délutant\", and \"sanguines\". While these terms are relevant to the topic, they can make the speech difficult to follow for non-experts.\n5. Lack of enthusiasm: The speaker's delivery is somewhat flat and lacking in enthusiasm. This can make the speech less engaging and persuasive for the audience.\n\nOverall, while there are some interesting insights presented in the transcript, the speaker could improve their argumentation and delivery to increase the persuasiveness of their message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,409,9073,29892,1444,592,2967,29892,1190,301,29915,29948,4068,553,11510,19388,3246,29892,1465,454,13625,29889,11948,8648,1190,553,21880,385,484,9100,29892,1136,10799,358,966,480,27499,29889,1459,17488,29892,301,29915,279,11236,2131,4824,1387,2123,10713,4760,8192,20196,7147,29889,28079,267,7015,19313,29899,27048,3435,6299,29879,270,29915,30001,19119,29889,315,29915,342,818,454,12450,5893,1597,4323,2131,16133,6947,569,316,21880,1871,19669,29889,9353,1601,3209,29892,2257,3435,16573,316,29871,29941,14746,29871,29947,29871,29900,29900,29900,3651,29889,478,681,7890,1437,29890,819,712,29871,29896,29900,29900,11872,690,316,27188,329,424,29892,29871,29941,8595,29871,29896,29900,452,3435,2331,9201,1671,5646,534,1664,29889,4231,6311,29892,818,425,1436,316,611,9982,29892,634,23068,818,425,16455,344,316,14984,7015,21880,29892,1444,2906,8356,19397,9551,261,1597,13773,316,6062,29948,21337,269,2375,1475,1559,16027,275,424,454,22898,4871,11510,19388,1387,29889,1720,9378,3055,8532,270,29915,6388,7608,1597,2560,2298,316,13625,29879,782,15732,316,286,585,280,1671,410,6772,914,872,20877,29948,10042,712,454,652,370,12973,302,29915,342,2601,634,712,966,1437,29887,30057,1372,452,577,993,2331,18764,1821,29889,1551,1671,336,8288,29892,12507,12491,316,301,29915,29882,30069,1376,29889,8748,2145,2853,818,409,325,9030,553,274,1943,2993,5898,454,21672,262,29889,838,943,29892,818,16053,13650,276,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,14675,310,1539,19388,3246,297,278,10416,322,920,896,508,367,1304,304,12439,15724,411,1539,19388,293,22898,4871,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,526,451,2337,2821,29892,322,372,508,367,5189,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,5353,292,278,29871,29941,7284,29871,29947,29892,29900,29900,29900,3651,29892,278,25657,432,17204,633,6685,368,515,9963,1048,278,1353,310,3651,304,5353,292,278,5253,310,848,4312,363,263,2560,10416,1243,1728,13138,738,3030,470,8252,29889,13,29906,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,29892,727,338,9078,10757,9132,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,727,338,694,10679,310,278,16021,11898,393,1033,505,16725,278,25657,29915,29879,25841,29889,13,29941,29889,853,8551,21204,1080,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,21204,1080,526,451,2337,2821,470,1532,29899,23765,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,3229,376,14126,9378,3055,8532,29892,12507,12491,316,301,29915,29882,30069,1376,29908,338,20871,322,2444,304,367,263,16116,515,278,1791,310,278,2980,29889,13,29946,29889,6811,1509,310,432,1191,265,29901,450,25657,3913,777,16905,4958,393,1122,451,367,9985,304,278,20026,29892,1316,408,376,29885,1893,19388,3246,613,376,29881,3610,329,424,613,322,376,29879,2375,1475,1642,5806,1438,4958,526,8018,304,278,11261,29892,896,508,1207,278,12032,5189,304,1101,363,1661,29899,735,546,1372,29889,13,29945,29889,365,547,310,23644,3173,29885,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,28289,338,10579,12151,322,10225,292,297,23644,3173,29885,29889,910,508,1207,278,12032,3109,3033,6751,322,20408,294,573,363,278,20026,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,8031,1663,5861,9132,297,278,1301,924,29892,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,322,28289,304,7910,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2643,29889],"total_duration":190783465694,"load_duration":278485,"prompt_eval_count":281,"prompt_eval_duration":28771885000,"eval_count":425,"eval_duration":162010714000}
