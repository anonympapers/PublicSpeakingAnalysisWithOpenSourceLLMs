{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T16:22:16.588178077Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. The speaker seems to be relying heavily on emotional appeals rather than logical arguments to persuade their audience. While they do mention the importance of taking consciousness into account when making decisions, they do not provide any concrete evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims.\n\nThe speaker also seems to be using a bit of a \"straw man\" argument by presenting two extreme sides of the issue without providing any nuance or middle ground. This makes it difficult for the audience to evaluate the speaker's argument objectively. Additionally, the speaker's use of rhetorical questions and appeals to emotion can come across as manipulative rather than persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's message may be well-intentioned, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,712,301,29915,2249,8194,263,904,12232,9139,8121,29874,17889,4100,1465,454,19590,316,4224,2459,29889,365,29915,2249,8194,707,904,12232,9139,1190,544,27153,1661,29889,360,29915,348,21384,8556,1029,787,425,2635,818,1750,8556,14924,270,29915,496,1308,7209,427,23532,27688,29889,8748,316,301,29915,18288,8556,1029,787,5278,904,29885,8194,1750,8556,13417,277,818,782,2186,23532,1597,4224,2459,782,1016,271,316,425,2635,818,443,29889,11948,782,6299,712,12852,27128,519,358,454,3132,782,9657,562,316,425,27516,1465,454,9122,868,13436,29889,1459,346,712,454,330,13796,2186,707,6079,2852,370,819,782,521,542,324,271,634,274,29915,342,6079,19601,1750,966,3060,275,583,634,610,16631,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,2444,304,367,337,5890,20365,373,23023,1848,5929,1338,3265,1135,16667,6273,304,20408,1943,1009,20026,29889,5806,896,437,3585,278,13500,310,5622,19861,2264,964,3633,746,3907,1602,12112,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,2444,304,367,773,263,2586,310,263,376,303,1610,767,29908,2980,491,2198,292,1023,18677,11192,310,278,2228,1728,13138,738,4948,749,470,7256,5962,29889,910,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,14707,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1203,3598,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,5929,1338,304,953,8194,508,2041,4822,408,11525,28524,3265,1135,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,1122,367,1532,29899,524,2509,287,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":47394757855,"load_duration":307714,"prompt_eval_count":147,"prompt_eval_duration":17042571000,"eval_count":213,"eval_duration":30351329000}
