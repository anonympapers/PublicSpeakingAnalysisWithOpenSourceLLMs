{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T01:07:36.908245723Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning, but there are also some areas where the argumentation could be strengthened.\n\nThe speaker presents their research question and objectives clearly and concisely, which is a strong start. However, there are some points in the transcript where the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for the topic come across as overly simplistic or naive, which could undermine the persuasiveness of their argument. For example, the speaker says \"si cette image vous parrez aujourd'hui bizarre, dis-sis quelques années, elle vous paraîtra tout à fait normal\" (if this image seems strange to you today, just wait a few years and it will seem completely normal). While the speaker is attempting to convey the idea that their perspective on children's behavior is groundbreaking and will become more accepted over time, this statement comes across as overly optimistic and lacks nuance.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could benefit from providing more evidence and logical reasoning to support their claims. For example, they mention that the image of children as \"différents des adultes\" (different from adults) is a common perception, but they do not provide any data or research to back up this claim. By providing more concrete examples and evidence, the speaker could make their argument more persuasive and convincing.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for the topic come across as persuasive, there are also some areas where the argumentation could be strengthened with more evidence and logical reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,980,10628,277,316,454,9122,2923,29948,1745,358,553,16157,267,29889,1459,263,26231,29892,11797,3435,316,5162,2923,1792,270,29915,2559,586,362,782,2757,868,1701,7598,29889,478,681,301,29915,6698,26477,12866,7199,275,29892,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,634,316,7199,9030,425,639,1441,553,21038,818,301,29915,2445,538,316,5278,544,15819,29892,18934,270,29915,424,790,29875,546,634,270,29915,562,2388,18303,10713,29378,1558,787,20299,882,2122,29889,6803,2257,9073,29892,1444,1539,29879,301,29915,348,21285,270,29915,296,2267,819,2535,553,21038,316,29871,29953,818,29871,29906,6063,634,7907,966,11469,1301,9695,29892,7015,2637,2034,575,8556,14924,509,609,610,425,9460,316,1437,371,312,261,29889,2664,2114,11620,3435,269,14069,2406,29892,11643,1189,3783,634,9257,26020,589,9318,6267,1436,634,6267,17385,362,29889,838,943,1354,1444,16623,5646,29871,4277,29892,634,712,1444,3516,575,22572,29915,15669,1671,7890,454,1153,535,357,29892,274,29915,342,925,29872,1671,7890,2970,712,1671,1597,3814,12973,29892,20244,634,1411,519,454,9122,1634,1893,2231,925,29872,16731,29889,8748,1354,5278,1967,7890,610,15749,22572,29915,15669,289,15356,276,29892,766,29899,29879,275,13545,8595,29892,4875,7890,760,7848,818,5646,818,5246,4226,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,1576,25657,22981,1009,5925,1139,322,1203,3145,9436,322,3022,275,873,29892,607,338,263,4549,1369,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,3291,297,278,1301,924,988,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,322,15935,363,278,11261,2041,4822,408,975,368,5466,4695,470,1055,573,29892,607,1033,563,837,457,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2980,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,4083,376,1039,5278,1967,7890,610,15749,22572,29915,15669,289,15356,276,29892,766,29899,29879,275,13545,8595,29892,4875,7890,1702,30058,3018,5646,818,5246,4226,29908,313,361,445,1967,2444,8515,304,366,9826,29892,925,4480,263,2846,2440,322,372,674,2833,6446,4226,467,5806,278,25657,338,15661,304,27769,278,2969,393,1009,18520,373,4344,29915,29879,6030,338,5962,1030,5086,322,674,4953,901,9259,975,931,29892,445,3229,5304,4822,408,975,368,5994,4695,322,425,4684,4948,749,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,14169,515,13138,901,10757,322,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,278,1967,310,4344,408,376,12765,1064,1237,553,16157,267,29908,313,29881,15622,515,16157,29879,29897,338,263,3619,639,1441,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,848,470,5925,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,2648,13138,901,18387,6455,322,10757,29892,278,25657,1033,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,322,15935,363,278,11261,2041,4822,408,20408,294,573,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,411,901,10757,322,16667,24481,29889],"total_duration":66388390020,"load_duration":255467,"prompt_eval_count":254,"prompt_eval_duration":21364155000,"eval_count":370,"eval_duration":45023430000}
