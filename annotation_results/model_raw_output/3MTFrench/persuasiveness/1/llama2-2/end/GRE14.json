{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T12:23:34.559277546Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 (moderately persuasive) for the speech in this instance. Here's why:\n\n1. Reasoning: The speaker provides some reasoning to support their claims, such as the correlation between Xilan and water incorporation for obtaining resistant granulates. However, their reasoning is not rigorous enough, as they do not provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying mechanisms or offer any empirical evidence to back up their claims.\n2. Persuasive appeal: The speaker does not use a strong emotional appeal or storytelling to persuade the audience. They simply present their findings and suggestions without creating a compelling narrative or using rhetorical devices to engage the audience.\n3. Crafting of the message: While the speaker presents their findings in a clear and concise manner, they could have been more creative in how they present their message. The speech lacks a clear structure or organizing principle, which makes it feel disjointed at times.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does provide some valuable insights into their research, they could improve their persuasiveness by providing more rigorous reasoning and a more compelling presentation of their findings.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,404,15802,1671,8689,1354,29871,4277,18165,484,29889,2581,3667,895,1597,325,336,347,3965,29874,3803,352,1318,21136,1808,29892,634,1671,12694,1237,4768,290,5793,29892,1444,16623,1197,29948,29889,997,7175,862,362,553,1775,29038,29892,454,1841,3820,482,316,611,4933,29892,634,1444,29188,425,4021,2131,553,3803,352,2406,29892,634,454,10814,18165,17239,316,1601,1889,29889,1720,343,263,2535,14984,7015,21880,29892,7890,4078,29920,2257,712,1444,1236,1314,9073,29889,2726,12997,3783,29892,432,29915,1794,270,29915,296,361,3955,619,264,2637,966,883,267,634,966,3581,280,1295,316,4883,4768,290,5793,29892,634,966,1841,3820,1179,712,1444,19760,3667,7608,1671,16219,381,553,3803,352,2406,1750,364,3906,2258,455,944,1465,1601,3710,9552,29889,29871,30219,29874,1766,1173,28185,9373,2331,4439,29889,2581,2906,23469,5178,5495,818,301,29915,283,275,868,28643,966,12997,3783,29889,1459,17488,29892,432,29915,1794,1083,279,17851,712,454,1060,309,273,29892,443,553,5541,1934,3420,2993,316,4883,4768,290,5793,29892,634,5162,882,27760,3610,1318,2535,301,29915,14531,712,1444,19760,11039,261,1671,16219,381,553,3803,352,2406,6896,391,1934,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,2331,868,5646,544,1975,7252,7674,21136,1808,29889,6803,425,9460,316,611,266,17449,29892,432,29915,9983,1908,534,8885,270,29915,14559,992,583,270,29915,20640,4371,1671,712,301,29915,265,2653,5582,818,20689,29892,2258,455,944,3667,7608,14984,7015,13745,1279,3783,1750,8556,875,7771,29889,349,4664,802,274,29915,342,29871,4277,29892,454,3464,1314,29889,897,1601,1437,284,283,275,1750,7890,12468,1808,966,26809,29889,405,359,25698,19503,3435,7848,925,29872,1437,1324,1314,270,29915,23578,1934,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,313,1545,261,2486,20408,294,573,29897,363,278,12032,297,445,2777,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,830,1658,292,29901,450,25657,8128,777,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,278,19869,1546,1060,309,273,322,4094,11039,362,363,4017,292,9241,424,3803,352,1078,29889,2398,29892,1009,24481,338,451,12912,20657,3307,29892,408,896,437,451,3867,263,15171,6270,8252,310,278,14407,7208,12903,470,5957,738,29190,936,10757,304,1250,701,1009,16726,29889,13,29906,29889,9034,29884,294,573,25530,29901,450,25657,947,451,671,263,4549,23023,1848,25530,470,5828,29873,7807,304,20408,1943,278,20026,29889,2688,3763,2198,1009,1284,886,322,10529,1728,4969,263,752,7807,15474,1230,470,773,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,3033,482,278,20026,29889,13,29941,29889,315,4154,292,310,278,2643,29901,5806,278,25657,22981,1009,1284,886,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,896,1033,505,1063,901,907,1230,297,920,896,2198,1009,2643,29889,450,12032,425,4684,263,2821,3829,470,2894,5281,12502,29892,607,3732,372,4459,766,12090,287,472,3064,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,3867,777,21114,1663,5861,964,1009,5925,29892,896,1033,11157,1009,20408,294,20193,491,13138,901,12912,20657,24481,322,263,901,752,7807,24329,310,1009,1284,886,29889],"total_duration":124937036115,"load_duration":250152,"prompt_eval_count":343,"prompt_eval_duration":30693832000,"eval_count":273,"eval_duration":94242400000}
