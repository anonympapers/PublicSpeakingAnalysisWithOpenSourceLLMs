{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T18:06:14.006021956Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker is not very convincing in their argumentation. They make some general statements without providing sufficient evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims. For example, they say \"Je veux savoir si la brie rouge se fixe plutôt sur la brie\" without explaining how they plan to observe the interactions within the enzyme or what specific research questions they aim to answer.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is not rigorous enough, as they make some ambiguous statements and lack clarity in their arguments. For instance, they say \"Alors, de vous, à moi, je ne suis pas prête à abandonner le Lego,\" without explaining what \"le Lego\" represents or why they are unwilling to abandon it.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some enthusiasm and passion for their research, they need to work on developing more persuasive and rigorous arguments to effectively convey their message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,592,544,4637,6773,13933,12563,6267,6316,29889,8748,274,29915,342,1671,29871,29896,29941,29899,29896,29941,6063,29892,19601,29892,1444,592,12789,284,5582,1190,454,1889,375,270,29915,11236,362,316,15093,427,29920,603,29889,422,1004,301,29915,326,1030,2543,347,316,425,10415,15104,29892,18402,3669,854,29884,6303,316,1601,427,29920,603,707,904,2034,339,1318,316,610,1597,3581,20519,16530,5289,29889,6803,18729,29892,432,29915,4422,895,425,3279,29920,29899,13453,29884,1064,1318,1647,1750,1506,347,270,29915,348,694,381,29889,1632,20032,818,29871,4277,29892,1444,1236,1314,2258,455,944,22944,1601,427,29920,603,1465,425,3038,1297,2535,443,20710,1883,4338,29889,2581,2453,1314,4048,6390,1354,425,1506,347,16053,479,409,2329,29872,28185,9373,1190,425,1506,347,29889,435,29915,264,263,2298,11172,1190,425,10767,29884,29889,4231,6311,29892,1354,373,18331,818,7199,9030,966,22060,427,2757,316,15093,427,29920,603,29892,373,1671,8356,425,1354,569,23068,818,553,10283,293,20060,634,8288,439,29915,14056,23778,966,3435,18165,1860,427,29920,603,1098,3783,29889,1105,277,1671,454,20436,8584,29892,12852,1671,301,29915,262,747,300,29889,838,943,29892,316,7890,29892,818,19601,29892,1444,452,26099,2331,544,9061,818,11807,1089,454,365,2412,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,338,451,1407,17953,3277,297,1009,2980,362,29889,2688,1207,777,2498,9506,1728,13138,8002,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1827,376,13836,2453,1314,4048,6390,1354,425,1506,347,16053,479,409,2329,29872,28185,9373,1190,425,1506,347,29908,1728,24232,920,896,3814,304,14111,278,22060,2629,278,427,14022,29872,470,825,2702,5925,5155,896,12242,304,1234,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,12912,20657,3307,29892,408,896,1207,777,22363,681,9506,322,10225,7542,537,297,1009,6273,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,1827,376,2499,943,29892,316,7890,29892,818,19601,29892,1444,452,26099,2331,544,9061,818,11807,1089,454,365,2412,1699,1728,24232,825,376,280,365,2412,29908,11524,470,2020,896,526,18500,8873,304,11807,372,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,23644,3173,29885,322,15935,363,1009,5925,29892,896,817,304,664,373,14338,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,6273,304,17583,27769,1009,2643,29889],"total_duration":66879016566,"load_duration":294154,"prompt_eval_count":253,"prompt_eval_duration":29954908000,"eval_count":248,"eval_duration":36923269000}
