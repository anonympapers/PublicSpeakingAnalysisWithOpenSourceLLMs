{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T18:10:14.591636657Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give the speech a score of 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker presents some valid points about the advantages of using the Simon traditional as a building material, such as its durability and resistance to fire. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's argument that the Simon traditional is the \"colle à plus résistante\" (most resistant glue) is based solely on anecdotal evidence and personal experience, rather than any scientific or empirical evidence. While it is true that the Simon traditional has been used for centuries and has a proven track record of durability, it would be more persuasive to provide data or studies that support this claim.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's assertion that a new, ecological version of the Simon traditional will be developed in the future is speculative and lacks detail. While it is possible that advances in technology could lead to the development of a more environmentally friendly version of the Simon traditional, it is unclear how this would work or when it might happen. Providing more information on the timeline and potential mechanisms for developing such a material would make the argument more convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some valid points about the advantages of the Simon traditional, there are areas where the reasoning could be strengthened to make the argument more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,289,787,626,275,3817,29879,2637,9932,634,15096,29892,2123,1671,17161,261,7847,1190,18249,18097,6701,544,29145,5198,711,2638,743,3691,1179,316,1671,29871,29941,29900,6063,29892,29871,29896,29899,29896,29900,899,431,793,29889,8748,5695,29871,29896,29899,29896,29900,899,431,793,29892,316,325,713,311,619,575,2637,7814,4239,16530,20564,29892,443,275,818,18413,610,1597,4889,4805,536,21735,29889,315,29915,342,23068,818,5278,4889,712,454,11254,707,425,23056,818,2298,6896,391,1647,378,535,29874,895,29892,712,2257,25574,1750,29892,10440,316,25927,8997,712,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,818,610,1358,29889,2581,26099,269,30095,29878,439,29915,348,8694,29892,373,564,3511,29874,818,13942,29877,2496,1597,15217,5960,749,1750,1766,1173,316,425,6701,2258,15529,712,454,11254,11399,9139,29892,3503,21394,11387,1248,12361,818,1391,533,29889,1551,263,2002,8532,443,11254,904,21553,1387,634,274,29915,342,2535,2257,11254,712,8556,6787,533,787,1465,4883,6063,29892,7814,4213,267,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,278,12032,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,25486,310,773,278,11254,13807,408,263,5214,5518,29892,1316,408,967,1411,3097,322,17711,304,3974,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,11254,13807,338,278,376,1054,280,818,2298,6896,391,1647,29908,313,3242,9241,424,3144,434,29897,338,2729,14419,368,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,7271,29892,3265,1135,738,16021,470,29190,936,10757,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,278,11254,13807,756,1063,1304,363,21726,322,756,263,16413,5702,2407,310,1411,3097,29892,372,723,367,901,20408,294,573,304,3867,848,470,11898,393,2304,445,5995,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,263,716,29892,321,21553,936,1873,310,278,11254,13807,674,367,8906,297,278,5434,338,1580,28524,322,425,4684,9493,29889,5806,372,338,1950,393,3061,2925,297,15483,1033,3275,304,278,5849,310,263,901,5177,635,19780,1873,310,278,11254,13807,29892,372,338,20871,920,445,723,664,470,746,372,1795,3799,29889,9133,4821,901,2472,373,278,5335,5570,322,7037,7208,12903,363,14338,1316,263,5518,723,1207,278,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,25486,310,278,11254,13807,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,9324,6419,304,1207,278,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":70907443032,"load_duration":190701,"prompt_eval_count":202,"prompt_eval_duration":24180014000,"eval_count":312,"eval_duration":46726672000}
