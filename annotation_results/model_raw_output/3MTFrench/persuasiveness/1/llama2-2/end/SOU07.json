{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T10:16:58.166859724Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using simple language and relatable examples to make their point. However, they lack depth and nuance in their analysis, which hinders their ability to persuade the audience. They do not provide a comprehensive explanation of the scientific concepts they are discussing, and their arguments could benefit from more detail and evidence.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is generally sound, but there are some instances where they oversimplify complex ideas or ignore potential counterarguments. For example, they do not address the possibility of genetic variation within a population or the challenges of detecting a single gene mutation in a complex disease like intellectual disability. Additionally, their reliance on anecdotal evidence and non-peer-reviewed research may undermine the credibility of their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's passion and conviction are evident throughout the speech, they could benefit from more rigorous scientific analysis and a more comprehensive understanding of the complex issues at hand.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,349,5818,425,8861,8691,316,611,266,17449,29892,432,29915,1794,5246,4239,521,15806,24151,29889,1588,4193,12784,29892,1444,7890,7468,6309,712,425,5478,362,1465,443,20536,330,8146,9378,277,1671,3269,261,425,4439,328,347,29889,11948,373,452,8164,2331,9073,5646,443,527,13732,439,29915,1808,1518,4894,663,818,323,305,3610,290,1671,301,29915,1893,566,631,29889,838,943,432,29915,1794,2893,29792,2257,6701,330,8146,29892,3503,14255,425,29442,1173,29889,853,20744,29892,427,4768,5458,29892,373,3667,895,18484,425,29442,1173,427,11172,439,29915,6388,6386,878,15340,29889,26079,9397,12784,13483,29892,432,29915,1794,5246,12694,1237,1518,4894,2063,14255,425,29442,1173,634,432,29915,1794,2893,29792,553,6062,29948,21337,805,4582,361,3783,1750,269,29915,496,398,352,296,13260,8501,29892,925,882,18097,454,330,8146,297,6578,1893,291,12242,277,1249,29889,4241,841,424,29892,432,29915,404,15802,316,8689,1354,274,29915,342,9541,309,14255,301,29915,21708,29889,2581,26099,9953,424,868,439,29915,309,343,263,5278,10098,29899,455,29892,553,4047,375,1750,1326,23510,868,13625,29892,553,22069,634,1444,966,7252,2535,553,480,27499,13625,29889,2664,5216,7545,6062,29948,21337,4555,1444,7890,610,280,29892,454,269,29915,932,1808,29892,1437,571,351,358,270,29915,1466,1597,316,1301,29886,1908,634,22572,29915,15669,29892,11797,1863,296,553,5722,11763,1671,966,1437,371,312,261,1465,454,13625,29889,12660,371,312,261,1597,11482,1654,663,18715,13498,25810,18413,5695,2560,712,553,1437,371,312,743,427,364,2017,29889,11948,23068,782,4768,290,279,446,332,868,3105,332,29892,373,8164,3948,30037,357,316,1261,3825,454,17887,946,29892,454,19493,261,1597,316,22754,8284,1295,818,553,21038,316,6809,424,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,322,1104,17219,6455,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,2398,29892,896,10225,10809,322,4948,749,297,1009,7418,29892,607,298,513,414,1009,11509,304,20408,1943,278,20026,29889,2688,437,451,3867,263,15171,6270,8252,310,278,16021,22001,896,526,5353,292,29892,322,1009,6273,1033,14169,515,901,9493,322,10757,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,6892,6047,29892,541,727,526,777,8871,988,896,288,874,13699,1598,4280,7014,470,11455,7037,6795,25699,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,437,451,3211,278,13331,310,2531,7492,19262,2629,263,4665,470,278,18066,267,310,6459,292,263,2323,18530,5478,362,297,263,4280,17135,763,29762,766,3097,29889,19814,29892,1009,12536,749,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,1661,29899,412,261,29899,27828,287,5925,1122,563,837,457,278,6625,4127,310,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,7602,2463,526,13602,10106,278,12032,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,16021,7418,322,263,901,15171,6270,8004,310,278,4280,5626,472,1361,29889],"total_duration":65091029054,"load_duration":257235,"prompt_eval_count":348,"prompt_eval_duration":29566194000,"eval_count":272,"eval_duration":35524001000}
