The speaker presents some interesting ideas and methods for studying seismic waves, but there are some areas where their argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's argument is not very clear and concise. They jump between different topics such as the study of seismic waves, the movement of Mongols-fire, and the resistance of barrages hydroelectric without providing a clear connection between them. This makes it difficult for the listener to follow their train of thought and evaluate their argument effectively.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker mentions some interesting methods for studying seismic waves, they do not provide enough detail or evidence to support their claims. For example, they mention that the ondes seismiques propagate in a similar manner to the propagation of sound waves in water, but they do not explain how this is possible or what specific factors influence this propagation.\n\nLastly, the speaker's argument lacks a clear conclusion or call to action. They present their ideas without fully explaining their implications or how they could be applied in practice. This makes it difficult for the listener to understand the practical relevance of the speaker's research or how it could be used to solve real-world problems.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas and methods, their argument could benefit from greater clarity, detail, and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,7890,26427,29920,269,30095,276,358,3503,3440,2947,29899,29873,29899,309,534,8885,1597,2280,1465,443,2432,9874,29338,316,13547,25902,1577,382,29882,6079,966,8774,386,2631,712,1444,13942,29877,4798,872,13219,30057,412,610,5444,17334,818,301,29915,1893,1151,553,7019,1608,267,29889,11044,388,787,316,7199,9030,29892,425,4303,10500,316,301,29915,13469,316,18402,610,301,29915,24516,359,291,29892,872,610,2016,818,425,4303,10500,270,29915,898,267,409,1608,3783,610,443,7019,6386,29889,12390,373,2783,409,1608,3783,409,13089,296,18158,1465,425,5061,276,14864,553,658,275,1027,309,7147,818,425,13089,362,316,301,29915,13469,316,18402,1465,301,29915,14531,29889,1174,4951,29892,425,2123,301,29915,24516,359,291,409,23585,443,282,627,29872,443,5898,29899,3034,262,29892,454,7019,6386,3911,29892,443,282,627,29872,1597,8441,2123,443,21592,2073,29889,2664,7019,1608,267,452,3435,439,29915,348,17488,29892,3503,23520,29871,4277,2947,5695,1465,301,29915,1893,1151,868,25924,553,21952,3775,29899,29888,6349,29892,2123,10440,316,425,6896,21558,553,2594,1179,17546,15436,2200,29889,8748,1750,872,277,29892,8164,29899,5474,439,29915,348,8694,29892,7814,17124,6609,724,609,4191,2257,977,542,271,1671,454,9200,898,267,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,3519,363,23382,409,1608,293,20037,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,451,1407,2821,322,3022,895,29889,2688,12500,1546,1422,23820,1316,408,278,6559,310,409,1608,293,20037,29892,278,10298,310,21952,3775,29899,8696,29892,322,278,17711,310,2594,22428,17546,15436,2200,1728,13138,263,2821,3957,1546,963,29889,910,3732,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,322,14707,1009,2980,17583,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,777,8031,3519,363,23382,409,1608,293,20037,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,9493,470,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,278,373,2783,409,1608,3783,13089,403,297,263,2788,8214,304,278,13089,362,310,6047,20037,297,4094,29892,541,896,437,451,5649,920,445,338,1950,470,825,2702,13879,9949,445,13089,362,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,425,4684,263,2821,15997,470,1246,304,3158,29889,2688,2198,1009,7014,1728,8072,24232,1009,2411,5795,470,920,896,1033,367,7436,297,6944,29889,910,3732,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,2274,278,15031,29527,749,310,278,25657,29915,29879,5925,470,920,372,1033,367,1304,304,4505,1855,29899,11526,4828,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,3519,29892,1009,2980,1033,14169,515,7621,7542,537,29892,9493,29892,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":77293863161,"load_duration":189099,"prompt_eval_count":253,"prompt_eval_duration":30254672000,"eval_count":317,"eval_duration":47038456000}
