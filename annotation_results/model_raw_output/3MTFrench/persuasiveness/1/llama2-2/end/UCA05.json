{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T02:42:15.927467237Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker is not very effective in crafting a convincing message and their reasoning is not rigorous. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of clarity: The speaker often uses vague terms like \"enlever\" and \"dédirecteur\" without providing clear explanations or examples. This makes it difficult for the audience to understand what they are trying to convey.\n2. Misuse of technical terms: The speaker uses technical terms like \"3-4-méditage\" and \"7-4-méditage\" without explaining their meaning or significance. This can come across as pretentious or confusing to the audience.\n3. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes claims about the effectiveness of certain actions without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support them. For example, they claim that \"il a plus à l'île\" after removing something from a 3-4-méditage tool, but do not provide any explanation as to why this is the case.\n4. Inconsistent logic: The speaker's logic appears to be inconsistent at times, with some statements making sense and others being confusing or contradictory. For example, they claim that \"la reconnaissance du dédirecteur et d'une attraction dolante\" is necessary for success, but then later argue that \"on va aller t'enlever dans le 2-3-médit\".\n\nOverall, while the speaker may have some valid points, their message is not persuasive due to the lack of clarity, misuse of technical terms, and inconsistent logic.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,838,943,29892,818,7175,29899,3859,818,1791,276,19844,2257,439,29915,309,343,263,29892,7890,316,13325,623,7367,301,29915,449,309,868,29871,29941,29899,29946,29899,29885,2487,16639,868,25179,492,7289,316,269,4987,316,425,7175,29899,3859,29889,838,943,29892,2257,1750,707,610,8714,316,269,29915,264,5083,284,2131,358,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,264,280,369,29889,2860,1597,10098,712,5291,302,29915,264,29880,30000,1960,2298,2123,818,443,8638,316,29871,29941,29899,29885,2487,16639,29892,980,263,2298,818,301,29915,26917,29889,1174,5246,29892,425,25238,9948,868,29871,29955,29899,29946,29899,29885,2487,16639,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,27423,316,2504,759,29889,838,943,29892,2257,712,274,29915,342,29889,8748,12866,29892,373,2947,16454,260,29915,264,280,369,1465,454,29871,29906,29899,29941,29899,29885,2487,277,29892,427,5969,2039,712,425,25238,9948,868,1437,11851,5411,634,270,29915,1540,1098,13857,8828,1647,634,868,2298,5162,29889,1720,234,188,160,993,1597,263,680,818,7931,1230,7113,29889,1704,7890,8992,29920,925,29872,26814,4788,29920,29899,352,2637,425,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,338,451,1407,11828,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,322,1009,24481,338,451,12912,20657,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,29901,450,25657,4049,3913,25160,4958,763,376,264,280,369,29908,322,376,29881,2487,1088,5411,29908,1728,13138,2821,7309,800,470,6455,29889,910,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,2274,825,896,526,1811,304,27769,29889,13,29906,29889,20929,1509,310,16905,4958,29901,450,25657,3913,16905,4958,763,376,29941,29899,29946,29899,29885,2487,16639,29908,322,376,29955,29899,29946,29899,29885,2487,16639,29908,1728,24232,1009,6593,470,26002,29889,910,508,2041,4822,408,14794,296,2738,470,16051,304,278,20026,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,3058,8820,1728,13138,738,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,963,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,376,309,263,2298,818,301,29915,26917,29908,1156,11077,1554,515,263,29871,29941,29899,29946,29899,29885,2487,16639,5780,29892,541,437,451,3867,738,8252,408,304,2020,445,338,278,1206,29889,13,29946,29889,512,3200,9696,5900,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,5900,5692,304,367,22435,9696,472,3064,29892,411,777,9506,3907,4060,322,4045,1641,16051,470,27877,706,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,376,433,25238,9948,868,1437,11851,5411,634,270,29915,1540,1098,13857,8828,1647,29908,338,5181,363,2551,29892,541,769,2678,27754,393,376,265,2947,16454,260,29915,264,280,369,1465,454,29871,29906,29899,29941,29899,29885,2487,277,1642,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1122,505,777,2854,3291,29892,1009,2643,338,451,20408,294,573,2861,304,278,10225,310,7542,537,29892,3984,1509,310,16905,4958,29892,322,22435,9696,5900,29889],"total_duration":71304196869,"load_duration":177888,"prompt_eval_count":220,"prompt_eval_duration":22943031000,"eval_count":361,"eval_duration":48360389000}
