The speaker presents a novel approach to detecting all living organisms in the ocean using DNA from environmental samples, which could potentially lead to a more efficient and effective method for studying marine biodiversity. However, the argument could be strengthened by providing more detailed explanations of the methodology and potential applications of the research.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is somewhat rigorous, but there are some areas where more detail and explanation could help to build a stronger case. For example, it would be helpful to provide more information on how the DNA is extracted from the environmental samples, how the young pressis are identified, and how the cartography of marine biodiversity is created. Additionally, the speaker could benefit from providing more context and evidence to support their claims about the importance of studying marine biodiversity and the potential applications of their research.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents an interesting and potentially groundbreaking approach to studying marine biodiversity, there are areas where they could improve the persuasiveness of their argument by providing more detail and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,274,29915,342,712,454,9200,29899,6078,269,29915,932,28759,868,8714,29889,8748,373,263,3008,28230,868,8774,386,356,2298,25595,1671,16454,818,425,6701,325,3246,344,712,301,29915,20041,2546,29889,838,943,1465,611,266,17449,29892,432,29915,20640,895,1597,15217,2134,1173,29892,2298,6366,815,1559,4875,14924,316,1437,371,312,261,5646,301,29915,279,1030,868,9364,424,29889,435,29915,4422,895,425,25348,12471,17239,744,29892,712,432,29915,1062,8356,1513,882,316,425,16380,29872,633,790,744,29889,1720,640,993,425,25348,316,14984,966,5697,3246,289,22730,1750,9364,296,29889,2581,1072,19755,18158,553,29026,3965,275,553,29026,427,3817,818,9411,966,2894,1608,267,9364,1934,29889,7740,787,818,19601,634,818,4875,29889,12390,29026,409,3435,553,29026,11561,29899,1646,690,1750,19172,296,427,966,4224,397,1934,270,29915,25378,966,5152,17893,5814,5326,29889,1632,20032,818,5278,15217,8774,386,356,29892,427,3483,952,424,553,289,17718,633,790,2122,7175,2608,743,760,449,1465,454,9122,29892,1444,2181,1318,1597,7774,4437,316,425,289,2660,1536,2131,316,7814,22114,29899,689,267,1766,1144,29889,997,10928,9874,263,6309,29892,373,263,18484,3008,28230,270,29915,348,2298,17887,712,577,262,29889,405,681,2906,787,343,427,2123,29890,30057,1912,553,6896,5326,938,342,979,267,3435,3686,7268,4999,818,24145,6316,29889,838,943,29892,12468,295,787,29899,29876,681,712,2257,282,1082,29899,455,712,577,262,29892,980,8164,7848,2299,790,744,634,17512,2445,291,484,7814,883,2749,1144,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,9554,2948,304,6459,292,599,8471,2894,12903,297,278,23474,773,25348,515,29380,11916,29892,607,1033,19998,3275,304,263,901,8543,322,11828,1158,363,23382,23585,289,2660,24974,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,13173,7309,800,310,278,1158,3002,322,7037,8324,310,278,5925,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,10579,12912,20657,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,901,9493,322,8252,1033,1371,304,2048,263,23505,1206,29889,1152,1342,29892,372,723,367,8444,304,3867,901,2472,373,920,278,25348,338,23892,515,278,29380,11916,29892,920,278,4123,3965,275,526,15659,29892,322,920,278,7774,5275,310,23585,289,2660,24974,338,2825,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,14169,515,13138,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,13500,310,23382,23585,289,2660,24974,322,278,7037,8324,310,1009,5925,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,385,8031,322,19998,5962,1030,5086,2948,304,23382,23585,289,2660,24974,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2980,491,13138,901,9493,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":66521484459,"load_duration":256747,"prompt_eval_count":308,"prompt_eval_duration":32469889000,"eval_count":250,"eval_duration":34050729000}
