Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker provides some interesting insights into the complexity of the relationship between insects and bacteria, which shows that they have a good understanding of the topic.\n2. They use appropriate scientific terms and concepts, such as \"ADN\" and \"bact√©rien,\" which suggests that they have a solid grasp of the subject matter.\n3. The speaker provides some data and evidence to support their argument, such as the results of their experiments with roundworms and bacteria.\n4. However, there are some areas where the speaker could improve in terms of presenting their argument more persuasively:\n\na. At times, the speaker's delivery can come across as a bit dry and factual, without much emotional appeal or connection with the audience.\nb. The speaker could have done more to explain why their research is important and how it can contribute to solving real-world problems.\nc. While the speaker provides some data and evidence, they could have gone into more detail and provided more specific examples to support their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents some interesting insights, there are areas where they could improve in terms of presenting their argument in a more persuasive and engaging manner.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,610,1094,2049,680,29889,3872,29883,1671,18729,29892,432,29915,1062,8356,6267,11033,29940,634,1444,1072,19755,1354,316,425,11033,29940,29892,289,627,4894,264,409,7090,1465,966,17564,267,29889,1174,13495,29892,432,29915,6388,895,443,15499,29892,2298,24627,8474,2331,1094,2049,680,1465,1597,1045,30058,371,316,282,18949,347,634,1444,16731,966,2298,24627,610,1094,277,1318,29889,2581,16623,18729,1671,553,2298,24627,1750,610,553,289,627,29948,2722,634,553,2298,24627,1750,302,29915,264,14931,2331,29889,8407,2186,29892,432,29915,1794,1601,509,29948,439,29915,1540,20319,316,2298,24627,6303,5162,882,17512,2445,1318,610,553,289,627,29948,2722,29889,3872,29883,425,410,5815,457,904,941,412,29892,274,29915,342,316,8689,1354,966,6458,793,1437,2608,2406,553,480,267,610,1459,1094,2049,680,15390,316,640,473,1089,425,6896,21558,868,1094,277,29899,29933,5761,29875,29889,3872,29883,5278,298,6844,29892,274,29915,342,443,17488,316,425,4280,2131,868,619,264,29889,1551,2453,329,1083,13974,2265,553,282,15931,2247,610,553,17564,267,29892,610,29888,1249,29892,3503,373,409,7697,16731,712,454,20067,2470,707,409,1539,1465,289,987,29889,8748,12866,274,29915,342,1671,18729,712,301,29915,265,263,3008,28230,316,14954,1173,1295,4191,19601,2535,443,282,20752,1465,425,13219,7661,634,443,282,20752,1465,425,544,15819,29889,341,5093,1354,980,6427,8284,1190,553,480,27499,5695,1190,544,27153,712,553,289,627,29948,2722,316,2298,24627,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,1009,2980,297,263,12912,20657,8214,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,13644,310,278,9443,1546,17564,29879,322,289,5761,423,29892,607,3697,393,896,505,263,1781,8004,310,278,11261,29889,13,29906,29889,2688,671,8210,16021,4958,322,22001,29892,1316,408,376,3035,29940,29908,322,376,29890,627,4894,264,1699,607,14661,393,896,505,263,7773,25274,310,278,4967,4383,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,8128,777,848,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,1316,408,278,2582,310,1009,15729,411,4513,29893,555,29879,322,289,5761,423,29889,13,29946,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,297,4958,310,2198,292,1009,2980,901,20408,294,3598,29901,13,13,29874,29889,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,508,2041,4822,408,263,2586,15589,322,2114,950,29892,1728,1568,23023,1848,25530,470,3957,411,278,20026,29889,13,29890,29889,450,25657,1033,505,2309,901,304,5649,2020,1009,5925,338,4100,322,920,372,508,29126,304,17069,1855,29899,11526,4828,29889,13,29883,29889,5806,278,25657,8128,777,848,322,10757,29892,896,1033,505,7695,964,901,9493,322,4944,901,2702,6455,304,2304,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,9004,1078,263,1781,8004,310,278,11261,322,22981,777,8031,1663,5861,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,297,4958,310,2198,292,1009,2980,297,263,901,20408,294,573,322,3033,6751,8214,29889],"total_duration":156914810217,"load_duration":220715,"prompt_eval_count":296,"prompt_eval_duration":35957146000,"eval_count":320,"eval_duration":120956039000}
