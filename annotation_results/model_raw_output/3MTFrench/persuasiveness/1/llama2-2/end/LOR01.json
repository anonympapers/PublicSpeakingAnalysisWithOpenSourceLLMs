The speaker provides some interesting insights into the distribution and elimination of a molecule in the body, but their reasoning is not always rigorous and could benefit from more detail and evidence.\n\nThe speaker's main argument is that reducing contamination in food products is important for preserving consumer health, but they do not provide any concrete data or studies to support this claim. They also make some vague statements about the dangers of water and the importance of producing meat with low levels of contaminants, without explaining how these goals can be achieved.\n\nWhile the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for their work are evident, they could benefit from more structured thinking and a clearer articulation of their arguments. Additionally, some of the statements made in the transcript are not fully coherent or lack sufficient evidence to be persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows promise in their research and analysis, they need to work on presenting their ideas in a more clear, concise, and persuasive manner in order to effectively convey their message to a general audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,7175,2974,425,20877,29948,868,1136,3011,7289,29892,980,21668,12866,1841,700,533,425,640,314,3381,316,301,29915,24031,553,1391,1169,20196,7147,29889,8748,7890,454,1841,510,558,26477,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,2298,16530,20564,3479,5697,1169,1302,305,787,29892,274,29915,342,818,2970,818,425,6316,1509,316,14931,29889,435,29915,404,15802,316,7199,9030,3440,425,6062,29948,1810,29948,22965,434,634,1465,301,29915,6388,6386,634,3440,4875,427,707,904,2576,262,1318,29889,26383,2257,1601,1203,361,634,316,6787,533,443,878,15340,5844,2249,15819,316,6782,29873,29892,19172,424,316,544,2487,533,966,14953,800,1465,301,29915,1893,277,434,782,9587,868,8714,29889,26383,2257,878,15340,29892,1444,1671,23469,8288,4048,6390,1465,25178,885,28951,454,24228,316,425,8825,1098,9030,454,1302,305,265,634,269,29915,309,301,29915,27601,29892,7594,760,309,767,479,424,316,7017,1577,29871,30219,29874,260,29915,22730,29892,1487,1701,347,2123,10440,1487,432,1117,265,29889,7747,18848,19172,336,316,5178,5495,966,904,280,345,1295,1190,966,544,19669,818,594,19959,18934,316,2485,1524,454,6958,2535,2257,4595,8774,13775,301,29915,14531,29892,316,1391,533,2535,553,302,573,2993,316,3711,276,316,1826,302,29915,342,2298,2362,1950,634,316,5178,5495,966,23093,1190,966,13973,868,1302,305,265,818,10019,1524,29889,1459,346,712,2257,1750,707,427,260,1789,29892,29202,29892,5646,302,29915,342,2331,363,29883,15471,10814,1465,454,1302,305,265,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,4978,322,29007,3381,310,263,13206,29883,1297,297,278,3573,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,322,1033,14169,515,901,9493,322,10757,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,1667,2980,338,393,27668,640,314,3381,297,9687,9316,338,4100,363,2225,29530,21691,9045,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,848,470,11898,304,2304,445,5995,29889,2688,884,1207,777,25160,9506,1048,278,270,13873,310,4094,322,278,13500,310,20811,27654,411,4482,11174,310,640,9103,1934,29892,1728,24232,920,1438,14433,508,367,14363,29889,13,13,8809,488,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,322,15935,363,1009,664,526,13602,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,2281,2955,7291,322,263,26135,1616,293,2785,310,1009,6273,29889,19814,29892,777,310,278,9506,1754,297,278,1301,924,526,451,8072,16165,261,296,470,10225,8002,10757,304,367,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,11640,297,1009,5925,322,7418,29892,896,817,304,664,373,2198,292,1009,7014,297,263,901,2821,29892,3022,895,29892,322,20408,294,573,8214,297,1797,304,17583,27769,1009,2643,304,263,2498,20026,29889],"total_duration":57064858011,"load_duration":172179,"prompt_eval_count":300,"prompt_eval_duration":25220228000,"eval_count":259,"eval_duration":31843932000}
