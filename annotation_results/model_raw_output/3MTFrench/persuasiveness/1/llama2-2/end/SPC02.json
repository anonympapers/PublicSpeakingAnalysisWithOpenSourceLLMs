{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T23:42:49.173642411Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 (moderately persuasive) for the speech's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker presents some interesting and novel insights into the biology of cancer cells, particularly the role of intégrines in the escalade process. This shows that the speaker has done some research and is knowledgeable about the topic.\n2. The speaker provides some evidence to support their claims, such as the correlation between the presence of intégrines and the ability of cancer cells to evade the immune system. This suggests that the speaker has a good understanding of the scientific literature on the topic.\n3. However, there are also some areas where the speech could be improved. For example:\n* The speaker sometimes uses technical terms without fully explaining them, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow their argument. For instance, the term \"intégrines\" is not defined in the transcript, and it would be helpful if the speaker provided a brief explanation of what they mean by this term.\n* The speaker makes some general statements about the potential impact of their research without providing enough detail or evidence to fully support these claims. For example, the statement that \"today we develop a new treatment, an immunotherapy\" is quite vague and could be more specific about what this treatment entails and how it will work.\n* The speaker also makes some assertions about the limitations of current treatments without providing enough evidence to support these claims. For example, the statement that \"coupures de courant, accueurs et tabaises\" are always too few on the terrain could be challenged by pointing out examples where these problems have been successfully addressed in other contexts.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting insights and evidence, there are also areas where they could improve their argumentation and provide more detail and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,1601,509,261,712,5278,18768,6635,2445,7661,27119,1249,818,1597,5190,1318,316,27188,3246,23662,15826,1465,301,29915,267,1052,1943,29889,1551,966,623,1808,634,301,29915,3888,455,415,29948,6896,1693,286,2249,14119,29889,6803,339,7768,301,29915,267,1052,1943,1577,1459,346,439,29915,2719,3435,20075,743,316,5697,3246,410,6772,1475,316,5697,1169,8182,305,10778,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,938,27083,457,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,3984,427,10019,5084,712,274,29915,14386,23068,818,7015,938,27083,1475,1750,409,6974,10978,818,269,29915,351,374,546,782,269,3610,29884,2003,4564,1064,895,1671,1597,10996,1437,509,29884,533,29889,12390,19313,29899,27048,29892,432,29915,1794,503,29966,29989,386,29989,29958,13375,3006,375,1671,454,23900,868,715,290,1004,29892,3503,20554,3435,325,23469,1671,270,29915,14559,508,22543,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,29948,1915,1181,455,415,29948,6896,1693,286,2249,14119,3435,15237,9201,7006,20081,1190,454,28439,29889,315,29915,342,1671,29871,4277,712,22572,29915,15669,8556,13942,29877,4798,443,13164,1020,17334,29892,1597,5198,348,1228,481,347,1671,966,1391,275,427,4595,5419,29889,7747,16933,2437,562,1760,29892,2331,544,30037,794,361,29892,3503,15087,649,1387,1671,966,4439,3076,20498,882,29889,7747,2947,439,29915,265,13618,9411,966,1248,1654,414,818,301,29915,267,1052,1943,634,8532,29892,25921,966,17103,1973,316,2085,424,29892,25921,966,1035,434,1973,634,427,4951,1224,966,4434,1759,267,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,313,1545,261,2486,20408,294,573,29897,363,278,12032,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,322,9554,1663,5861,964,278,4768,3002,310,23900,9101,29892,10734,278,6297,310,938,27083,1475,297,278,831,1052,1943,1889,29889,910,3697,393,278,25657,756,2309,777,5925,322,338,7134,519,1048,278,11261,29889,13,29906,29889,450,25657,8128,777,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,278,19869,1546,278,10122,310,938,27083,1475,322,278,11509,310,23900,9101,304,321,1564,311,278,5198,1540,1788,29889,910,14661,393,278,25657,756,263,1781,8004,310,278,16021,12845,373,278,11261,29889,13,29941,29889,2398,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,1342,29901,13,29930,450,25657,6041,3913,16905,4958,1728,8072,24232,963,29892,607,1122,1207,372,5189,363,1661,29899,735,546,1372,304,1101,1009,2980,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,1840,376,524,27083,1475,29908,338,451,3342,297,278,1301,924,29892,322,372,723,367,8444,565,278,25657,4944,263,11473,8252,310,825,896,2099,491,445,1840,29889,13,29930,450,25657,3732,777,2498,9506,1048,278,7037,10879,310,1009,5925,1728,13138,3307,9493,470,10757,304,8072,2304,1438,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,3229,393,376,27765,591,2693,263,716,14502,29892,385,5198,348,1228,27580,29908,338,3755,25160,322,1033,367,901,2702,1048,825,445,14502,875,2234,322,920,372,674,664,29889,13,29930,450,25657,884,3732,777,4974,1080,1048,278,27028,310,1857,7539,1860,1728,13138,3307,10757,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,3229,393,376,29883,1132,1973,316,2085,424,29892,1035,434,1295,634,4434,1759,267,29908,526,2337,2086,2846,373,278,28439,1033,367,18066,287,491,13330,714,6455,988,1438,4828,505,1063,8472,20976,297,916,3030,29879,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,1663,5861,322,10757,29892,727,526,884,10161,988,896,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,322,3867,901,9493,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":78661189494,"load_duration":283572,"prompt_eval_count":299,"prompt_eval_duration":25075889000,"eval_count":422,"eval_duration":53582374000}
