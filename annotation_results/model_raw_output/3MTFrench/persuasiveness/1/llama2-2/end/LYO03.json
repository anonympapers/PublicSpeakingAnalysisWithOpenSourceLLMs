{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T15:30:45.565531052Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and uses rhetorical devices to make their point, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of vivid imagery and metaphors to help the audience visualize the concept of \"portites\" and how they relate to the speaker's argument. For example, the comparison of the \"fabrique réticule homme\" to a \"small door\" that leads to a \"world\" is an effective way to convey the idea that these portites are not just random events, but rather a coherent system.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the argument that the construction of more portites will lead to a \"sortie\" of workers and calcium from the \"fabrique réticule homme\" is not fully developed. The speaker simply asserts that this will happen without providing any evidence or logical explanation for why this would occur.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument that the journey of \"mataise\" has come to an end and that the concept of portites is the key to understanding the phenomenon of aging is not fully clarified. While the speaker does provide some context and background information on the topic, they do not fully develop their argument or provide any concrete evidence to support their claim.\n\nOverall, while there are some strengths to the speech, there are also areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects this mixed evaluation of the speaker's argumentation.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6340,409,8323,316,425,14710,17449,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,25681,9061,29920,29899,4346,29875,443,17887,14426,634,7890,269,29915,2749,787,7015,4239,15159,414,21592,7862,2535,8570,29889,997,10135,14090,1841,29873,293,1297,14738,634,425,20757,590,1552,282,898,29878,1318,29889,8526,301,29915,524,14508,316,7015,4239,21592,7862,29892,553,28074,7545,22235,743,17137,409,8323,316,6267,18165,17239,29889,8748,7015,28074,7545,22235,743,17137,3435,20081,634,22458,5475,29892,1209,424,270,29915,348,21592,2073,818,301,29915,18288,427,18165,553,3008,29877,1144,316,425,3038,1297,6316,29889,315,29915,342,8288,712,7890,302,29915,29874,545,29920,2331,316,425,29845,1597,22577,14931,1190,425,10135,14090,1841,29873,293,1297,14738,634,5278,22577,14931,443,9122,29889,8748,29871,4277,5246,301,29915,29882,1478,1064,311,29884,634,14924,425,26558,553,28074,7545,22235,743,17137,29889,2598,13659,316,1243,270,29915,332,1171,15647,1189,2488,3503,427,10019,5084,439,29915,1351,29883,454,8714,29892,425,2778,453,1114,457,427,18332,425,7632,316,2298,427,2298,316,7015,2011,7719,11113,375,29889,7747,1750,263,1671,1136,29948,3068,29883,1597,29835,634,4158,361,553,19612,26536,634,15835,398,316,425,10135,14090,1841,29873,293,1297,14738,29892,409,5695,409,8265,1760,7771,782,19666,316,425,20757,590,1552,282,898,29878,1318,29889,1174,7945,424,443,289,3222,265,270,29915,647,3409,1934,29871,29896,29945,714,2167,1190,285,1485,344,29892,443,18085,3409,1934,29871,29896,29945,714,2167,1190,5227,7214,610,17488,29889,10016,1190,305,28411,29948,1089,29887,19971,1224,1487,1373,29876,5249,634,443,6316,453,11537,544,2249,1337,29948,316,425,3038,1297,29889,951,17775,316,286,532,895,269,29915,2749,9061,29871,1654,427,289,999,17161,29948,7209,875,9061,29892,274,29915,342,8164,29899,5474,2331,270,29915,2251,6311,1597,14931,1750,260,29915,29874,11113,434,29892,1750,707,425,1067,29948,1671,7199,9030,443,1374,1690,290,8146,29892,18679,4191,454,9122,29892,432,29915,1794,443,14738,634,454,6316,453,11537,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,1539,12451,943,304,1371,278,20026,7604,675,278,6964,310,376,637,3246,29908,322,920,896,29279,304,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,10230,310,278,376,16582,14090,1841,29873,293,1297,14738,29908,304,263,376,9278,3050,29908,393,11981,304,263,376,11526,29908,338,385,11828,982,304,27769,278,2969,393,1438,2011,3246,526,451,925,4036,4959,29892,541,3265,263,16165,261,296,1788,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,2980,393,278,7632,310,901,2011,3246,674,3275,304,263,376,6605,347,29908,310,17162,322,15835,398,515,278,376,16582,14090,1841,29873,293,1297,14738,29908,338,451,8072,8906,29889,450,25657,3763,408,643,1372,393,445,674,3799,1728,13138,738,10757,470,16667,8252,363,2020,445,723,6403,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,16342,310,376,29885,532,895,29908,756,2041,304,385,1095,322,393,278,6964,310,2011,3246,338,278,1820,304,8004,278,27791,265,310,946,292,338,451,8072,7542,2164,29889,5806,278,25657,947,3867,777,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,29892,896,437,451,8072,2693,1009,2980,470,3867,738,18387,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,9324,29879,304,278,12032,29892,727,526,884,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,445,12849,17983,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,362,29889],"total_duration":189337192926,"load_duration":326310,"prompt_eval_count":405,"prompt_eval_duration":38001845000,"eval_count":382,"eval_duration":151334346000}
