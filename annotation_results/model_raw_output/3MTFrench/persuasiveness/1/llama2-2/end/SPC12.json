{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T23:41:30.499869136Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness in crafting a convincing message. The speaker presents their analysis of a large dataset of medical documents and finds that a small percentage are missing temporal information, which they believe can be used to improve medical precision medicine. They propose creating profiles based on pathologies and treatments, allowing them to easily identify similar cases in the future.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is rigorous and well-supported by their analysis of the data. They provide specific numbers and percentages to back up their claims, which adds credibility to their argument. Additionally, they offer a clear solution to the problem of missing temporal information, which makes their proposal compelling.\n\nHowever, there is one area where the speaker could improve: clarity in presentation. At times, the speaker's delivery can be somewhat dry and factual, which may make it difficult for some listeners to fully grasp the significance of their findings. To address this, the speaker could consider using more engaging language and visual aids to help illustrate their points.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a well-reasoned and persuasive argument for how medical precision medicine can be improved through the use of temporal information. With some adjustments in presentation style, they could even further enhance the impact of their message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,782,977,273,297,1131,295,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,4727,1249,19601,2257,16933,3058,882,9577,1411,818,659,631,29889,8748,1465,1601,714,309,29892,432,29915,1794,4021,29792,29871,4277,316,289,2035,371,25406,2131,29889,435,29915,1794,5246,1597,16455,344,316,7015,5614,631,784,4237,1190,29871,29953,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1426,267,29892,634,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,712,29871,29896,29995,316,7015,10701,16474,2406,427,289,2035,371,25406,2131,29889,8292,262,1318,818,4883,27965,1314,29871,29896,29900,14746,316,10701,29892,29871,4277,5246,16573,316,29871,29896,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1426,267,1750,3435,3104,296,18029,1098,5326,610,2257,289,2035,29889,3872,29883,274,29915,342,12866,443,4768,1803,4655,818,23532,427,16731,7628,316,425,17789,4080,316,26814,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,10016,10098,712,1444,724,1794,15390,316,9073,29871,4277,29892,1444,1671,23469,1437,4951,381,553,20077,4072,610,2224,11763,634,818,2257,712,274,29915,342,818,553,1020,667,1237,29889,422,1004,29871,4277,29892,18097,443,13164,15935,29876,564,3511,29874,29892,1444,1671,23469,2258,455,944,7769,261,427,3911,977,424,966,1020,667,1237,1750,724,609,1027,4233,533,5695,29889,3872,29883,18097,6896,398,29948,23068,818,325,359,21880,29892,1209,29948,634,22847,29892,8556,29231,453,787,1671,454,3105,332,29892,425,1873,29871,29906,29889,29900,316,425,25974,457,316,16784,2459,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,7418,310,263,2919,8783,310,16083,10701,322,14061,393,263,2319,19649,526,4567,25406,2472,29892,607,896,4658,508,367,1304,304,11157,16083,16716,26602,29889,2688,16193,4969,28723,2729,373,2224,11763,322,7539,1860,29892,14372,963,304,5948,12439,2788,4251,297,278,5434,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,491,1009,7418,310,278,848,29889,2688,3867,2702,3694,322,10151,1179,304,1250,701,1009,16726,29892,607,12778,6625,4127,304,1009,2980,29889,19814,29892,896,5957,263,2821,1650,304,278,1108,310,4567,25406,2472,29892,607,3732,1009,24963,752,7807,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,338,697,4038,988,278,25657,1033,11157,29901,7542,537,297,24329,29889,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,508,367,10579,15589,322,2114,950,29892,607,1122,1207,372,5189,363,777,11621,414,304,8072,25274,278,26002,310,1009,1284,886,29889,1763,3211,445,29892,278,25657,1033,2050,773,901,3033,6751,4086,322,7604,263,4841,304,1371,28475,1009,3291,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,23147,287,322,20408,294,573,2980,363,920,16083,16716,26602,508,367,16710,1549,278,671,310,25406,2472,29889,2973,777,10365,1860,297,24329,3114,29892,896,1033,1584,4340,26371,749,278,10879,310,1009,2643,29889],"total_duration":59215967310,"load_duration":188077,"prompt_eval_count":280,"prompt_eval_duration":23453530000,"eval_count":290,"eval_duration":35761732000}
