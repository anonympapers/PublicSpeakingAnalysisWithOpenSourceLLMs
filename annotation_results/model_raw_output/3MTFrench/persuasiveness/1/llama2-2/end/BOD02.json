{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T20:11:08.550215766Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points and arguments regarding the potential benefits of their research, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message could be more convincing.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that the speaker acknowledges the limitations of their current research and the need for further scientific investigation before any teraproject can be proposed. This shows a willingness to engage in critical thinking and a recognition of the importance of rigorous scientific methods. However, the speaker could have gone into more detail about the specific challenges and obstacles they face in their research, which might have made their argument more persuasive.\n\nAnother area where the speech could be improved is the use of concrete examples and evidence to support the speaker's claims. While the speaker mentions some potential benefits of their research, such as \"recupér[ing] 10 années de vie,\" they do not provide any specific data or studies to back up these claims. This lack of empirical evidence makes it difficult to fully evaluate the speaker's arguments and assess their persuasiveness.\n\nOverall, while there are some valid points made in the speech, the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message could be more convincing with the use of more specific examples and evidence to support the claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,11948,454,25698,5000,274,29915,342,439,29915,1540,26744,3669,600,661,371,3479,289,743,7719,2947,1391,533,11387,316,14344,13181,1908,439,29915,1540,26744,2535,443,1298,4226,29889,8748,12866,29871,4277,8164,3710,30037,4630,425,1841,1713,316,11546,2741,5040,29889,19551,316,611,266,17449,29892,1444,1437,3364,1080,818,8714,316,289,743,2131,29889,2581,26099,15390,270,29915,11236,7608,443,4843,272,1513,882,1465,454,5147,345,585,29889,8748,432,29915,264,9080,1597,639,371,316,1298,9577,25595,29889,11948,274,29915,342,454,364,30037,345,8474,454,289,743,2131,29889,838,943,29892,18097,1903,1249,966,3038,267,289,2638,5908,1671,5646,454,9122,29889,8748,6079,1661,29892,2257,452,2331,1354,2560,29889,1704,966,22069,2535,966,339,1379,1444,6427,8284,7209,7890,7848,544,11992,29889,2726,269,473,275,29889,438,1481,29892,274,29915,342,443,15744,1518,4894,663,6042,744,29889,1720,2258,566,336,10440,21394,270,29915,4548,4894,663,9638,22781,29889,6803,7848,269,30095,29878,868,17889,316,14344,13181,1908,1465,454,5147,345,585,29892,10042,452,9551,261,1597,1935,2390,347,14255,365,650,29889,838,943,29892,7890,1750,29871,22730,17222,634,17385,29948,29892,19136,4895,29920,29899,29876,681,1465,425,23520,1671,1841,5231,29539,7015,29871,29896,29900,8595,316,6316,21285,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,322,6273,11211,278,7037,23633,310,1009,5925,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2643,1033,367,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,24084,2710,278,27028,310,1009,1857,5925,322,278,817,363,4340,16021,22522,1434,738,1935,481,307,622,508,367,7972,29889,910,3697,263,17762,2264,304,3033,482,297,12187,7291,322,263,19679,310,278,13500,310,12912,20657,16021,3519,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,1033,505,7695,964,901,9493,1048,278,2702,18066,267,322,14979,23435,896,3700,297,1009,5925,29892,607,1795,505,1754,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,2744,1228,4038,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,338,278,671,310,18387,6455,322,10757,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,5806,278,25657,26649,777,7037,23633,310,1009,5925,29892,1316,408,376,3757,786,1064,29961,292,29962,29871,29896,29900,8595,316,6316,1699,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,848,470,11898,304,1250,701,1438,16726,29889,910,10225,310,29190,936,10757,3732,372,5189,304,8072,14707,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,322,24809,1009,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,2854,3291,1754,297,278,12032,29892,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2643,1033,367,901,17953,3277,411,278,671,310,901,2702,6455,322,10757,304,2304,278,16726,29889],"total_duration":58466086078,"load_duration":184965,"prompt_eval_count":259,"prompt_eval_duration":21688166000,"eval_count":301,"eval_duration":36777237000}
