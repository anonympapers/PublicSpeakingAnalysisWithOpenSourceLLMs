The speaker presents some interesting data and observations about the relationship between beard size and parenting abilities in mice, but there are some limitations to their argument that detract from its overall persuasiveness.\n\nFirstly, the sample size of the study is quite small, with only a limited number of mice included in the analysis. This makes it difficult to generalize the findings to larger populations of mice or even to other species. A larger and more diverse sample size would be needed to provide more robust evidence for the speaker's claims.\n\nSecondly, the study focuses solely on beard size as a predictor of parenting abilities, without considering other potential factors that may influence an animal's ability to care for its offspring. For example, the speaker could have explored the role of other physical characteristics, such as body size or agility, in determining an animal's parenting abilities.\n\nFinally, while the study does provide some interesting insights into the relationship between beard size and parenting abilities in mice, it is not clear how these findings might apply to other contexts or species. The speaker could have provided more context or comparisons to help illustrate the relevance of their findings to a broader audience.\n\nOverall, while the study presents some intriguing data, its limitations detract from its persuasiveness and suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between beard size and parenting abilities in animals.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,7916,2491,634,6267,11101,2131,818,316,15470,316,289,787,11825,29889,838,943,29892,3440,427,5246,373,1671,4048,6390,1354,443,17478,29899,1217,29899,29891,26652,375,29892,21181,452,2298,2560,29892,966,4439,29899,2589,273,2993,5814,1237,5291,452,2594,5707,29892,634,4191,14255,966,3165,2708,29892,966,2594,8262,3435,16133,1064,743,4191,966,2298,7916,275,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,592,375,332,29948,425,24286,332,316,7015,2594,5707,634,432,29915,1794,4880,29948,1750,553,17478,29899,1217,29899,311,29899,29876,681,316,11107,7905,966,2298,13830,29889,6803,904,791,2853,966,10882,20816,3847,2122,316,286,2249,28230,2993,29892,432,29915,1794,18741,29948,454,5419,316,5697,1169,1750,454,1391,275,1249,13933,1597,19951,8288,712,425,260,8284,634,454,772,4841,316,7015,282,21167,1144,29889,8748,782,2186,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,29871,4277,263,27282,29973,435,29915,1794,5820,29948,712,966,17478,29899,1217,29899,311,1314,1750,23997,553,2594,5707,2298,5697,3246,634,1750,302,29915,23071,12866,966,17478,29899,1217,29899,311,1314,1750,302,29915,23071,2331,337,24359,316,1750,263,4880,1465,454,289,562,13933,6267,8182,9948,23997,553,2594,5707,2298,5697,3246,29892,12866,1750,15777,11387,7916,3783,316,6267,752,1908,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,634,274,29915,342,18916,29892,263,6896,499,271,9577,26842,404,424,29892,4439,20792,454,5246,439,29915,2719,634,11387,316,521,2925,316,1326,29877,7808,443,17103,316,1302,5411,14255,1597,4445,1808,28194,2257,13704,29899,455,409,1391,275,29892,11797,325,609,1391,533,553,282,21167,1144,2298,26379,634,427,2298,4595,5419,712,6267,752,5793,29889,23719,1039,29973,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,848,322,13917,1048,278,9443,1546,367,538,2159,322,3847,292,633,9770,297,286,625,29892,541,727,526,777,27028,304,1009,2980,393,1439,1461,515,967,12463,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,4559,2159,310,278,6559,338,3755,2319,29892,411,871,263,9078,1353,310,286,625,5134,297,278,7418,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,2498,675,278,1284,886,304,7200,23093,310,286,625,470,1584,304,916,6606,29889,319,7200,322,901,16984,4559,2159,723,367,4312,304,3867,901,16424,10757,363,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,6559,8569,267,14419,368,373,367,538,2159,408,263,8500,272,310,3847,292,633,9770,29892,1728,13858,916,7037,13879,393,1122,9949,385,13019,29915,29879,11509,304,2562,363,967,1283,4278,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,3902,4395,278,6297,310,916,9128,21862,29892,1316,408,3573,2159,470,946,1793,29892,297,3683,2827,385,13019,29915,29879,3847,292,633,9770,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,1550,278,6559,947,3867,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,9443,1546,367,538,2159,322,3847,292,633,9770,297,286,625,29892,372,338,451,2821,920,1438,1284,886,1795,3394,304,916,3030,29879,470,6606,29889,450,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,470,5734,14125,304,1371,28475,278,29527,749,310,1009,1284,886,304,263,2545,1664,20026,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,6559,22981,777,11158,5526,292,848,29892,967,27028,1439,1461,515,967,20408,294,20193,322,4368,393,4340,5925,338,4312,304,8072,2274,278,9443,1546,367,538,2159,322,3847,292,633,9770,297,15006,29889],"total_duration":70574735668,"load_duration":264510,"prompt_eval_count":328,"prompt_eval_duration":27544629000,"eval_count":347,"eval_duration":43029292000}
