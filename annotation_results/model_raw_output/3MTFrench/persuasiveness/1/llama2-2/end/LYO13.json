{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T15:46:20.390837454Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by introducing the concept of \"mat√©riaux\" and how it relates to the strength of individuals in a network. They provide examples to illustrate their point, such as the effect of temperature and age on an individual's strength. However, they do not provide sufficient evidence or data to support their claims, which could be more persuasive.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument relies heavily on analogies and metaphors, such as comparing the development of a polymer to the aging process of individuals in the network. While these analogies can be useful for illustrating a point, they do not necessarily provide a rigorous mathematical or scientific basis for the argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make the argument more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1775,4894,2993,712,301,29915,265,17043,13871,818,4048,6390,425,26722,4555,1444,1162,1297,427,18165,316,425,4889,712,432,29915,735,261,346,29889,997,4889,270,29915,348,4348,29884,868,28710,302,29915,342,2331,2560,29889,6340,452,2947,17631,9030,316,20081,1828,14228,29889,1459,17488,29892,425,5694,19113,316,425,2930,10491,3503,8648,1487,19406,479,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,1465,1601,878,15340,29892,966,4348,29884,4625,443,19406,479,4191,316,425,325,336,347,6316,29889,8748,980,20423,6316,453,381,29889,1174,1109,1173,29892,1465,1601,878,15340,29892,2298,443,4348,29884,707,19406,29887,29948,29892,2298,980,707,5162,29889,1551,8164,7199,9030,29871,4277,316,26722,25235,2560,29889,9353,425,29188,6722,2298,443,4348,29884,707,19406,29887,29948,29892,2298,980,263,2002,1209,29948,316,8714,1465,5278,2602,29892,966,289,2390,453,743,29892,263,6896,391,29948,818,1597,4889,1750,269,29915,735,261,346,1190,3911,29889,1720,263,2002,12866,330,4211,29948,427,2301,1810,1535,818,4889,316,301,29915,296,336,30058,17239,29889,315,29915,342,443,17887,7006,454,6701,29095,712,28194,7890,634,19601,29892,818,301,29915,14531,29892,818,425,269,3498,316,7980,29889,315,29915,342,1671,316,15470,2298,5162,29889,997,1302,802,316,1601,357,966,6299,29879,2011,1849,263,2002,12866,10331,749,818,316,15470,316,2298,427,2298,12912,680,29892,818,29188,712,454,8714,21714,29892,7847,802,966,4348,29884,1750,425,10719,296,3435,2298,427,2298,5162,29889,2581,325,1759,7890,1029,381,29892,6701,1354,29892,712,19601,5695,29892,29202,29892,1444,592,544,1975,818,364,30037,369,270,29915,5474,443,24324,261,29889,1459,346,712,425,18520,316,316,15470,2298,5162,427,10636,19505,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,4547,3277,278,6964,310,376,2922,4894,2993,29908,322,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,9324,310,15724,297,263,3564,29889,2688,3867,6455,304,28475,1009,1298,29892,1316,408,278,2779,310,10430,322,5046,373,385,5375,29915,29879,9324,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,8002,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,15690,583,322,1539,12451,943,29892,1316,408,17420,278,5849,310,263,24324,261,304,278,946,292,1889,310,15724,297,278,3564,29889,5806,1438,15690,583,508,367,5407,363,8632,1218,263,1298,29892,896,437,451,12695,3867,263,12912,20657,19475,470,16021,8405,363,278,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,278,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":105195535142,"load_duration":378499,"prompt_eval_count":339,"prompt_eval_duration":30366492000,"eval_count":245,"eval_duration":74828042000}
