{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T13:41:59.733403032Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using simple language and avoiding technical jargon. They also use rhetorical questions to engage the audience and emphasize their points. However, the speech lacks a clear call to action or a compelling conclusion that would leave a lasting impression on the audience. A higher score in this dimension could be achieved by providing more specific examples or testimonials to support the speaker's claims.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker's argument is based on some logical assumptions, such as the idea that the virus can spread through direct contact. However, there are some inconsistencies in the reasoning that could be improved upon. For instance, the speaker mentions that the virus can transmit through \"contacts directes,\" but they don't provide any clarification or evidence to support this claim. A higher score in this dimension could be achieved by providing more detailed explanations and evidence to support the speaker's arguments.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some persuasive elements, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and a clearer call to action to make it more convincing to the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,17043,13639,1487,17889,29892,1444,286,3610,927,966,304,29916,1475,316,872,9523,1445,782,1302,802,2535,454,24424,316,301,29915,1466,282,2093,29892,782,10402,29892,1444,10420,1759,712,5278,304,29916,457,7853,7608,1249,425,21666,868,24424,29892,3503,10814,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,1354,2560,29889,2581,286,29915,6698,1794,364,1975,16731,712,1436,6311,29892,3058,267,1671,7848,782,6761,533,818,5273,424,381,872,410,11476,29889,951,3623,479,316,425,10466,2215,661,311,29899,29879,29915,328,404,3958,29892,752,5897,2123,297,283,30019,424,29889,405,29915,264,339,9061,409,1671,29658,1465,1601,10212,20141,29892,980,7890,2258,566,336,1098,9030,425,1436,316,611,260,5340,1671,17043,13639,425,10541,29889,478,681,301,29915,1351,29920,7199,275,29892,454,24424,316,301,29915,1466,282,2093,707,2654,449,519,29892,7628,339,29915,309,26946,524,1465,425,589,2922,347,634,11062,260,30069,29886,1387,29889,1174,8182,533,966,12997,3783,29892,2257,29627,29892,782,11387,29892,443,13164,29758,262,29892,427,904,18505,29889,8748,980,452,21668,2331,2123,29890,4926,439,29915,309,8164,409,18750,1803,276,610,6958,267,1513,267,29889,8153,336,7890,270,29915,326,351,4983,7594,1134,316,6958,6079,875,355,29884,29889,838,943,29892,16134,424,712,7890,17043,5582,29920,301,29915,735,331,552,332,282,19971,29892,4439,20792,454,544,8885,29886,1750,6309,439,29915,309,2947,6628,1314,9073,425,5758,712,425,12573,29892,1354,1444,1236,1314,7890,27516,443,27923,29892,274,29915,342,712,425,5758,274,29915,342,367,585,29889,2664,2652,681,29892,274,29915,342,6079,29892,3503,29202,29892,980,707,782,6628,1314,712,29871,4277,452,12852,712,316,658,262,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,322,4772,292,16905,432,1191,265,29889,2688,884,671,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,19310,675,1009,3291,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,263,2821,1246,304,3158,470,263,752,7807,15997,393,723,5967,263,1833,292,17188,373,278,20026,29889,319,6133,8158,297,445,9927,1033,367,14363,491,13138,901,2702,6455,470,1243,20170,616,29879,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,2729,373,777,16667,20813,29892,1316,408,278,2969,393,278,24424,508,9677,1549,1513,6958,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,22435,8244,2478,297,278,24481,393,1033,367,16710,2501,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,24424,508,22649,1549,376,12346,29879,1513,267,1699,541,896,1016,29915,29873,3867,738,7542,2450,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,319,6133,8158,297,445,9927,1033,367,14363,491,13138,901,13173,7309,800,322,10757,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,756,777,20408,294,573,3161,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,263,26135,1246,304,3158,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,304,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":144849864089,"load_duration":265586,"prompt_eval_count":341,"prompt_eval_duration":39349596000,"eval_count":292,"eval_duration":105499373000}
