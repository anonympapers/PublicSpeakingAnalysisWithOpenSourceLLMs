The speaker presents their message in a clear and concise manner, using simple language and relatable examples to make their point. They also provide specific details about their company's production process and the potential benefits of their approach.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speech could be improved. For example, the speaker could have provided more evidence or data to support their claims, such as statistics on the effectiveness of their company's waste management practices or testimonials from satisfied customers. Additionally, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or objections to their position, such as concerns about cost or feasibility.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-structured and easy to follow, it could benefit from more substance and evidence to make it more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,818,7814,330,22702,1750,1391,275,296,454,8774,880,484,29889,2598,1203,361,707,2560,29892,13547,1597,2637,7734,18848,27275,2298,1671,1391,533,2298,1671,330,18303,2298,29889,1174,22259,2131,29892,18402,5703,29948,3928,818,443,11107,316,289,627,29948,2722,29892,521,562,348,2535,1597,18165,805,4582,22781,29889,4241,841,424,29892,14034,29920,29899,23088,712,25235,270,29915,468,22702,12852,4439,1943,29892,712,2257,4940,603,29889,751,29915,1131,579,19783,267,29892,26744,452,8164,454,1083,13974,2265,29889,997,5802,707,3948,11992,1318,29889,315,29915,342,1671,18729,712,1444,27510,275,818,4883,5703,743,553,5855,316,18848,5994,744,29892,4191,443,16868,1444,11553,276,2123,1597,946,7018,7744,1318,29889,6803,1436,381,29892,1444,286,29915,328,3610,895,454,5646,29892,18934,316,7890,2970,4145,819,316,8774,941,30058,4515,8556,24684,787,1391,533,2535,301,29915,24031,316,7814,1437,305,1691,2894,3783,1671,712,7814,7446,1564,7545,1391,275,296,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,316,1261,475,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2643,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,322,1104,17219,6455,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,2688,884,3867,2702,4902,1048,1009,5001,29915,29879,5802,1889,322,278,7037,23633,310,1009,2948,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,13964,373,278,2779,20193,310,1009,5001,29915,29879,19863,10643,23274,470,1243,20170,616,29879,515,15787,20330,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,704,24247,304,1009,2602,29892,1316,408,21838,1048,3438,470,28326,4127,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,1532,29899,4984,2955,322,4780,304,1101,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,5960,749,322,10757,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":97156906644,"load_duration":253907,"prompt_eval_count":204,"prompt_eval_duration":22709916000,"eval_count":192,"eval_duration":74446098000}
