The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning, but there are also some areas where their message could be more effective.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the speaker's emphasis on the importance of the economy being competitive. They provide a clear and concise explanation of why this is the case, highlighting the benefits of having a competitive economy. This helps to build a strong foundation for their argument.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve. For example, they do not provide any specific examples or evidence to support their claims, which can make their message feel somewhat vague and unsubstantiated. Additionally, the speaker's use of \"c'est nous de passe\" and \"c'est pas c'est termin√© ok\" can come across as somewhat simplistic and lacking in nuance.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments, there are areas where they could improve to make their message more persuasive and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,3067,4599,347,9577,4100,707,25732,3321,29889,838,943,274,29915,342,8556,316,21714,1750,707,269,29915,309,707,818,301,29915,29948,4599,347,25881,707,9577,4100,634,4625,28643,443,7307,29907,29889,315,29915,342,818,8556,316,21714,818,301,29915,3496,381,707,1095,11586,347,427,18551,1841,535,5553,631,316,1437,3511,301,29915,29948,4599,347,634,634,274,29915,342,2331,274,29915,342,6624,29948,3431,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,1009,2643,1033,367,901,11828,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,25657,29915,29879,19310,275,373,278,13500,310,278,26504,1641,5100,3321,29889,2688,3867,263,2821,322,3022,895,8252,310,2020,445,338,278,1206,29892,12141,292,278,23633,310,2534,263,5100,3321,26504,29889,910,6911,304,2048,263,4549,22778,363,1009,2980,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,508,1207,1009,2643,4459,10579,25160,322,443,22492,3656,630,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,376,29883,29915,342,8556,316,21714,29908,322,376,29883,29915,342,2331,274,29915,342,6624,29948,3431,29908,508,2041,4822,408,10579,5466,4695,322,10225,292,297,4948,749,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":92630070720,"load_duration":285808,"prompt_eval_count":88,"prompt_eval_duration":12419649000,"eval_count":233,"eval_duration":80209422000}
