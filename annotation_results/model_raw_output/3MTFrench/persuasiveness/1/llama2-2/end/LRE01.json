{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T06:46:12.953403943Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \"Aujourd'hui, 80% du commerce mondial voyage par la mère\") and emotional appeals (e.g., \"des papiers qui peuvent pas rétrenper parlement mais qui me passionne\") to make their point. However, there are some instances where the speaker relies on unsubstantiated claims or oversimplifies complex issues. For example, the statement that \"les rôtes maritimes ne sont pas ses différentes que les rôtes terrestres\" is not supported by any evidence and seems to be based more on anecdotal evidence than rigorous analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument relies heavily on the idea that the mother is a symbol of stability and security, which may not be applicable to all audiences. Some people may view the mother as a restrictive figure rather than a source of comfort and security, and the speaker does not adequately address this potential critique.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear argument, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make their case more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,316,9484,261,443,878,15340,1750,14924,316,534,8885,454,925,29872,22591,2637,19548,279,276,634,1302,459,10500,1671,425,3444,634,3999,29758,1144,1465,553,21904,4191,301,29915,29948,4599,347,29892,301,29915,29948,21553,347,2123,425,7019,2764,2131,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,3911,1437,17843,276,29892,1444,3911,7468,425,2225,344,29892,1444,301,275,316,872,1034,311,282,30037,1173,29892,1444,301,275,316,872,1034,311,4303,1064,1318,29892,1444,592,26099,289,999,29892,553,282,2754,414,1750,20423,2331,1841,509,264,546,610,358,3503,1750,592,15935,484,29889,2581,766,712,304,29875,5695,2535,553,18554,1750,10135,374,16011,7015,26742,2445,583,1766,277,1355,634,1750,3435,2011,267,1465,872,992,533,439,29915,265,452,16391,2331,1465,966,29869,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,29871,29947,29900,29995,868,24346,7398,616,17775,610,425,21428,29889,2664,364,30069,2167,1766,277,1355,452,3435,2331,3999,28374,712,966,364,30069,2167,27386,690,29892,1354,2411,381,403,2535,443,330,488,29873,285,601,818,11062,330,29894,316,289,403,585,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,2970,11469,818,325,359,521,542,324,1446,316,4870,29889,8748,1671,3022,29878,545,443,633,295,29892,321,29882,6079,14875,634,4581,29899,21076,4729,29892,1444,452,7890,652,23469,439,29915,1540,12784,29889,405,29915,283,2204,26477,2331,439,29915,585,18997,29915,15669,29892,2298,1750,343,707,29892,1750,260,993,818,425,21428,29892,260,993,454,9122,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,29909,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,29871,29947,29900,29995,868,24346,7398,616,17775,610,425,21428,1159,322,23023,1848,5929,1338,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,2783,282,2754,414,1750,20423,2331,1841,509,264,546,610,944,3503,1750,592,15935,484,1159,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,8871,988,278,25657,337,3687,373,443,22492,3656,630,16726,470,288,874,13699,11057,4280,5626,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,3229,393,376,793,364,30069,2167,1766,277,1355,452,3435,2331,3999,28374,712,966,364,30069,2167,27386,690,29908,338,451,6969,491,738,10757,322,2444,304,367,2729,901,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,1135,12912,20657,7418,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,278,2969,393,278,5637,338,263,5829,310,25806,322,6993,29892,607,1122,451,367,22903,304,599,12990,819,778,29889,3834,2305,1122,1776,278,5637,408,263,9250,573,4377,3265,1135,263,2752,310,13016,322,6993,29892,322,278,25657,947,451,19967,339,2486,3211,445,7037,29709,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,1009,1206,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":141956840538,"load_duration":251431,"prompt_eval_count":294,"prompt_eval_duration":32010272000,"eval_count":314,"eval_duration":109945707000}
