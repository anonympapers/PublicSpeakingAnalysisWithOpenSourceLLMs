{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T06:48:12.178147332Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents their idea to transform the campus into an agricultural farm, but also acknowledges the challenges and limitations of the proposal. They express a willingness to listen to the opinions of the actors involved in the project and the population, which suggests a genuine effort to be inclusive and considerate of different perspectives.\n\nHowever, the speech could be more persuasive by providing more detailed reasoning and evidence to support the proposal. The speaker mentions the need for information on the population, economy, and environment, but does not provide any specific examples or data to demonstrate how this information would be used to inform the amendment process. Additionally, the speech could benefit from a clearer articulation of the benefits and advantages of the proposed transformation, as well as any potential risks or challenges that may arise.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates a willingness to listen and engage with the population, more detailed reasoning and evidence are needed to fully persuade the audience of the merits of the proposal.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,454,24165,2123,7814,10984,2993,29892,634,270,29915,264,9073,1597,285,10877,9221,23249,29892,3503,1559,373,8556,2906,1249,6003,381,818,301,29915,29948,1195,7598,553,2852,4749,1934,610,8474,29889,7747,712,19601,1444,1236,1314,9073,29892,274,29915,342,1437,18821,29948,712,553,301,29915,9961,6609,270,29915,314,1690,5049,1750,2947,2535,1487,22922,29889,6803,18729,29892,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,270,29915,262,689,800,1190,425,4665,29892,1190,301,29915,29948,4599,347,29892,301,29915,21813,17239,29892,782,9587,316,425,9257,634,6079,270,29915,18288,29889,2598,18848,29892,274,29915,342,316,12584,5495,2535,1601,22420,7289,1671,427,429,5435,553,14517,316,21880,634,553,10701,316,521,1117,351,2786,29892,966,19313,4555,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,29889,11948,432,29915,1794,5695,3008,28230,553,1044,11620,316,301,29915,314,1690,5049,1750,3435,966,14931,1295,316,15744,634,7890,29892,425,4665,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,1112,700,818,443,1139,15421,634,592,1040,1008,29202,9291,29915,30001,1597,540,545,316,26814,8714,427,2637,29899,19521,262,1671,592,337,1050,1358,553,20854,2234,782,13295,1444,301,29915,264,7468,18413,10420,29948,29889,28079,267,7015,19313,592,19172,296,270,29915,348,21384,316,10714,261,553,20077,29879,316,22922,29892,316,301,29915,18288,29892,316,1437,18821,261,29892,316,425,3367,4427,2131,553,410,27499,270,29915,314,1690,5049,634,316,325,1064,3709,6267,19967,339,362,29889,838,943,29892,2778,455,818,7890,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,304,4327,278,24165,964,385,18032,3631,17888,29892,541,884,24084,2710,278,18066,267,322,27028,310,278,24963,29889,2688,4653,263,17762,2264,304,11621,304,278,26971,310,278,29701,9701,297,278,2060,322,278,4665,29892,607,14661,263,29120,457,7225,304,367,20978,573,322,2050,403,310,1422,3736,1103,3145,29889,13,13,17245,29892,278,12032,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,491,13138,901,13173,24481,322,10757,304,2304,278,24963,29889,450,25657,26649,278,817,363,2472,373,278,4665,29892,26504,29892,322,5177,29892,541,947,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,22222,920,445,2472,723,367,1304,304,1871,278,626,355,358,1889,29889,19814,29892,278,12032,1033,14169,515,263,26135,1616,293,2785,310,278,23633,322,25486,310,278,7972,13852,29892,408,1532,408,738,7037,5161,2039,470,18066,267,393,1122,29030,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,9004,1078,263,17762,2264,304,11621,322,3033,482,411,278,4665,29892,901,13173,24481,322,10757,526,4312,304,8072,20408,1943,278,20026,310,278,2778,1169,310,278,24963,29889],"total_duration":119207686522,"load_duration":288564,"prompt_eval_count":293,"prompt_eval_duration":31655872000,"eval_count":243,"eval_duration":87550913000}
