{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T01:20:02.512712037Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"On l'a bouddoir à moi et bien, c'est vous\") and hyperbole (\"Je viens d'y scooter avec vous pour comprendre ce qui vous fait sentir, ici plus c'kayeur, libre de vous relâcher\") to create a sense of intimacy and connection with the audience. The use of the first person pronoun \"je\" also adds a personal touch and makes the speaker more relatable.\n\nHowever, the speaker's reasoning is not always rigorous, as they make some generalizations without providing sufficient evidence or logical arguments. For example, the statement that \"des éléments de rupture avec l'environnement urbain, telle que la févédation, la présence d'une pente ou la différence de niveau, vous aidera vous relâchera un ville\" is not supported by any concrete examples or studies.\n\nOverall, while the speaker uses some effective rhetorical devices and creates a sense of intimacy with the audience, their reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make their argument more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,1661,29892,7890,302,29915,22730,2331,2025,6311,13220,29889,365,29915,267,3535,5246,29202,316,7890,2257,439,29915,309,2453,329,29889,1174,7890,5820,424,29892,7890,286,29915,1351,29920,623,3780,1373,28805,270,29915,348,29892,10741,521,15806,1190,7015,1095,307,1169,13180,1601,22085,9061,29889,478,681,286,29915,1351,29920,623,3780,610,17488,712,553,7877,29948,1860,316,5796,415,545,2535,301,29915,21813,17239,23499,475,29892,260,1808,712,425,285,5903,2487,362,29892,425,29845,270,29915,1540,282,2016,2123,425,12694,663,316,19666,29892,7890,263,1241,29874,7890,1104,30057,305,1572,443,8441,29889,435,29915,1794,7199,275,712,301,29915,14531,7890,27516,1597,4771,362,553,658,647,4110,5695,6079,5829,3783,712,1998,2491,29892,1750,7890,263,1241,29874,7890,4303,29539,29889,11948,432,29915,1794,5695,4370,5227,407,29948,610,966,14231,285,2905,1169,610,23563,270,29915,14056,7890,1671,7175,862,261,6267,14913,270,29915,7342,427,12246,29920,424,10042,270,29915,12572,818,301,29915,485,11710,482,29889,1174,5646,3209,29892,4883,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,18097,7890,29871,22730,1190,7015,5152,3302,29899,27048,29892,269,1829,29920,712,1444,7890,14111,29889,1551,301,29915,29874,9820,20141,818,19601,634,6079,29892,274,29915,342,7890,29889,2581,14387,1082,454,2730,19844,316,7890,25924,29889,2581,7890,330,9061,29889,8748,29202,29892,1444,3516,575,270,29915,29891,885,3155,261,2535,7890,1671,7199,9030,2257,1750,7890,5246,2665,381,29892,29871,1654,2298,274,29915,29895,388,5411,29892,13220,316,7890,1104,30057,4630,29892,634,316,27962,427,13545,6233,2123,13545,3948,11992,743,316,325,359,3438,9351,316,18848,10042,611,1924,1314,316,10814,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,4852,2951,301,29915,29874,16380,1289,6390,818,19601,634,6079,29892,274,29915,342,7890,1159,322,11266,833,280,4852,13836,3516,575,270,29915,29891,885,3155,261,2535,7890,1671,7199,9030,2257,1750,7890,5246,2665,381,29892,29871,1654,2298,274,29915,29895,388,5411,29892,13220,316,7890,1104,30057,4630,1159,304,1653,263,4060,310,938,326,4135,322,3957,411,278,20026,29889,450,671,310,278,937,2022,11504,1309,376,1324,29908,884,12778,263,7333,6023,322,3732,278,25657,901,1104,17219,29889,13,13,17245,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,408,896,1207,777,2498,17063,1728,13138,8002,10757,470,16667,6273,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,3229,393,376,2783,7877,29948,1860,316,5796,415,545,2535,301,29915,21813,17239,23499,475,29892,260,1808,712,425,285,5903,2487,362,29892,425,29845,270,29915,1540,282,2016,2123,425,12694,663,316,19666,29892,7890,263,1241,29874,7890,1104,30057,305,1572,443,8441,29908,338,451,6969,491,738,18387,6455,470,11898,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3913,777,11828,364,9188,272,936,9224,322,10017,263,4060,310,938,326,4135,411,278,20026,29892,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":141679441006,"load_duration":247349,"prompt_eval_count":332,"prompt_eval_duration":36586187000,"eval_count":286,"eval_duration":105091957000}
