{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T10:15:53.063088922Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents their idea in a clear and concise manner, using technical terms and medical imagery to explain their concept. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker mentions that they have found a way to remodel a person's face without any constraints, but they do not provide any specific details or examples to support this claim. This lack of evidence makes it difficult to fully understand their approach and how it differs from existing methods.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker discusses the importance of compatibility and resistance to wear and tear in their technique, they do not provide any data or studies to support these claims. This lack of empirical evidence makes it challenging to assess the effectiveness of their approach.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a creative and innovative idea, there are some areas where they could improve the persuasiveness of their speech by providing more detailed explanations and empirical evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1083,397,1358,443,4356,276,274,29915,342,9301,316,592,2970,29920,7890,2257,302,29915,342,2331,316,301,29915,1191,488,29889,3219,1650,1136,2488,818,3667,7608,301,29915,6727,1875,347,10283,936,29889,2581,282,1947,29920,29899,280,29899,1958,4664,1190,26814,14008,1437,689,29948,1671,2654,9977,4983,521,562,1540,553,28001,18165,29876,4999,316,26814,14008,29889,2581,24853,427,21907,29835,818,425,282,10870,818,286,30069,311,301,29915,1690,4193,1387,29889,438,1481,29892,4191,1601,29871,19898,29889,1174,878,6832,424,3503,610,443,611,13639,10505,290,1893,14090,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,375,1039,818,534,8885,427,1436,5340,966,1437,29887,2925,553,2085,29890,1973,805,4582,361,3783,316,26814,1444,348,5340,29889,11948,2257,302,29915,342,2331,5646,29889,461,7697,276,1841,295,611,17039,545,954,20600,1577,365,29915,326,2590,29871,29941,553,11510,2122,707,454,3669,600,280,1750,18332,14913,818,1601,29871,19898,29889,1459,15570,787,425,4022,533,634,5246,27962,425,1775,5289,316,301,29915,28323,316,282,2736,276,29892,818,1597,3829,4280,29872,29871,29941,29928,29889,315,3222,29892,2331,3581,1173,29889,435,29915,1794,5291,6309,18158,966,26278,9013,3246,610,872,15570,265,425,4022,533,1190,425,1775,5289,1465,1487,564,1173,260,29915,29948,802,29899,9161,29892,4191,425,410,2167,344,270,29915,1300,271,13374,424,1318,29892,432,29915,264,7468,966,8648,29892,29871,4277,263,6079,10007,13017,2131,634,29871,4277,6896,21558,818,301,29915,375,545,29889,26383,425,24407,6094,616,29892,432,29915,1794,3984,782,1298,425,11043,270,29915,5215,749,316,2257,712,5291,16623,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,16905,4958,322,16083,6382,708,304,5649,1009,6964,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,505,1476,263,982,304,1083,27224,263,2022,29915,29879,3700,1728,738,11938,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,4902,470,6455,304,2304,445,5995,29889,910,10225,310,10757,3732,372,5189,304,8072,2274,1009,2948,322,920,372,2923,414,515,5923,3519,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,5353,267,278,13500,310,24521,322,17711,304,19531,322,734,279,297,1009,11043,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,848,470,11898,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,910,10225,310,29190,936,10757,3732,372,18066,292,304,24809,278,2779,20193,310,1009,2948,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,907,1230,322,24233,1230,2969,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,12032,491,13138,901,13173,7309,800,322,29190,936,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":56224754904,"load_duration":292068,"prompt_eval_count":321,"prompt_eval_duration":27254864000,"eval_count":239,"eval_duration":28969071000}
