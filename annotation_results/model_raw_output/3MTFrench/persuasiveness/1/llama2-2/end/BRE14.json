{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T00:56:14.127257407Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively crafts a message that highlights the modernity and coloniality of the world, but could have been more rigorous in their reasoning.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of presenting a clear argument and using examples to illustrate their points. They also use rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"Il me regarde, je le regarde, je le regarde\") to emphasize their message. However, the speaker could have been more thorough in their analysis, particularly when it comes to the historical context of the issues they are discussing.\n\nFor example, while the speaker mentions the report from 2012 that highlights the systematic violence, repression, and discrimination faced by indigenous peoples, they could have provided more context on how these issues have evolved over time and how they continue to affect indigenous communities today. Additionally, the speaker could have explored more deeply the ways in which colonialism has shaped the political and social structures of the world, and how these structures perpetuate inequality and discrimination.\n\nOverall, while the speaker takes a clear stance on the issue and presents a compelling argument, they could have been more rigorous in their reasoning and provided more depth to their analysis.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,1539,2484,427,19703,5289,425,5400,2131,29892,425,25539,2131,316,24145,9122,1465,454,541,316,1841,1579,17192,381,1190,966,1136,21871,2063,2832,3783,634,2893,277,7147,29892,3033,355,5606,610,966,2313,2470,3964,397,824,267,9291,29915,30001,7814,16283,29889,951,13659,316,301,29915,265,434,2779,29884,424,29871,29906,29900,29896,29906,12468,1808,712,8556,302,29915,264,1029,787,2331,1436,29875,2535,425,21448,13107,2249,15819,29892,425,1841,558,29948,29882,2673,634,425,2313,5632,3381,10487,1318,8474,966,1236,552,262,5056,29889,951,541,316,611,266,17449,707,1436,6311,316,14954,4630,13545,25179,787,267,1465,454,1209,29948,1671,6628,1314,7199,9030,425,6434,1044,13498,316,11643,28812,1750,15481,371,5646,454,9122,29889,323,283,14186,4239,6476,7799,7907,1671,9073,3390,261,10713,4441,1169,3700,3479,15306,4110,634,3479,1773,262,1288,267,29889,1720,592,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29889,1720,6309,29892,9360,2123,1759,29892,26842,404,424,29892,443,4239,29899,29894,1908,29892,289,999,29892,432,29915,1794,3686,388,29948,270,29915,4548,492,7808,611,17949,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,25554,29879,263,2643,393,12141,29879,278,5400,537,322,25539,537,310,278,3186,29892,541,1033,505,1063,901,12912,20657,297,1009,24481,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,263,2821,2980,322,773,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29889,2688,884,671,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,4852,14126,592,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,1159,304,19310,675,1009,2643,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1063,901,17826,297,1009,7418,29892,10734,746,372,5304,304,278,15839,3030,310,278,5626,896,526,5353,292,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,278,3461,515,29871,29906,29900,29896,29906,393,12141,29879,278,1788,2454,21448,29892,2062,1211,29892,322,2313,5632,3381,20050,491,1399,2101,681,1236,459,793,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,3030,373,920,1438,5626,505,15220,1490,975,931,322,920,896,6773,304,6602,1399,2101,681,23507,9826,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,3902,4395,901,24344,278,5837,297,607,25539,1608,756,528,10501,278,8604,322,5264,12286,310,278,3186,29892,322,920,1438,12286,25722,27240,14585,322,2313,5632,3381,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,4893,263,2821,380,749,373,278,2228,322,22981,263,752,7807,2980,29892,896,1033,505,1063,901,12912,20657,297,1009,24481,322,4944,901,10809,304,1009,7418,29889],"total_duration":128462460856,"load_duration":281582,"prompt_eval_count":231,"prompt_eval_duration":25083353000,"eval_count":296,"eval_duration":103377802000}
