The speaker does not effectively craft a convincing message and their reasoning is not rigorous. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of clear argument: The speaker does not present a clear and concise argument to support their claim that \"les questions l'amens' ont manqu√©.\" They simply state that they have \"un jeu pour tout\" without providing any evidence or reasoning to back up their claim.\n2. Unclear logic: The speaker's reasoning is not rigorous, as they do not explain how their game can solve the problem of \"les questions l'amens.'\" They simply assert that their game can do so without providing any logical connections between the game and the problem.\n3. Lack of evidence: The speaker does not provide any evidence to support their claim that their game can solve the problem of \"les questions l'amens.\" Without any supporting evidence, it is difficult to take their claim seriously.\n\nOverall, the speaker's message is not persuasive and lacks rigorous reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,10050,29991,5952,443,18308,1671,5646,1671,805,2548,390,1148,336,861,521,465,275,27822,9073,553,1274,4543,29879,23968,1671,339,7768,966,5155,301,29915,314,575,29915,4625,767,17851,29892,432,29915,1794,5246,29871,239,154,135,239,181,176,14255,634,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,451,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,1009,24481,338,451,12912,20657,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,2980,29901,450,25657,947,451,2198,263,2821,322,3022,895,2980,304,2304,1009,5995,393,376,793,5155,301,29915,314,575,29915,4625,767,17851,1213,2688,3763,2106,393,896,505,376,348,18308,1671,5646,29908,1728,13138,738,10757,470,24481,304,1250,701,1009,5995,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,5900,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,12912,20657,29892,408,896,437,451,5649,920,1009,3748,508,4505,278,1108,310,376,793,5155,301,29915,314,575,6169,29908,2688,3763,4974,393,1009,3748,508,437,577,1728,13138,738,16667,12368,1546,278,3748,322,278,1108,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,1009,3748,508,4505,278,1108,310,376,793,5155,301,29915,314,575,1213,13932,738,20382,10757,29892,372,338,5189,304,2125,1009,5995,25798,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,20408,294,573,322,425,4684,12912,20657,24481,29889],"total_duration":38351803525,"load_duration":286625,"prompt_eval_count":57,"prompt_eval_duration":6009544000,"eval_count":243,"eval_duration":32341366000}
