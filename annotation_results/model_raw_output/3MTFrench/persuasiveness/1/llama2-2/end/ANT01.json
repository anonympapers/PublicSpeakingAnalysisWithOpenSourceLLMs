{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T06:37:40.68531953Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness in crafting a convincing message. The speaker provides some valid points about the importance of overcoming limiting beliefs and the negative impact they can have on one's life, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more specific examples or case studies to illustrate how these limiting beliefs can hold people back in their personal and professional lives. This would have made the argument more convincing and relatable for the audience.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker acknowledges that changing one's angle of vision and perspective is important, they could have provided more concrete advice on how to do so. This could include strategies such as practicing mindfulness, reframing negative thoughts, or seeking support from others.\n\nFinally, the speaker's call to action towards the end of the speech could have been more specific and actionable. Instead of simply urging the audience to \"make the good choice\" and \"change their angle of vision,\" they could have provided more concrete steps that the audience can take to start making progress towards overcoming their limiting beliefs.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speaker's argument could be strengthened, the transcript does provide some valuable insights into the importance of recognizing and overcoming limiting beliefs in order to achieve success.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,980,325,993,3503,980,2123,2204,347,316,26722,1841,3784,29872,1487,1775,4894,295,2123,8532,980,325,993,634,409,16391,1597,5566,1509,1190,2058,818,425,282,10669,457,29889,8882,265,980,409,432,2353,443,301,29915,14531,634,980,623,28759,2535,454,1775,4894,295,634,966,1136,27360,16253,7147,29889,315,29915,342,1671,4486,504,2872,439,29915,585,15911,270,29915,1540,260,30057,1173,712,301,29915,265,3623,479,9301,2123,9201,2923,25123,29889,1720,8164,427,5246,269,29915,351,381,270,29915,1540,274,4727,749,4046,1647,634,373,2947,27962,818,21384,316,24145,26138,904,4068,29889,9353,611,266,17449,432,29915,3717,296,454,22591,885,2963,533,3503,2257,1134,316,1841,2467,29871,4277,10714,296,818,5646,454,9122,1465,443,875,2267,819,270,29915,331,915,585,29892,1465,443,4392,262,2123,6701,1465,454,22591,6351,9139,29889,383,5793,818,1597,260,30057,1173,712,1444,452,1539,509,895,2331,301,29915,3318,361,2947,7848,316,1437,29881,2572,271,7608,966,427,1324,1314,1671,452,2331,18475,296,381,454,3008,28230,316,410,6772,914,1487,707,603,316,577,29875,29889,1720,2947,11092,417,381,1874,261,24145,10696,316,18551,29892,1874,261,1671,4327,261,1597,5189,29948,427,28602,2131,818,1436,316,1874,261,454,8569,634,1874,261,454,4880,712,301,29915,265,14931,1190,577,29875,29889,1704,1671,9073,980,21668,9073,553,14231,1671,452,2331,9073,373,16391,15237,553,7175,726,267,29889,3872,29883,16623,787,454,10814,3060,861,13704,316,425,1841,1558,568,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,8128,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,975,11506,4046,292,17750,29879,322,278,8178,10879,896,508,505,373,697,29915,29879,2834,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,470,1206,11898,304,28475,920,1438,4046,292,17750,29879,508,4808,2305,1250,297,1009,7333,322,10257,12080,29889,910,723,505,1754,278,2980,901,17953,3277,322,1104,17219,363,278,20026,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,24084,2710,393,6480,697,29915,29879,10696,310,18551,322,18520,338,4100,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,18387,9848,373,920,304,437,577,29889,910,1033,3160,16650,583,1316,408,4120,18499,3458,1319,2264,29892,337,1341,11500,8178,13133,29892,470,25738,2304,515,4045,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,1246,304,3158,7113,278,1095,310,278,12032,1033,505,1063,901,2702,322,3158,519,29889,8669,310,3763,5065,3460,278,20026,304,376,5675,278,1781,7348,29908,322,376,3167,1009,10696,310,18551,1699,896,1033,505,4944,901,18387,6576,393,278,20026,508,2125,304,1369,3907,6728,7113,975,11506,1009,4046,292,17750,29879,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29892,278,1301,924,947,3867,777,21114,1663,5861,964,278,13500,310,5936,5281,322,975,11506,4046,292,17750,29879,297,1797,304,6176,2551,29889],"total_duration":75207322650,"load_duration":194906,"prompt_eval_count":304,"prompt_eval_duration":31883106000,"eval_count":315,"eval_duration":43323533000}
