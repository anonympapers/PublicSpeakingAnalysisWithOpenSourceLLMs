The speaker's message is not particularly convincing or well-reasoned. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Lack of clarity and coherence: The speaker's argument is confusing and hard to follow. They jump between different ideas and concepts without connecting them logically, making it difficult for the listener to understand their point.\n2. Inconsistent tone: The speaker's tone changes abruptly throughout the speech, ranging from confident to uncertain, which undermines their credibility.\n3. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes claims about the effectiveness of certain treatments without providing any supporting evidence or scientific research to back them up. This lack of empirical evidence hampers their argument's persuasive power.\n4. Poor use of rhetoric: The speaker relies on vague promises and empty phrases like \"choisir au mieux les traitements\" and \"dresser une carte identité,\" without providing any concrete details or examples to illustrate their points.\n5. Internal inconsistencies: The speaker's argument is riddled with internal contradictions, such as their claim that they can \"recupérer les organes\" but also acknowledge that they cannot \"les cellules les une des autres.\" These inconsistencies undermine the speaker's credibility and make it difficult to take their argument seriously.\n\nOverall, while the speaker may have good intentions, their lack of clarity, evidence, and consistency makes their argument less persuasive than it could be.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,997,364,10870,25810,4191,1597,269,3498,270,29915,1131,2016,10042,316,19136,19844,966,2894,267,11482,2344,573,4191,454,7446,29885,585,634,454,1701,347,29889,838,943,16134,424,29892,1444,872,275,6722,11797,3435,29892,274,29915,342,6079,367,585,29892,3503,1444,872,275,610,346,439,29915,2719,4625,1465,454,9712,276,1671,6628,1314,301,6463,8474,29889,2581,1841,5231,1908,966,2894,267,29892,1444,544,3610,15792,7015,2894,267,29892,1444,872,275,2331,966,3038,2540,966,1597,553,10890,29892,634,432,29915,1794,5246,27962,1465,443,1354,29899,15135,30000,2484,427,20501,29889,10793,4933,29892,7051,533,966,3038,2540,634,966,5246,27962,966,1597,7907,966,10890,19398,443,1869,261,29889,315,3100,2453,329,592,19172,276,316,1841,5231,29539,23422,966,3038,2540,24241,1671,966,3483,952,267,29889,12390,3483,952,267,3435,13901,2122,29892,1559,11797,325,609,19172,276,316,17043,13639,966,3038,2540,634,10714,261,1597,20206,2893,2131,29889,12390,10256,4285,4625,4370,325,609,19172,276,316,3060,275,381,782,6628,1314,966,1020,667,1237,29892,1559,1444,29758,16794,29892,443,1020,17334,2852,6366,815,29892,1354,634,23422,1354,29892,980,707,3060,10770,427,18165,553,3038,2540,439,29915,264,269,29915,342,28280,29889,838,943,1444,286,29915,4582,1509,8164,29899,5474,270,29915,28619,2504,29948,1117,8837,29892,3503,286,29915,29874,1241,29874,4883,274,13805,29889,435,29915,9983,1908,712,2257,12852,29892,1444,7890,7468,2654,3409,29948,443,7006,270,29915,9983,29948,11115,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,10734,17953,3277,470,1532,29899,23147,287,29889,2266,526,777,9590,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,322,16165,261,663,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,16051,322,2898,304,1101,29889,2688,12500,1546,1422,7014,322,22001,1728,16791,963,1480,1711,29892,3907,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,2274,1009,1298,29889,13,29906,29889,512,3200,9696,16225,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,16225,3620,633,6685,368,10106,278,12032,29892,364,9776,515,24332,304,17999,29892,607,563,837,1475,1009,6625,4127,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,3058,7539,1860,1728,13138,738,20382,10757,470,16021,5925,304,1250,963,701,29889,910,10225,310,29190,936,10757,298,1160,414,1009,2980,29915,29879,20408,294,573,3081,29889,13,29946,29889,3929,272,671,310,364,9188,272,293,29901,450,25657,337,3687,373,25160,27584,322,4069,12216,2129,763,376,1859,275,381,782,6628,1314,966,1020,667,1237,29908,322,376,29881,1253,261,1597,20206,2893,2131,1699,1728,13138,738,18387,4902,470,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29889,13,29945,29889,512,1890,22435,8244,2478,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,364,2205,839,411,7463,27877,1080,29892,1316,408,1009,5995,393,896,508,376,3757,786,29539,966,2894,267,29908,541,884,18145,5485,393,896,2609,376,793,3038,2540,966,1597,553,10890,1213,4525,22435,8244,2478,563,837,457,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,322,1207,372,5189,304,2125,1009,2980,25798,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1122,505,1781,7609,1080,29892,1009,10225,310,7542,537,29892,10757,29892,322,5718,3819,3732,1009,2980,3109,20408,294,573,1135,372,1033,367,29889],"total_duration":79961811079,"load_duration":179016,"prompt_eval_count":299,"prompt_eval_duration":31227917000,"eval_count":357,"eval_duration":48733178000}
