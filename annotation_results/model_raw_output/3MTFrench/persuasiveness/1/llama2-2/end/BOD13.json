The speaker presents a novel solution to a pressing problem (the non-biodegradable nature of plastics) by combining two seemingly disparate materials (wood and plastic) to create a new, versatile material. However, the speaker's reasoning is not always rigorous, as evidenced by some fallacious claims and lack of supporting evidence.\n\nFor instance, the speaker states that the mixture of wood and plastic creates a \"panneau, un panneau, utilisable dans l'industrie de la construction,\" without providing any details on how this is achieved or what specific properties this new material possesses. Additionally, the speaker claims that their solution will \"palier entre autres, le problème de la non-géition des déchets,\" without discussing the feasibility of implementing such a solution on a large scale or addressing potential challenges and limitations.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's idea is innovative and shows some creativity, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based support to be more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,301,29915,370,690,8474,966,263,3663,359,7441,29892,4555,373,966,5663,6223,4655,2131,276,358,1465,966,24618,2361,29889,6561,2409,29892,454,260,812,29948,260,29915,264,9418,29899,332,29916,333,424,29892,1750,301,29915,29874,1082,8474,454,6316,453,11537,29892,373,6267,5663,6223,1465,454,13219,29892,712,8556,1136,3011,787,782,13911,333,819,29892,634,26154,1465,454,10814,1147,276,16053,479,316,6780,311,2993,29889,997,18768,28602,2131,439,29915,2719,269,29915,264,5957,593,8556,707,425,16987,782,1298,270,29915,262,22410,568,29889,1952,275,29892,715,579,1387,29892,427,286,3610,927,424,29892,316,425,1354,545,316,23734,29892,818,425,1354,545,316,715,579,1387,29892,1671,427,9073,443,7243,484,585,29892,443,7243,484,585,29892,22700,519,1465,301,29915,20041,2546,316,425,7632,29889,10793,3667,4371,553,1437,305,1691,715,579,3783,19172,336,316,5112,631,2637,10890,29892,454,25698,5000,316,425,1661,29899,29887,29948,654,553,1437,305,1691,29892,1750,707,443,27128,519,1652,29948,585,29892,432,29915,1794,6309,6079,29892,443,27128,519,1652,29948,585,29892,1671,966,9744,427,992,347,553,16797,4110,29889,1551,5246,29889,478,681,7199,10281,29892,274,29915,342,712,1444,16623,782,10212,20141,29892,16134,424,29889,435,29915,1794,9484,29948,29892,443,263,553,3805,634,443,20842,29889,2581,7890,337,1050,5295,29889,2581,7890,337,1050,5295,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,22981,263,9554,1650,304,263,24795,1108,313,1552,1661,29899,5365,356,5105,519,5469,310,715,579,1199,29897,491,29299,1023,2833,11687,17508,403,17279,313,6115,322,715,6288,29897,304,1653,263,716,29892,1224,24285,5518,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,408,3415,3615,1133,491,777,285,9864,8802,16726,322,10225,310,20382,10757,29889,13,13,2831,2777,29892,278,25657,5922,393,278,29544,310,8112,322,715,6288,10017,263,376,8357,484,585,29892,443,7243,484,585,29892,22700,519,1465,301,29915,20041,2546,316,425,7632,1699,1728,13138,738,4902,373,920,445,338,14363,470,825,2702,4426,445,716,5518,3119,15322,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,16726,393,1009,1650,674,376,7830,631,2637,10890,29892,454,25698,5000,316,425,1661,29899,29887,29948,654,553,1437,305,1691,1699,1728,5353,292,278,28326,4127,310,16049,1316,263,1650,373,263,2919,6287,470,3211,292,7037,18066,267,322,27028,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2969,338,24233,1230,322,3697,777,907,28157,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,2304,304,367,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":55644931361,"load_duration":266867,"prompt_eval_count":281,"prompt_eval_duration":23441663000,"eval_count":266,"eval_duration":32202414000}
