The speaker provides some interesting points and insights regarding the exposure of farmers to pesticides and their potential impact on their health. However, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more concrete evidence and data to support their claims. While they mention the presence of over 1000 different molecules in pesticides, they do not provide any specific examples or studies that demonstrate the potential harm these substances can cause. Additionally, the speaker's reliance on the memory of 180,000 individuals may not be the most reliable source of data, especially since the memories of individuals can be unreliable and influenced by various factors.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's argument could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between pesticide exposure, health outcomes, and other factors such as lifestyle, environment, and genetics. While the speaker acknowledges that there are many factors that can influence the development of disease, they do not provide a comprehensive analysis of these factors or how they interact with each other.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some important points about the potential risks of pesticides, their argument could be strengthened by providing more concrete evidence and a more nuanced understanding of the complex factors involved in disease development.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,553,902,29890,293,2247,29892,553,17564,293,2247,29892,553,1436,2200,2247,29892,2298,316,29871,29896,29900,29900,29900,6062,29948,21337,28374,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,3008,28230,316,17043,13639,301,29915,24031,316,425,6316,6351,23497,553,9221,12906,371,1295,1671,7199,9030,782,6628,1314,1671,707,4193,634,659,2853,782,6628,1314,966,2258,1169,316,521,562,1540,316,7015,14060,2187,1190,425,10503,29948,1240,802,3038,279,689,29872,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,2331,316,4933,564,456,415,30000,793,8714,29889,838,943,29892,3440,4048,6390,1750,707,2123,263,4370,14060,29948,818,439,7768,1577,435,29915,1794,301,29915,6727,5580,316,270,29915,24430,818,611,27963,29892,425,286,2249,14119,316,29871,29896,29947,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,4348,375,29892,17748,29231,23589,316,16573,2123,316,658,262,1465,454,9122,9221,23249,29889,315,3417,344,332,634,3479,22700,800,12997,3783,29892,1444,325,1759,260,5893,316,7199,9030,439,1379,3435,966,5302,1863,1934,2637,14060,2187,634,623,2518,6847,316,425,4439,328,347,29889,997,521,979,2131,316,611,266,17449,592,1261,3825,1249,7890,29892,1006,15470,10042,712,454,17268,452,12852,3817,29892,2123,28185,9373,10042,712,425,4439,328,347,302,29915,29874,2331,1791,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,3291,322,1663,5861,11211,278,14060,545,310,2215,13269,304,282,15931,2247,322,1009,7037,10879,373,1009,9045,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,18387,10757,322,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,896,3585,278,10122,310,975,29871,29896,29900,29900,29900,1422,13206,21337,297,282,15931,2247,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,11898,393,22222,278,7037,10311,1438,5960,2925,508,4556,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,12536,749,373,278,3370,310,29871,29896,29947,29900,29892,29900,29900,29900,15724,1122,451,367,278,1556,23279,2752,310,848,29892,7148,1951,278,2626,3842,310,15724,508,367,443,276,492,519,322,28482,491,5164,13879,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,14169,515,263,901,4948,8362,8004,310,278,4280,21702,1546,282,15931,680,14060,545,29892,9045,714,26807,29892,322,916,13879,1316,408,301,7004,1508,29892,5177,29892,322,2531,300,1199,29889,5806,278,25657,24084,2710,393,727,526,1784,13879,393,508,9949,278,5849,310,17135,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,15171,6270,7418,310,1438,13879,470,920,896,16254,411,1269,916,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,4100,3291,1048,278,7037,5161,2039,310,282,15931,2247,29892,1009,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,18387,10757,322,263,901,4948,8362,8004,310,278,4280,13879,9701,297,17135,5849,29889],"total_duration":60307741460,"load_duration":192986,"prompt_eval_count":248,"prompt_eval_duration":20751319000,"eval_count":322,"eval_duration":39555703000}
