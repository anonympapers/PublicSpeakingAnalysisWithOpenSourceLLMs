{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T05:03:43.590947058Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 (two) out of 5 (five) for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does not provide rigorous reasoning or convincing evidence to support their argument that the house is adapting to its environment. Instead, they rely on anecdotal evidence and exaggerated language to make their point.\n\nThe speaker's use of hyperbole, such as \"la maison je déville est tout d'assueuse et ne crème plus l'homme\" (the house is completely crazy and doesn't cream the man anymore), and \"la preuve que la nature est un autre pot\" (proof that nature is another pot) undermines their credibility and makes it difficult to take their argument seriously.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's claim that the house is adapting to its environment is not supported by any concrete evidence or logical reasoning. The speaker simply asserts that the house is \"en train de s'adapter\" (in the process of adapting) without providing any explanation or examples.\n\nOverall, while the speaker may have a personal experience with the house, their argument is not persuasive and lacks rigorous reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29892,1444,7890,301,29915,485,283,29872,9291,29915,1654,425,18234,1444,1437,4909,818,301,29915,1466,443,7006,270,29915,1893,336,7808,29889,11948,1354,373,409,6584,1173,1190,270,29915,14559,1559,627,5908,29892,373,24722,439,29915,1808,707,427,7945,316,269,29915,21412,29889,1720,302,29915,29891,263,4880,29948,1487,20299,882,29889,997,18234,1444,1437,4909,707,5646,270,29915,465,434,1509,634,452,2181,5000,2298,301,29915,21708,29892,6761,19211,818,4883,427,1324,553,11179,567,29889,9070,634,5695,29892,4191,26814,29758,262,316,282,2606,414,29892,18097,4875,16067,872,4662,1173,29892,425,18234,1444,1437,4909,409,16067,1671,425,4320,2142,533,29889,315,29915,342,439,29915,1808,707,10788,1318,316,521,14623,21394,2298,22916,1671,409,9073,875,9030,4439,20792,454,11757,276,358,6079,29889,6101,260,29915,294,270,29915,348,1841,20551,19505,8556,29892,409,6427,8284,425,758,15008,712,425,5469,707,443,14857,3104,29889,8748,10440,966,4883,427,1324,316,20016,434,1597,22577,8691,316,425,5469,712,6267,5663,6223,427,8441,29889,2664,286,4850,361,5908,29892,966,17564,267,634,966,715,3794,3435,5695,427,7945,316,269,29915,21412,818,2257,22591,3495,488,29889,1720,302,29915,29891,263,4880,29948,7015,432,5079,29899,29886,790,1934,29899,27048,1750,7446,1760,3533,4285,270,29915,5474,782,304,277,276,29889,8748,818,301,29915,28661,6722,301,29915,22481,3710,347,818,316,2298,427,2298,1190,966,363,29145,29892,274,29915,342,28185,9373,364,465,332,424,316,8689,712,425,5469,6896,895,7890,452,16391,29920,2331,29889,1704,2123,29875,29892,425,5469,18413,8556,302,29915,264,724,609,1539,2484,29889,1281,3911,285,10877,425,14931,29899,841,1318,29892,4875,337,1403,25404,610,1358,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,313,10184,29897,714,310,29871,29945,313,20818,29897,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,12912,20657,24481,470,17953,3277,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,393,278,3699,338,7744,292,304,967,5177,29889,8669,29892,896,19104,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,429,9921,630,4086,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,29892,1316,408,376,433,18234,1444,1437,4909,707,5646,270,29915,465,434,1509,634,452,2181,5000,2298,301,29915,21708,29908,313,1552,3699,338,6446,12220,1537,322,1838,29915,29873,907,314,278,767,15128,511,322,376,433,758,15008,712,425,5469,707,443,14857,3104,29908,313,8017,393,5469,338,1790,3104,29897,563,837,1475,1009,6625,4127,322,3732,372,5189,304,2125,1009,2980,25798,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,278,3699,338,7744,292,304,967,5177,338,451,6969,491,738,18387,10757,470,16667,24481,29889,450,25657,3763,408,643,1372,393,278,3699,338,376,264,7945,316,269,29915,21412,29908,313,262,278,1889,310,7744,292,29897,1728,13138,738,8252,470,6455,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1122,505,263,7333,7271,411,278,3699,29892,1009,2980,338,451,20408,294,573,322,425,4684,12912,20657,24481,29889],"total_duration":73023670179,"load_duration":256416,"prompt_eval_count":345,"prompt_eval_duration":36239996000,"eval_count":267,"eval_duration":36782751000}
