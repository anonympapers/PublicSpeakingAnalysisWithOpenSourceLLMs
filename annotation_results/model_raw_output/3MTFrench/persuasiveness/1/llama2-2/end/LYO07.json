The speaker does present some interesting points and observations about the relationship between smell and pleasure, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that the odeur they are testing is \"simple\" and \"no one has ever done it before\" is not fully supported by evidence. While it is true that there have been few studies on the neural basis of smell and pleasure, there is a growing body of research in this area that suggests that the brain's reward system is closely linked to olfactory processing.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's methodology for testing the odeur could be more systematic and controlled. While it is intriguing to observe the behavior of participants in a real-world setting, a more rigorous experiment would involve controlling for variables such as lighting, temperature, and noise levels to isolate the effect of the odeur on pleasure.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas about the relationship between smell and pleasure, their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported by evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,270,29915,348,288,311,332,634,1444,7890,26427,316,454,2665,381,29889,2581,26099,269,30095,29878,712,26814,8861,1841,2467,5246,316,592,2970,12852,29889,29871,30219,29874,3031,569,10814,29871,4277,29889,438,29884,8532,29892,1671,21023,29892,7209,282,2093,2257,534,1682,29892,610,346,712,1436,6311,29892,425,8861,12784,712,301,29915,265,18475,296,28194,301,29915,265,269,29915,264,707,1597,288,311,332,29892,274,29915,342,454,2174,275,381,1750,263,8556,410,2764,29889,11948,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,1444,26099,782,6299,19601,13933,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,2560,712,1444,286,29915,264,7468,26744,4191,7890,634,19601,29892,1354,20554,3435,24792,7147,1671,21933,546,818,1597,1518,4894,663,9638,22781,29889,349,4664,1444,966,285,1572,29875,1465,443,623,29884,7598,2016,1465,27612,432,29915,1794,274,496,29948,553,288,311,1295,29889,2581,14111,5646,6267,20299,882,634,1444,337,15003,301,29915,24031,316,6267,17631,9552,18934,316,4048,6390,634,316,1437,18821,261,439,29915,4999,3435,966,288,311,1295,1750,410,2764,296,868,2174,275,381,29889,435,29915,7054,952,296,18158,3440,3058,267,7955,724,29878,2406,4105,284,29892,2123,23563,2318,267,316,26808,650,29892,269,29915,4925,1671,8556,410,2764,261,443,2174,275,381,29889,7137,17028,361,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,8031,3291,322,13917,1048,278,9443,1546,1560,514,322,15377,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,278,288,311,332,896,526,6724,338,376,12857,29908,322,376,1217,697,756,3926,2309,372,1434,29908,338,451,8072,6969,491,10757,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,727,505,1063,2846,11898,373,278,19677,8405,310,1560,514,322,15377,29892,727,338,263,15678,3573,310,5925,297,445,4038,393,14661,393,278,17294,29915,29879,20751,1788,338,16467,9024,304,13386,14399,9068,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,1158,3002,363,6724,278,288,311,332,1033,367,901,1788,2454,322,20704,29889,5806,372,338,11158,5526,292,304,14111,278,6030,310,27138,297,263,1855,29899,11526,4444,29892,263,901,12912,20657,7639,723,25135,640,22155,363,3651,1316,408,3578,292,29892,10430,29892,322,11462,11174,304,11695,403,278,2779,310,278,288,311,332,373,15377,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,1048,278,9443,1546,1560,514,322,15377,29892,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29889],"total_duration":109780097254,"load_duration":270812,"prompt_eval_count":261,"prompt_eval_duration":23547667000,"eval_count":261,"eval_duration":86231650000}
