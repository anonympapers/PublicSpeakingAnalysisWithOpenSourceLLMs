The speaker presents a clear and convincing argument for why their research is important and how it could lead to new treatments for hypertension. They use logical reasoning and provide specific examples to support their claims. However, there are some areas where the speech could be improved to make it even more persuasive:\n\n1. Emotional Appeal: While the speaker provides some emotional language (e.g., \"rassurant,\" \"danger\"), they could benefit from using more vivid and evocative language to engage the audience on an emotional level. This could help to make the speech more memorable and persuasive.\n2. Evidence: While the speaker provides some evidence for their claims (e.g., \"mes r√©sultats\"), they could benefit from providing more detailed and specific examples of how their research has led to new treatments or improved diagnostic techniques. This would help to build credibility and trust with the audience.\n3. Call to Action: While the speaker provides a clear call to action (e.g., \"il faut agir vite\"), they could benefit from being more specific about what action the audience should take. For example, they could provide a website or contact information for people to learn more or get involved in the research.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a strong and persuasive argument for their research, but could benefit from adding some emotional appeal, providing more evidence, and being more specific about the call to action.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1597,263,1540,29892,1444,325,1759,4880,261,443,938,14508,316,18402,269,29915,309,29889,7747,1750,2947,592,19172,276,270,29915,18560,29585,2298,270,29915,513,1575,634,316,8164,29899,5474,7199,9030,3440,409,13942,29877,4798,7015,21622,1295,29889,7747,1750,707,364,465,332,424,2535,5278,4439,328,347,29892,274,29915,342,712,1671,1410,4894,29878,29892,980,9378,277,925,29872,1465,454,325,4582,300,398,332,29889,11948,8164,409,27962,553,17478,11469,553,8595,10042,712,7890,2970,712,7814,380,7358,5278,4439,328,347,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,5819,10700,2673,1616,4894,1808,707,7945,1318,3700,782,9587,868,8714,29889,15113,7890,23532,29920,868,8714,1671,577,21216,5278,4439,328,347,634,2298,7890,11307,2689,29920,966,5161,1912,316,9073,29889,853,1029,404,29948,2123,443,2756,442,375,29889,3872,29883,980,21668,946,381,325,568,29889,8748,4883,6896,19718,1671,336,993,19172,276,316,1841,700,533,454,8714,316,652,11670,1387,634,8164,29899,5474,427,28920,316,534,8885,316,10984,2993,1020,667,1237,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,17953,3277,2980,363,2020,1009,5925,338,4100,322,920,372,1033,3275,304,716,7539,1860,363,7498,10700,2673,29889,2688,671,16667,24481,322,3867,2702,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,304,1207,372,1584,901,20408,294,573,29901,13,13,29896,29889,2812,327,1848,2401,29872,284,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,23023,1848,4086,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,26771,332,424,1699,376,29881,4600,4968,896,1033,14169,515,773,901,325,3640,322,3415,542,1230,4086,304,3033,482,278,20026,373,385,23023,1848,3233,29889,910,1033,1371,304,1207,278,12032,901,26959,519,322,20408,294,573,29889,13,29906,29889,7298,5084,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,10757,363,1009,16726,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,4467,6896,19718,4968,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,13173,322,2702,6455,310,920,1009,5925,756,5331,304,716,7539,1860,470,16710,652,21780,13698,29889,910,723,1371,304,2048,6625,4127,322,9311,411,278,20026,29889,13,29941,29889,8251,304,9123,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,263,2821,1246,304,3158,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,309,21668,946,381,325,568,4968,896,1033,14169,515,1641,901,2702,1048,825,3158,278,20026,881,2125,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,3867,263,4700,470,6958,2472,363,2305,304,5110,901,470,679,9701,297,278,5925,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,4549,322,20408,294,573,2980,363,1009,5925,29892,541,1033,14169,515,4417,777,23023,1848,25530,29892,13138,901,10757,29892,322,1641,901,2702,1048,278,1246,304,3158,29889],"total_duration":60301358105,"load_duration":192614,"prompt_eval_count":216,"prompt_eval_duration":18156462000,"eval_count":337,"eval_duration":42144326000}
