The speaker does a good job of presenting their research and explaining the process they used to create an artificial intestinal microbiome, but there are some areas where they could improve the persuasiveness of their speech.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the importance of the gut microbiome and why it's crucial to study it. While they mention that everyone has a gut microbiome, they don't explain how it affects overall health and well-being, which could make their research more compelling to a non-expert audience.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have provided more details on the potential applications of their research. While they mention that they hope to develop medications that can be activated inside the gut, they don't explain how this would work or what specific benefits it could provide. Providing more information on the potential impact of their research could make it more persuasive and relevant to the audience.\n\nLastly, the speaker could have used more engaging language and storytelling techniques to keep the audience interested and invested in their message. While they provide some interesting details about the bacteria they studied, they don't use any anecdotes or examples to make their research more relatable and memorable.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the artificial intestinal microbiome, there are areas where they could improve the persuasiveness of their speech to make it more compelling and engaging for a non-expert audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,289,627,4745,452,269,29915,14975,802,2331,782,3105,332,10283,293,1166,29889,6803,18729,29892,432,29915,1794,270,30095,1465,427,7017,8714,7019,1464,1089,553,289,627,4745,316,425,9115,332,938,342,979,29889,422,1004,980,302,29915,342,2331,1950,270,29915,12572,966,23532,1513,882,818,301,29915,524,14508,316,26814,9712,276,29892,980,21668,16454,966,1841,5231,29539,263,26231,634,1302,275,316,6628,1314,712,316,966,23532,1465,325,359,3209,3209,1750,263,337,1579,12973,2257,1750,409,21714,1465,26814,9712,276,29889,23719,1039,29892,432,29915,1794,2653,7019,1464,1089,17256,6063,316,29835,316,289,627,4745,712,5646,454,9122,3119,14785,634,8288,1162,5606,29948,1597,9115,332,938,342,979,19069,11381,1465,1601,10212,20141,29889,1459,425,9460,29892,301,29915,14056,7734,2535,22025,1444,6427,8284,2947,592,6299,381,316,3105,332,10283,293,20060,1671,712,1444,2653,5582,1243,261,6267,20744,1190,7814,289,24729,289,627,4745,29889,23719,1039,29892,2535,14984,7015,17124,6609,29892,432,29915,9983,1908,269,29915,29948,1464,1089,7814,3105,1295,10283,293,20060,1671,439,29915,2719,577,993,5039,1849,427,524,14508,634,712,29871,4277,409,24722,29892,818,301,29915,1062,14508,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,5925,322,24232,278,1889,896,1304,304,1653,385,23116,938,342,979,9200,5365,608,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,12032,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,13500,310,278,22341,9200,5365,608,322,2020,372,29915,29879,7618,1455,304,6559,372,29889,5806,896,3585,393,14332,756,263,22341,9200,5365,608,29892,896,1016,29915,29873,5649,920,372,6602,29879,12463,9045,322,1532,29899,915,292,29892,607,1033,1207,1009,5925,901,752,7807,304,263,1661,29899,735,10700,20026,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,4902,373,278,7037,8324,310,1009,5925,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,4966,304,2693,13589,800,393,508,367,5039,630,2768,278,22341,29892,896,1016,29915,29873,5649,920,445,723,664,470,825,2702,23633,372,1033,3867,29889,9133,4821,901,2472,373,278,7037,10879,310,1009,5925,1033,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,322,8018,304,278,20026,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1304,901,3033,6751,4086,322,5828,29873,7807,13698,304,3013,278,20026,8852,322,2437,2868,297,1009,2643,29889,5806,896,3867,777,8031,4902,1048,278,289,5761,423,896,12399,29892,896,1016,29915,29873,671,738,385,687,29881,4769,470,6455,304,1207,1009,5925,901,1104,17219,322,26959,519,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,23116,938,342,979,9200,5365,608,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,12032,304,1207,372,901,752,7807,322,3033,6751,363,263,1661,29899,735,10700,20026,29889],"total_duration":159746622248,"load_duration":304752,"prompt_eval_count":245,"prompt_eval_duration":26368280000,"eval_count":354,"eval_duration":133377454000}
