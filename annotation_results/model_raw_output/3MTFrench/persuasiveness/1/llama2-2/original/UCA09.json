{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T02:22:03.683238436Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness in crafting a convincing message. The speaker's reasoning appears to be somewhat rigorous, but there are some areas where their argument could be improved.\n\nFirstly, the speaker seems to be relying heavily on personal attacks and insults rather than addressing the opponent's arguments directly. For example, when discussing the opponent's book, the speaker uses phrases like \"il a pas du regardé\" and \"c'est un petit, c'est un petit,\" which come across as childish and unprofessional. This detracts from the speaker's credibility and makes their argument less persuasive.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker does provide some examples of how the opponent's ideas are flawed, they could benefit from more detailed and rigorous analysis. For instance, when discussing the idea of \"Tina,\" the speaker could have provided more context and evidence to support their claim that this concept is problematic.\n\nFinally, the speaker's use of hyperbole and exaggerated language (\"childs!!!!!\", \"ripples à distincte\") can come across as overly dramatic and unconvincing. While it's understandable that the speaker may be emotional about the topic at hand, this kind of language is not likely to persuade listeners who are not already convinced of their point of view.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some signs of rigor in their reasoning, they could benefit from more focused and nuanced arguments to make their case more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,325,1759,4224,5128,12416,443,20207,2331,316,25698,5000,29892,1671,712,1444,26099,1465,425,15694,6947,569,1671,454,3005,262,29889,2581,26099,2331,6309,29892,980,263,2331,868,4880,29948,29889,315,29915,14386,443,20207,868,19901,5218,29892,2257,1750,269,29915,932,1808,323,1099,29892,425,16549,316,4889,1671,712,1444,26099,1465,425,5782,29892,634,7847,868,5646,454,5246,712,5291,831,1750,29892,274,29915,342,443,17887,29892,274,29915,342,443,17887,29892,634,439,29915,932,7367,443,18811,2491,1354,5291,8121,267,29892,470,29948,371,2395,19601,712,432,29915,29874,2002,823,2679,29948,5646,2257,1750,302,29915,342,2331,3607,634,265,452,8164,2331,7808,25472,2526,634,1394,12884,347,634,5646,2257,1750,269,29915,4497,1372,9124,6685,1671,27516,553,3291,270,29915,29874,1693,270,29915,14382,454,5646,29892,3503,2278,29879,6824,21004,997,364,8377,793,818,8359,29872,29892,18331,301,29915,272,29949,1529,23449,2719,316,8192,270,29915,17045,767,14380,1249,267,454,8973,4241,841,424,29892,8556,302,4196,18741,5218,634,14852,8808,9379,1465,443,4110,4323,29874,29889,6101,11797,2453,352,296,8164,7890,8689,270,29915,348,4595,3209,29892,11797,20423,7890,8689,1738,341,21660,283,29920,585,29892,712,1444,8556,1083,29966,29989,567,29989,29958,1738,21989,29943,29892,7847,270,2526,8372,292,29889,26236,20600,868,236,166,178,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,5692,304,367,10579,12912,20657,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,2980,1033,367,16710,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,2444,304,367,337,5890,20365,373,7333,16661,322,1663,499,29879,3265,1135,3211,292,278,23995,296,29915,29879,6273,4153,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,5353,292,278,23995,296,29915,29879,3143,29892,278,25657,3913,12216,2129,763,376,309,263,2331,868,4880,29948,29908,322,376,29883,29915,342,443,17887,29892,274,29915,342,443,17887,1699,607,2041,4822,408,2278,728,322,443,23221,15750,29889,910,1439,1461,29879,515,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,322,3732,1009,2980,3109,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,947,3867,777,6455,310,920,278,23995,296,29915,29879,7014,526,17422,8734,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,13173,322,12912,20657,7418,29889,1152,2777,29892,746,5353,292,278,2969,310,376,29911,1099,1699,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,445,6964,338,1108,2454,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,322,429,9921,630,4086,4852,5145,29879,6824,21004,613,376,374,407,793,818,8359,29872,1159,508,2041,4822,408,975,368,8541,2454,322,443,535,3845,3277,29889,5806,372,29915,29879,2274,519,393,278,25657,1122,367,23023,1848,1048,278,11261,472,1361,29892,445,2924,310,4086,338,451,5517,304,20408,1943,11621,414,1058,526,451,2307,25617,310,1009,1298,310,1776,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,18906,310,12912,272,297,1009,24481,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,21309,322,4948,8362,6273,304,1207,1009,1206,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":75880138037,"load_duration":175246,"prompt_eval_count":268,"prompt_eval_duration":27250159000,"eval_count":359,"eval_duration":48629261000}
