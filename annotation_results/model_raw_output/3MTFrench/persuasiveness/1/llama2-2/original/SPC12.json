{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T23:21:59.213122227Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech in terms of crafting a convincing message and rigorous reasoning. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument for the importance of personalized medicine, using examples and data to support their claims. They also acknowledge potential limitations and challenges of their approach, such as dealing with incomplete or inconsistent medical records.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices, such as repetition (e.g., \"bêtes temporalités\") and visual aids (e.g., the comparison of medical reports to copy-pasted text), to make their message more engaging and memorable. They also use a clear and concise language, which helps to convey their ideas effectively.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve the persuasiveness of their argument:\n\n1. Emotional appeal: While the speaker mentions the potential benefits of personalized medicine, they could do more to appeal to the audience's emotions. For example, they could share stories or case studies of patients who have benefited from personalized medicine.\n2. Counterarguments: The speaker could provide more information on potential counterarguments or criticisms of their approach, and address these concerns directly in their argument. This would make their argument more convincing and persuasive.\n3. Specific examples: While the speaker provides some specific examples of medical reports and data, they could do more to illustrate how their approach could be applied in real-world scenarios. Providing more concrete examples of how personalized medicine could improve patient outcomes would make their argument more compelling.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a well-reasoned and well-structured argument for the importance of personalized medicine, but could benefit from adding more emotional appeal, addressing potential counterarguments, and providing more specific examples to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,11797,5697,1169,3435,270,29915,1175,29915,17073,267,29889,2661,29899,346,712,7890,282,6223,29920,26610,425,1667,1354,7890,8992,29920,20737,27883,443,25974,262,1577,478,681,452,4078,29920,8164,29899,5474,2331,29892,3503,818,2257,3256,29899,27048,29892,11797,4625,19694,443,13659,10283,936,1190,7890,29889,8748,1601,18848,1136,2488,818,1841,5231,29539,7015,19313,1671,13304,782,6628,1314,454,3105,332,1020,17334,4555,7890,7890,1841,18809,424,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,25974,457,15001,5711,1318,29889,1720,6025,344,25915,29892,1601,1203,361,316,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,17789,582,533,26814,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,461,1444,286,29915,29891,544,1975,1577,9353,301,29915,29882,30069,29886,2410,6722,1444,6427,8284,29892,8556,1029,787,544,29145,316,325,19680,6063,270,29915,19678,10283,28148,10961,29948,4555,544,29145,316,29871,29896,29900,14746,316,13659,29879,10283,293,2993,29892,9953,743,2535,19601,1465,454,2432,9874,868,4802,848,29889,6803,16455,643,7015,21880,29892,1444,966,1933,895,427,316,13830,5216,7545,29892,966,21880,2281,332,2406,634,966,21880,1661,2281,332,2406,29889,6803,966,21880,2281,332,2406,29892,2257,3435,553,19313,1027,2701,29892,13547,712,454,2245,868,10283,936,286,29915,331,558,275,2123,966,1801,1691,1473,7147,18475,296,993,610,454,16500,29889,12390,19313,3435,2258,21873,818,16455,643,1559,20554,3435,10961,2406,1465,427,1591,585,29889,853,337,3703,1173,1671,966,21880,1661,2281,332,2406,409,3435,966,13659,29879,10283,293,2993,29889,8748,274,29915,342,301,29915,627,29872,2123,2257,752,492,17851,29889,12660,16627,980,343,263,10741,4072,316,13659,29879,29892,553,1235,5888,29892,553,4313,392,375,316,521,381,2007,347,2123,316,521,12387,2123,10440,553,4356,3409,2925,316,12409,29889,11948,7015,1426,267,640,23510,553,19313,13499,262,5326,13547,712,966,13752,30000,6609,868,25974,262,1190,454,16500,2123,10440,966,2635,25766,553,3483,952,267,439,29915,309,263,1014,29875,29889,6803,16455,643,7015,1426,267,29892,1444,325,1759,3667,7608,553,3093,3751,4467,712,432,29915,932,514,1572,29875,2123,260,1169,29889,8748,427,22700,424,7015,714,2719,29892,1444,325,1759,316,7869,337,280,369,443,553,13830,1801,1691,316,301,29915,24209,344,316,1842,1750,378,2265,484,301,29915,1693,2450,553,289,22730,25406,7719,29889,9194,794,966,25974,1144,1750,4625,553,22069,1424,29948,16011,325,609,9073,553,5614,631,784,4237,2637,966,13659,29879,868,16500,1671,17161,261,1597,9637,316,1487,23396,10283,28148,29889,7747,1750,409,21714,610,17488,29892,7890,325,10281,14255,26814,25974,262,454,29871,29896,29945,8891,29871,29906,29900,29896,29945,634,7890,8992,29920,1597,285,1461,545,868,13137,634,1465,454,13659,454,25974,262,2947,904,699,276,29892,1444,2225,9695,29871,29941,3031,13116,316,29871,29941,3031,13116,270,29915,1131,295,29889,29871,29946,6063,2298,11364,29892,7890,20957,6096,1671,443,4439,316,330,3890,634,18916,980,2947,5614,631,784,1358,425,16549,24618,1377,29871,29946,6063,2298,260,9373,3503,7209,527,1803,276,425,2635,29889,951,25974,262,4323,7004,29871,4277,634,966,2793,634,425,1487,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,11948,454,2730,262,3503,714,309,4323,361,609,22272,2257,19696,371,29892,11797,325,609,7199,9030,712,454,25974,262,2947,1020,1524,26814,4439,316,330,3890,427,7890,977,424,297,1131,295,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,29871,4277,712,2257,16933,3058,882,9577,1411,818,659,631,29889,8748,1465,1601,714,309,29892,432,29915,1794,4021,29792,29871,4277,316,289,22730,25406,7719,29889,435,29915,1794,5246,1597,16455,344,316,7015,5614,4285,784,4237,1190,29871,29953,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1426,267,634,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,712,29871,29896,29995,316,7015,10701,16474,2406,427,289,22730,25406,7719,29889,8292,17856,818,4883,27965,1314,29871,29896,29900,14746,316,10701,29892,29871,4277,5246,16573,316,29871,29896,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1426,267,1750,3435,3104,296,18029,1098,5326,610,2257,289,1000,29889,3872,29883,274,29915,342,12866,443,6079,611,1324,332,818,23532,427,16731,7628,316,425,17789,4080,316,26814,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,10016,10098,712,1444,724,1794,15390,316,9073,29871,4277,29892,1444,1671,23469,1437,4951,381,553,20077,4072,610
