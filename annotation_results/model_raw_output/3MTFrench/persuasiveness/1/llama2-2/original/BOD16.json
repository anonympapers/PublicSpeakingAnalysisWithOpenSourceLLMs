{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T19:38:40.255373844Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker presents some interesting and unique ideas about the role of gel in the estuaries, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened. Here are some specific points:\n\n1. Clarity and coherence: The speaker sometimes struggles to convey their ideas clearly and coherently, which can make it difficult for the listener to follow their train of thought. For example, in the section on the recipe, the speaker jumps abruptly from discussing the ingredients to talking about the machine used to take photos of the phenomenon without providing a clear connection between the two topics.\n2. Evidence and examples: While the speaker provides some interesting and unique ideas, they often lack concrete evidence and examples to support their claims. For example, the statement that \"100 000 times more petits que votre téléphone\" is not backed up by any concrete data or research.\n3. Logical coherence: The speaker sometimes jumps between unrelated ideas without providing a clear logical connection between them. For example, the transition from discussing the recipe to talking about the micro-scope electronique is abrupt and does not provide a clear reason why these two topics are related.\n4. Emotional appeal: The speaker does not effectively use emotional appeals to persuade the listener. They do not use vivid imagery or storytelling to make the listener feel invested in the topic, which can limit the speech's persuasiveness.\n5. Call to action: The speaker does not provide a clear call to action at the end of the speech, which can leave the listener feeling unmotivated to take action.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas, they could benefit from improving their clarity, evidence, logical coherence, emotional appeal, and call to action in order to be more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,24337,9122,707,1083,572,347,316,9200,29899,6388,6386,29892,316,5697,1169,2894,1608,267,297,1730,13876,818,301,29915,348,329,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,610,17488,29892,707,1465,443,14961,1004,29892,980,343,427,263,9291,29915,30001,443,3533,29875,538,29889,9353,966,298,5137,2658,29892,274,29915,342,425,6701,12784,29889,2664,652,8678,743,29892,1750,3435,553,263,5475,29892,443,293,514,25290,29892,325,361,371,427,4595,2245,29889,2664,298,5137,2658,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,425,8691,553,9115,8842,818,425,9558,2637,18249,634,782,7019,424,29892,3435,1597,10640,270,29915,5753,398,2785,553,7019,9745,29879,29892,553,269,1849,634,553,1852,5475,29889,8748,1671,9364,276,427,28812,1465,966,298,5137,2658,29892,966,652,8678,743,274,29915,342,2181,1893,29899,348,9127,5541,29948,316,13830,6062,29948,21337,29889,11948,274,29915,342,325,17016,712,29871,4277,15210,26842,404,424,29892,2257,9127,22847,316,20081,364,30069,793,29889,1720,14924,13214,316,343,12301,1050,29892,316,269,29915,264,1365,7598,634,270,29915,264,1365,7598,818,270,29915,14559,9200,29899,6388,9230,29892,553,317,4345,5898,13618,316,1804,359,20674,3783,29889,1720,302,29915,29891,263,2331,1841,29885,2445,6311,316,409,410,6772,914,8474,966,472,941,1912,429,29899,1062,4745,1295,634,29892,427,4951,29892,316,409,2329,261,1190,966,7019,9745,29879,818,425,7101,553,367,1295,29889,11948,3440,1577,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,425,15963,1139,316,611,266,17449,29889,461,409,9127,296,17887,1006,351,381,2535,966,7019,9745,29879,1465,966,298,5137,2658,1577,478,681,4788,29920,592,1261,3825,1671,339,7768,707,29899,29884,29899,20146,18729,1577,382,29882,6079,29892,553,6896,19718,1601,509,296,439,29915,1540,2258,568,18618,409,9127,296,1465,966,7019,9745,29879,14924,270,29915,2987,358,261,10713,16165,743,1080,634,316,2485,1524,5162,882,10713,22500,1883,1080,29889,838,943,29892,3440,7199,9030,454,17889,316,2257,9127,1577,16579,802,373,409,5663,6223,782,17043,13639,5278,2723,275,457,29892,1661,1577,382,29882,6079,29892,14034,29920,1436,29892,980,452,1162,2353,316,2723,275,457,3503,818,301,29915,264,874,29889,478,681,8992,29920,454,1437,2265,2186,634,980,21668,1791,261,818,301,29915,1672,8618,29928,3120,29909,29889,24337,1162,2353,29892,425,286,681,344,782,521,542,324,271,316,652,8678,29948,316,301,29915,342,29884,1908,29889,9353,443,7017,8714,29892,7814,2348,29878,2487,10070,29889,838,943,29892,24145,9127,29892,7814,269,1849,634,7814,1852,5475,29889,11583,29889,24337,9127,707,443,24367,6184,13162,30000,13000,316,6062,29948,21337,29889,422,1004,1671,966,23778,29892,980,21668,12866,454,7175,862,261,29889,365,29915,1893,566,631,23068,818,553,6987,2927,29948,8774,509,293,29889,1174,6079,4595,3184,29889,315,3100,1804,28821,1027,2037,712,425,3581,20519,868,1243,337,1579,12973,425,325,898,749,316,23563,5541,743,29892,610,17488,553,410,6772,1475,29889,8748,1597,10098,29892,7814,2348,29878,2487,10070,1539,3780,10978,1671,9483,533,24145,1374,1690,290,8146,5469,29880,29892,980,8556,9378,277,316,2723,275,4983,24145,286,681,344,782,10212,20141,29889,11948,301,29915,264,4026,29892,24145,9127,29892,7814,1852,5475,634,7814,269,1849,29889,1174,13495,29892,8689,1354,425,1162,2353,263,18165,5483,1950,29889,1174,20744,29892,373,8164,23532,553,20612,868,1374,1690,290,8146,29889,10050,29892,1661,29892,1661,29889,10043,29892,980,2947,734,13745,561,7293,2011,519,29889,11948,2535,1597,4933,302,29915,29874,30058,371,2331,2298,2653,790,1647,29889,853,9200,29899,6078,19507,1617,1387,818,6411,388,482,29889,1720,14924,316,23532,427,15373,553,5446,1691,9577,5697,1169,29889,1954,351,4983,29889,29871,29896,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,10098,2298,5697,1169,712,26814,13745,6710,29892,925,882,29889,8748,966,1067,436,6544,3006,1041,325,609,19172,276,316,544,8885,712,24145,731,1766,1173,29889,951,9127,29892,2257,2329,29872,634,2284,267,784,2637,966,269,1849,634,966,1852,5475,29889,897,854,6096,439,7768,29889,24337,286,681,344,29892,316,652,8678,29948,634,610,29888,1249,29889,4241,841,424,29892,7199,9030,3440,454,9127,1006,351,631,2535,966,7019,9745,29879,707,2298,564,29123,29889,422,1004,6079,18484,2723,275,457,29892,373,1841,1558,277,425,1162,2353,29892,3
