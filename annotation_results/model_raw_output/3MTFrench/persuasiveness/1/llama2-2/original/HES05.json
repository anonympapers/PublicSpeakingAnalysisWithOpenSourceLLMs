The speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using relatable examples and logical reasoning to support their argument. They use the concept of \"projection\" to explain how humans are able to predict the consequences of their actions, which is a key aspect of planning and decision-making.\n\nThe speaker also uses humor and anecdotes to keep the audience engaged and make their message more memorable. However, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened. For example, the speaker could have provided more specific examples or data to support their claims about the effectiveness of planning in various situations. Additionally, the conclusion of the speech could have been more concise and impactful, rather than simply ending with a thank you.\n\nOverall, the speaker does an excellent job of presenting a clear and persuasive argument, but there is room for improvement in terms of supporting evidence and clarity of message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,2023,435,29915,3470,381,1004,712,8556,1047,4467,9411,2117,1849,316,544,2487,533,818,425,6003,381,29889,751,7768,1577,478,681,452,592,8182,4099,29920,2331,1577,2581,325,1759,7890,454,1437,3712,509,261,29889,6101,1444,544,1975,1601,13745,6710,4191,29871,4277,29892,634,712,1444,7890,992,347,425,1667,29892,712,2947,29899,29873,29899,309,409,27962,1577,2448,269,496,424,2331,29892,7890,28078,11867,1601,13745,6710,2947,6454,495,610,18249,634,8164,29899,5474,409,274,9498,29889,478,681,992,4099,29920,1577,478,681,29871,22730,5646,2257,439,29915,932,519,316,7175,7869,966,1136,21871,2063,270,29915,1540,3158,1750,452,872,277,2331,10440,12036,261,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,18246,29892,634,8556,3667,895,787,5278,11101,2131,9411,966,16283,427,28353,1671,23532,553,1437,3476,1080,29889,1459,17488,29892,1354,1444,2453,1314,623,7367,1601,26114,316,266,17449,29892,712,432,29915,932,1808,6079,10019,680,29885,358,9411,966,16283,29892,712,16374,29899,1324,9073,1577,1720,21668,712,1444,544,2487,14132,29948,966,2258,7844,29892,712,1444,454,1437,369,27537,1924,29892,712,432,29915,1794,1465,425,1841,1595,6390,29892,712,1444,14954,1173,443,954,10651,1465,425,13773,1671,427,4951,425,4639,29948,29889,8748,2257,455,29892,1671,18402,904,941,412,29892,432,29915,1794,5246,712,5291,1597,18246,29889,7747,712,8556,6003,787,316,9073,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,316,534,8885,1597,9460,270,29915,2467,1671,21609,19844,443,1203,361,29892,872,282,1808,425,3814,2450,634,454,266,5000,5882,316,611,266,17449,29889,4731,8105,882,29892,425,3814,2450,707,443,553,5354,267,6299,14075,316,301,29915,524,28286,19069,11381,29889,6340,263,3635,275,316,9484,261,553,10832,1862,4191,13704,29899,455,29889,6803,19449,1750,452,454,17043,19047,2331,29892,992,1654,28602,2131,29889,7747,19964,1120,265,608,1437,1066,29948,1190,16852,427,29871,29906,29900,29900,29946,263,4370,1437,6915,29948,980,343,263,13545,3031,13116,7907,29871,29896,29945,8595,316,289,787,904,2376,2993,5786,634,29871,29896,29945,8595,316,3814,2450,29889,7747,13180,29892,1671,712,872,3814,2450,18165,484,29892,980,21668,439,29915,309,409,7845,434,1465,443,12471,17239,13162,23855,882,1437,18821,29948,634,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,270,29915,14559,8820,712,966,269,22702,29889,5202,424,29899,20146,712,1354,301,29915,23071,8182,11728,443,7438,819,29892,18729,26030,4370,752,492,17851,29889,2598,18848,316,266,17449,707,270,29915,12572,2298,658,262,29889,315,29915,14386,29899,20146,316,29231,5495,1465,443,12471,17239,4292,1387,634,443,25456,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,3667,895,443,2428,29882,10651,270,29915,29882,3610,7289,712,7890,17043,5582,29920,9411,454,5147,345,585,3165,475,634,427,28353,7732,8774,3068,1608,267,29889,951,7017,29892,274,29915,342,425,4889,316,425,350,293,1151,29889,19551,802,1444,1437,29894,1064,283,1924,1601,24618,661,316,13745,6710,29892,432,29915,1794,5246,439,29915,309,427,5246,443,21285,270,29915,348,3256,4280,29872,712,1444,16623,316,26722,2298,2123,11387,1120,265,608,29889,1459,346,712,1444,301,29915,1794,5246,13547,944,316,10098,712,1444,301,29915,1794,623,3780,29889,951,18768,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,29948,4599,347,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,18715,13498,29889,435,29915,6698,1759,2653,534,8885,443,26713,3814,1671,12468,7367,1601,26114,316,266,17449,610,17488,427,544,27153,1487,954,10651,427,7853,277,2123,6079,427,337,841,424,1487,954,10651,29892,3503,4191,21394,316,26943,29889,2581,8182,11728,29892,1444,544,1975,1597,4963,918,425,2298,5119,1759,1647,29889,951,22448,29892,274,29915,342,425,3814,2450,4292,1387,29889,951,9122,707,427,4868,904,4068,634,29378,434,7209,274,5340,1671,409,343,337,2405,29889,319,20689,925,882,29892,1601,26114,316,266,17449,592,12468,1808,29889,2581,325,1759,3948,30037,357,611,3814,2450,634,286,29915,2749,30037,357,18916,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,25554,29879,263,17953,3277,2643,491,773,1104,17219,6455,322,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,2980,29889,2688,671,278,6964,310,376,771,6929,29908,304,5649,920,25618,526
