{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T02:24:12.198457656Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning, but there are also some areas where the argumentation could be strengthened. Here are some specific observations:\n\n1. Lack of clear evidence: While the speaker mentions some studies and research on the topic of canals and their impact on the brain, they do not provide any concrete evidence to support their claims. This lack of empirical evidence makes it difficult to fully convinced of the speaker's argument.\n2. Vague language: At times, the speaker uses vague language or makes general statements that are not backed up by specific examples or data. For instance, when discussing the impact of canals on the brain, they simply state that \"it's a good sense\" without providing any details or evidence to support this claim.\n3. Lack of clarity: In some places, the speaker's argumentation is not entirely clear or coherent. For example, when discussing the process of canals retreating, they mention that \"il s'arrête de se préparer\" without explaining what this means or how it relates to the broader argument.\n4. Unclear tone: The speaker's tone is not always consistent, and at times, it seems unclear whether they are trying to persuade the audience or simply provide information. This lack of clarity can make it difficult for the audience to fully engage with the speaker's argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas and arguments, there are areas where the argumentation could be strengthened in order to more effectively persuade the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,4942,545,1597,316,872,1506,275,339,2353,553,508,2993,29892,980,28078,27275,302,414,553,4224,3163,553,19507,3783,29889,8748,2331,553,269,1503,29892,274,29915,342,18097,6701,553,286,1862,712,966,26808,2873,2653,19047,439,29915,309,1671,12084,316,2257,29889,11948,274,29915,342,2257,712,274,29915,342,1577,315,29915,342,18097,966,508,2993,634,10713,5153,3163,29892,1465,454,3209,316,301,29915,29948,1376,634,2257,1750,707,2257,1750,707,2257,1750,409,16391,29889,6803,7199,9030,29892,966,2852,4749,743,8556,875,3906,316,301,29915,4422,4371,868,30883,316,301,29915,1893,7081,316,269,1503,29889,16932,4625,2257,1750,269,29915,342,1437,3364,29948,427,904,339,15943,277,361,1671,2257,1750,707,29889,365,29915,6406,8306,316,425,302,5582,707,15237,1190,425,5758,29879,2535,966,508,2993,29892,3503,1750,1518,9854,712,6267,409,2730,26665,1791,1249,409,1236,457,29889,2664,270,787,26379,1391,1169,316,4195,1465,966,26808,2873,4625,2257,1750,409,5246,634,1750,454,5147,345,585,316,269,473,275,1465,966,9744,29892,1444,302,29915,1794,439,986,29948,7017,29889,29871,29945,29900,29995,553,508,2993,380,1144,29892,29871,29945,29900,29995,553,508,2993,380,1144,29892,29871,29945,29900,29995,553,508,2993,1671,9073,553,10283,293,800,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,427,6267,3114,553,7537,743,553,1437,3034,690,553,1437,3034,690,29889,1720,343,263,553,10283,293,800,29892,980,343,263,966,282,2719,29892,966,282,2719,29892,966,26808,2873,29892,966,5273,690,553,1437,25389,267,29892,966,1998,316,2730,26665,29889,11948,29871,29945,29900,29995,553,508,2993,380,1144,553,564,16105,1959,29879,1661,29889,997,5758,29879,707,427,1400,267,553,10890,1671,553,10866,1953,29892,634,29202,29892,707,1480,1387,1671,19601,454,9080,29892,5646,4191,323,861,6150,235,186,162,454,17268,1190,454,15178,394,26932,1335,29874,29892,980,25810,1841,7501,29948,1671,966,3920,29996,28565,414,29889,6101,373,260,767,802,6079,316,610,1772,966,508,2993,29889,7096,818,443,26308,30140,15474,5056,10331,690,1190,454,6624,10917,744,29889,4088,498,583,19774,3435,427,2313,536,7015,5607,29879,634,10426,1136,324,4396,427,1671,274,743,279,2410,23131,267,454,1899,424,29889,8748,6079,8556,1029,787,25763,966,508,2993,5549,743,634,9038,17812,14913,707,782,4556,4464,839,29948,24145,26138,1518,9854,707,454,8714,439,29915,309,2906,336,427,409,7175,862,261,553,508,2993,1671,2316,1524,301,29915,6574,627,553,12286,29889,6803,2298,29892,966,508,2993,3435,1136,1237,712,260,29915,264,2906,336,7848,1437,18237,29889,6097,20564,29892,1597,10098,439,29915,309,707,18097,6701,8714,2637,425,4242,316,425,1153,4798,280,1190,611,22577,4464,29889,1174,2257,3256,29892,966,508,2993,409,544,2108,296,782,19666,270,29915,1540,22577,8691,316,425,3829,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,980,707,6668,17851,425,26823,1750,14924,782,508,2993,316,409,19860,261,818,425,1889,1924,29889,1720,269,29915,2749,9061,316,409,7175,862,261,634,980,409,652,8356,712,966,7446,793,634,966,508,2993,269,1237,634,553,22299,1750,269,29915,2749,30037,357,634,439,29915,2719,263,18679,1597,1083,279,802,712,425,8691,553,508,2993,1750,6267,14924,316,409,7294,2872,29889,6803,15093,904,1859,309,29892,966,4329,690,1750,269,29915,562,339,10978,316,409,282,26283,29889,1551,409,6427,8284,553,508,2993,29892,1750,14924,316,4224,5128,12416,443,13164,8774,3068,6386,1465,301,29915,14531,4824,1387,634,316,13942,29877,2496,553,534,1219,4637,29889,1720,8556,14924,316,325,9030,13260,8501,1465,425,18165,316,15243,634,454,1020,17334,316,5278,4439,328,347,29889,315,29915,342,443,10814,4771,29889,4702,455,21394,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,2266,526,777,2702,13917,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,777,11898,322,5925,373,278,11261,310,508,1338,322,1009,10879,373,278,17294,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,10225,310,29190,936,10757,3732,372,5189,304,8072,25617,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,29906,29889,478,3
