{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T23:12:52.960726507Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does provide some convincing arguments and examples to support their claims, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message could be more effectively delivered.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of concrete examples and metaphors (e.g., comparing the vast amount of data to a giant library) to help illustrate the scale of the problem and the potential solutions. The speaker also makes a compelling case for the importance of finding normals in the data to understand the underlying patterns and make predictions.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker mentions that the goal is to find the \"arche g√©ante-ervient,\" but it's not entirely clear what this term means or how it relates to the rest of the speech. Additionally, some of the mathematic models and techniques mentioned may benefit from more detail and explanation to help the audience better understand their relevance and application.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments and examples, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message could be more effectively delivered to fully persuade the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,425,5722,5458,1871,15819,8556,14924,270,29915,5474,9411,553,1051,22297,634,553,7175,7869,966,3105,1973,29889,4432,475,29892,425,5722,5458,1871,15819,2504,27280,316,9073,25595,358,634,818,325,23469,16784,2459,439,29915,1808,263,13260,8501,1671,25238,13639,301,29915,16063,473,782,3248,301,29915,6921,10042,454,28439,29889,29871,30219,29874,29892,432,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,409,610,1358,2298,11364,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,29871,4277,24853,2298,11364,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,966,269,882,7890,610,1358,316,425,7019,2764,2131,13977,327,1387,29889,997,301,2487,290,1808,263,4894,264,29892,373,8164,2852,566,631,301,29915,13624,270,29915,348,1029,291,29889,3387,29872,7907,29892,1487,472,357,5606,269,482,29892,3503,2331,25235,25595,358,1671,7175,7869,29889,6101,1487,410,14153,1700,29892,2085,424,443,5161,802,2123,2331,29889,435,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,409,1518,492,7808,6628,1314,29889,853,1029,291,270,29915,29948,3473,484,29892,27905,553,2298,4224,326,488,2117,371,332,1750,263,1072,22715,21394,270,29915,262,689,800,1190,9411,966,5541,1934,29892,1190,9411,7015,5541,1934,29889,6803,7890,27516,1597,1178,1318,29892,7907,23422,1597,540,545,270,29915,29948,345,1924,29892,373,766,10120,553,2298,270,29915,2487,290,3533,29875,3163,270,29915,1690,1590,690,818,21557,261,29889,315,29915,342,443,4880,269,29915,29948,880,1089,29889,1551,263,2002,301,29915,326,2590,270,29915,4582,1524,782,5246,1597,904,12324,29872,11721,6539,29892,5644,262,316,29869,818,22272,634,818,16455,643,29889,9353,7015,3533,29875,3163,270,29915,2487,290,29876,743,29892,373,14954,344,454,9122,553,269,30000,793,1750,2653,19047,7848,12536,743,818,553,20299,4110,818,6056,2993,29889,1459,17488,29892,443,923,4900,29899,264,29899,1182,681,802,29892,553,5694,1064,3698,29892,2123,553,3965,1080,1750,452,4079,7199,9030,439,29915,348,553,5541,1934,707,427,9703,29889,997,23520,553,20299,4110,818,6056,2993,707,1465,5278,13483,4323,2131,316,1661,29899,29876,743,29892,302,29915,342,2331,1044,27751,2331,1950,29889,7740,424,439,29915,1808,1029,291,29892,373,707,16374,1841,1595,381,443,13164,29889,11948,2331,553,282,3270,1912,2730,305,5908,970,29879,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,279,1173,10505,1647,29899,6972,993,29889,853,553,1203,10270,553,1775,743,29892,707,553,5178,2719,1749,267,553,13698,316,16455,344,25595,29889,6803,966,9073,29892,432,29915,1794,286,29915,262,1028,533,443,5190,270,29915,1540,1178,1318,29889,12545,634,6366,815,29892,443,2380,29889,1551,707,9411,818,301,29915,29948,10936,29889,1551,263,28643,443,2380,1671,17124,4630,25595,358,966,19313,29892,7209,289,1759,787,29892,553,22272,29892,301,29915,5128,6617,875,631,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,4422,895,966,286,30037,4467,3420,267,29889,435,29915,1794,1841,700,277,425,4323,2131,553,21880,3483,952,2406,1671,534,8885,25595,358,966,19313,1750,8556,26842,404,296,29889,435,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,12866,1671,10628,7869,553,13698,553,878,30000,793,5844,2249,19669,29892,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,337,4926,29892,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,454,878,15340,5844,2249,15819,29892,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,9484,261,553,878,30000,793,5844,2249,19669,1671,454,878,15340,5844,2249,15819,29892,5566,1509,29899,4346,29875,29892,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,1020,1524,553,21880,553,21880,553,21880,818,4883,21588,4546,29875,29892,2257,712,1444,286,29915,264,639,26308,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,17953,3277,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2643,1033,367,901,17583,20115,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,18387,6455,322,1539,12451,943,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,17420,278,13426,5253,310,848,304,263,28396,3489,29897,304,1371,28475,278,6287,310,278,1108,322,278,7037,6851,29889,450,25657,884,3732,263,752,7807,1206,363,278,13500,310,9138,6056,1338,297,278,848,304,2274,278,14407,15038,322,1207,27303,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889
