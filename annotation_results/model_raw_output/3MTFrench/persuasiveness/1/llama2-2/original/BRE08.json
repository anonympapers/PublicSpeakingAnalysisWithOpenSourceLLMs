{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T00:02:33.193514898Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents a well-structured and logical argument, using examples and evidence to support their claims. They also acknowledge potential counterarguments and address them directly, demonstrating a rigorous approach to reasoning.\n\nThe speaker starts by setting up a clear contrast between the traditional view of international relations as a monopoly of power held by nation-states, and the emergence of new actors in global governance. They then introduce their main argument, which is that local authorities have become important players in development efforts and should be recognized as legitimate actors in global governance.\n\nThroughout the speech, the speaker provides specific examples and data to support their claim, such as the recognition of local authorities' role in developing countries by the United States in 2005. They also address potential counterarguments, such as the concern that recognizing local authorities as legitimate actors could lead to a loss of quality and consistency in global governance.\n\nHowever, there is one area where the speech could be improved, which is the use of emotional language and storytelling. While the speaker provides some interesting analogies and metaphors, such as comparing the international system to a block of foie gras, they could benefit from using more vivid and engaging language to connect with their audience.\n\nOverall, the speech is well-crafted and persuasive, but could benefit from a more emotional and engaging delivery.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,8174,292,29892,3503,8556,1047,4467,31129,31207,818,5192,267,1842,743,29889,634,1597,13304,269,29915,342,6624,1318,29889,2664,8478,7719,1887,267,2062,2108,296,425,5758,29889,897,425,24159,29892,7890,592,2970,26477,1577,8748,6079,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29945,29892,443,14954,1173,332,17153,2529,4926,270,29915,348,20207,20827,634,1354,966,2778,14765,484,634,454,9122,29889,3387,882,29892,341,1078,14931,1190,966,15481,2167,270,29915,13453,29884,663,1750,20423,1539,2484,2637,23778,29889,365,29915,16061,707,553,8478,7719,1887,267,553,7628,712,553,6367,1080,553,11984,553,10402,4110,634,6701,553,11510,1336,6544,14864,454,7431,2310,475,782,24305,29889,2581,286,29915,524,29948,23458,2298,10816,3479,8478,7719,1887,267,316,22114,29899,509,283,1691,409,7691,29892,868,4595,29899,509,283,1691,409,7691,29892,610,346,439,29915,264,5246,29892,11797,3435,16530,20564,5039,1934,818,425,1775,5289,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,301,29915,1131,1829,316,1437,18821,261,29871,1654,301,29915,273,725,1288,4371,316,7015,1044,11620,1180,2993,26030,13545,7006,22786,743,454,1601,459,1772,770,1387,316,301,29915,16061,1465,966,5354,267,13547,712,301,29915,29874,680,553,1634,1237,29889,478,681,7890,26427,29920,8164,29899,5474,29892,3503,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,29871,4277,1735,712,2257,12852,301,29915,16061,2123,966,8478,7719,1887,267,1750,946,19047,1577,1720,325,993,1840,4983,13349,29877,1144,1597,22577,15690,347,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,4191,454,2373,29948,634,454,1701,347,867,294,29889,2581,7890,1518,9854,29889,1720,21668,6382,4983,425,20244,20110,4191,443,289,2029,316,1701,347,867,294,29889,8748,14864,966,13219,3842,4655,277,7147,553,5302,553,6121,267,29892,2257,289,2029,25810,5541,29948,270,29915,348,2348,29878,2487,819,5412,634,12852,766,424,2143,4983,301,29915,16061,29889,2448,25810,29899,346,439,29915,348,1804,27478,439,29915,1540,8478,2131,1887,25810,10918,21998,1671,1139,1089,1597,11398,20110,316,301,29915,16061,1577,315,29915,342,325,17016,29892,301,29915,21871,27445,868,286,585,1564,275,748,7425,29892,4191,782,6299,454,2373,29948,634,454,1701,347,867,294,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,8997,454,13222,553,8595,29871,29896,29929,29947,29900,29892,553,8478,7719,1887,267,286,8603,296,553,8820,270,29915,328,29948,1830,358,634,610,6267,1518,4894,663,634,6267,1518,1064,2938,29892,20554,409,3435,7275,2406,4191,553,8820,10918,277,1355,316,7015,24305,29889,8407,1298,6701,18097,29871,29906,29900,29900,29945,29892,966,5233,29899,11604,25238,790,10978,6267,17889,4191,7618,21101,1671,21609,19844,966,1203,10270,868,286,1924,904,1089,690,1671,454,24305,29889,23719,1039,29892,9811,342,269,29915,1144,9695,1465,443,1139,21941,21394,2298,2919,316,2257,712,8556,9411,6382,262,787,316,425,15306,749,14475,634,6701,425,15306,749,316,7814,9744,29889,317,4745,1314,29899,29876,681,2779,19882,1209,743,1465,1597,13752,17449,316,2373,29948,29889,8526,301,29915,3027,270,29915,1540,6894,2131,270,29915,627,11620,29892,8556,17078,1080,925,882,270,29915,1540,6894,2131,270,29915,348,4595,819,29892,7209,1671,1120,424,427,11113,276,4021,2131,634,427,748,7425,29889,8748,868,10814,2373,29948,29892,1444,1236,1314,7890,2970,29892,432,29915,264,7468,25016,29948,29889,4360,344,29899,3944,344,29894,424,712,553,3516,21158,29889,838,943,29892,1671,4048,6390,1354,301,29915,16061,18062,454,1539,2484,443,4323,2131,380,29948,868,9122,29892,19643,29920,29899,23088,818,611,13267,264,749,1465,443,385,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,4984,2955,322,16667,2980,29892,773,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2688,884,18145,5485,7037,6795,25699,322,3211,963,4153,29892,9004,1218,263,12912,20657,2948,304,24481,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,4444,701,263,2821,12814,1546,278,13807,1776,310,6121,5302,408,263,1601,13242,29891,310,3081,4934,491,5233,29899,28631,29892,322,278,11176,10238,310,716,29701,297,5534,4095,749,29889,2688,769,14944,1009,1667,2980,29892,607,338,393,1887,21142,505,4953,4100,10769,297,5849,14231,322,881,367,14831,408,25204,6490,29701,297,5534,4
