{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T02:05:04.889775417Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would score the speech a 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker is able to effectively craft a convincing message by using rhetorical devices such as repetition, metaphor, and parallelism to emphasize their points. They also use evidence and examples to support their claims, which helps to build credibility and trust with the audience.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. For example, at times the speech feels a bit disjointed and lacks a clear structure or flow. Additionally, some of the arguments and examples used could be more nuanced and better supported with evidence.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-crafted and effectively conveys the speaker's message, there are areas where it could be further improved in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,454,5419,270,29915,348,17887,7006,316,8714,29892,980,707,20450,29948,2535,443,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,17887,634,373,2947,3911,27516,443,1044,29872,1750,707,427,5722,5458,29892,634,980,2947,409,9073,9073,1597,25179,12973,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,1720,21668,7848,22588,29899,27048,29889,29871,238,170,158,239,161,139,374,276,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,263,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,491,773,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,29892,1539,481,2015,29892,322,8943,1608,304,19310,675,1009,3291,29889,2688,884,671,10757,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,6911,304,2048,6625,4127,322,9311,411,278,20026,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,472,3064,278,12032,23880,263,2586,766,12090,287,322,425,4684,263,2821,3829,470,4972,29889,19814,29892,777,310,278,6273,322,6455,1304,1033,367,901,4948,8362,322,2253,6969,411,10757,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,1532,29899,17293,287,322,17583,378,345,952,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,29892,727,526,10161,988,372,1033,367,4340,16710,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889],"total_duration":69266253213,"load_duration":222437,"prompt_eval_count":464,"prompt_eval_duration":43126586000,"eval_count":201,"eval_duration":26138833000}
