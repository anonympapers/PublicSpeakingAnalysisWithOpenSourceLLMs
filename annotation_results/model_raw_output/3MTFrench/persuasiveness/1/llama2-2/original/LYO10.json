{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T14:10:57.31476894Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker does a good job of presenting their research in an engaging and accessible way, using clear language and concise examples to explain complex concepts. However, they could improve by providing more concrete evidence to support their claims. For example, they mention the identification of a super protein that is responsible for the aged muscle phenotype, but they could provide more details on how they identified this protein and what makes it unique compared to other proteins.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker presents their research in a logical and organized manner, starting with an introduction to the problem of muscle aging and ending with a clear conclusion. However, they could improve by providing more detailed explanations of the scientific concepts they are using, such as the role of noyens in muscle function and the methods used to identify the super protein.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting findings, they could benefit from providing more concrete evidence and details to support their claims for maximum persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,452,26099,2331,22456,2379,314,514,29892,1444,452,26099,2331,270,29915,24039,2488,29892,1444,26099,29892,1444,26099,29892,1444,26099,302,2075,347,11196,332,631,4768,1189,2488,29889,2581,302,29915,1794,2331,24889,29948,270,29915,29948,2506,11542,316,3623,3703,344,3503,432,29915,1794,8164,29899,5474,24889,743,21907,12784,1750,7890,19172,336,316,1791,261,17222,29892,5162,634,367,585,427,4951,1671,23563,610,346,712,1671,966,5161,1912,29892,1444,7890,2504,1691,21181,3503,7890,7890,26427,29920,7209,270,2663,3440,1444,26099,6974,29948,18916,29889,28079,818,844,22687,980,343,263,4239,6063,634,23690,29889,435,29915,279,4401,427,1243,1465,1597,25740,1750,6427,8284,1190,454,2301,2841,707,851,347,818,2257,712,301,29915,19971,29889,315,29915,342,2301,2841,1750,7890,14924,316,7890,914,29892,19449,1750,3435,19257,818,14255,818,26814,885,29877,20200,29889,8748,19601,432,29915,29891,17043,275,7015,2331,4595,521,15806,316,2301,2841,634,432,29915,1794,325,568,7199,275,712,21394,18062,10440,818,4224,5128,12416,634,443,553,26379,16624,5908,22572,29915,15669,634,316,4048,6390,439,1379,3435,966,1044,11620,1750,325,609,4313,30069,1358,454,10814,24305,2123,10440,454,6316,453,11537,316,7814,2301,7799,29889,8396,18097,1444,610,280,270,29915,627,11620,1444,452,26099,2331,316,13137,282,568,2123,316,20179,360,481,475,29889,2598,24113,2535,553,2245,29879,443,7006,2298,2215,17206,375,29892,373,610,280,316,5697,3246,1667,29879,966,13949,439,29915,265,263,6701,410,6772,457,29889,3872,29883,1436,6311,274,29915,342,4497,329,316,1601,18848,29889,1605,6223,29920,966,410,6772,1475,1750,325,609,19172,276,3479,2301,7799,316,409,13942,29877,2496,29892,316,18165,1089,634,316,6316,453,381,1465,553,5855,5994,2122,29889,8407,9775,29877,432,29915,1794,12866,544,2487,4582,29948,454,2301,1810,5218,29892,1444,966,21206,283,1794,343,7468,1465,425,22577,1045,30058,371,316,9257,8532,316,1661,9411,966,18254,5632,1237,4555,20554,23997,3008,28230,1671,409,13942,29877,2496,29889,8748,7847,432,29915,1794,1841,5231,16555,14984,966,410,6772,1475,316,7015,3038,2540,2301,1810,7147,29889,315,29915,342,427,16623,424,443,3300,12621,2298,316,29871,29906,29900,29900,29900,29889,838,943,432,29915,1794,5246,443,23013,634,432,29915,264,7468,7019,1464,5483,2684,882,29871,29946,29947,29900,26695,1671,9073,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,443,274,11710,29889,29871,30219,29874,1136,2488,818,1243,261,1597,818,1597,521,562,1540,316,7015,410,6772,1475,29889,461,1444,16623,1577,435,29915,1794,3984,1190,4883,3038,2540,443,27666,1750,14924,316,1437,509,29884,533,805,4582,6832,339,882,1597,410,6772,457,634,7847,432,29915,1794,4880,29948,4883,3038,2540,409,13942,29877,2496,634,6316,453,381,7209,5278,410,6772,457,270,29915,524,1064,11992,29889,897,5278,2258,15529,432,29915,1794,2653,15882,1597,325,292,941,457,316,410,6772,1475,24151,1671,966,24305,2301,1810,7147,29889,11948,3711,19211,425,17949,270,29915,3470,375,14954,9947,818,1597,410,6772,457,1750,4439,28661,22527,1671,7890,1754,13990,316,17161,261,425,1661,2946,29889,8396,427,5646,3209,1354,373,24722,2970,5278,2428,410,6772,457,316,7814,3038,2540,2301,1810,7147,373,14111,553,26379,11482,1300,29879,1465,7814,2301,7799,634,25763,5646,2257,712,432,29915,1794,4880,29948,432,29915,1794,2653,8689,712,966,694,29891,2993,316,7015,3038,2540,409,337,2972,10978,1671,4642,553,626,575,29889,2664,694,29891,2993,409,3435,443,7006,966,6367,275,1750,4313,30069,29880,296,454,18165,17239,316,14984,7814,3038,2540,29889,360,29915,7308,4279,11797,3435,610,5444,17334,7595,743,29889,11948,18916,18097,373,6282,484,818,425,2428,410,6772,457,29892,10814,29892,553,26379,626,575,29889,8748,29871,4277,966,2301,7799,29892,11797,263,603,2331,9201,29889,315,29915,342,270,29915,8284,1295,443,11482,1300,439,29915,265,8164,22944,1465,966,3038,2540,2301,1810,7147,553,18554,9577,19406,29887,2406,29889,1551,623,1808,29871,4277,425,269,29915,5666,459,1690,347,1465,443,432,5022,29889,29871,30219,29874,5246,553,7067,19199,553,330,1503,29889,383,13469,29920,29899,8366,802,29892,454,22964,918,553,11101,7719,2301,1810,7147,634,626,575,316,694,29891,2993,29889,2598,302,29915,29891,3104,296,347,1044,2491,707,712,1354,373,16380,479,316,5278,2428,41
