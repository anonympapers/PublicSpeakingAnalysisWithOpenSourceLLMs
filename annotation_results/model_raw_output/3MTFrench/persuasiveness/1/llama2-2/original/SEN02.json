The speaker presents several arguments to support their claim that they can identify the age of a bone based on its acoustic signature, but some of these arguments are not entirely convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker suggests that the police could use ultra-sounds to identify the age of a bone based on the way it vibrates. While this idea is intriguing, there is no scientific evidence to support its feasibility. In fact, the study of acoustic properties of bones is still in its infancy, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between bone structure and acoustic signature. Therefore, I do not find this argument particularly persuasive.\n\nSecondly, the speaker claims that the police could use a new method of dating based on the composition of our bodies, which are unique to each individual. While it is true that our bodies contain unique chemical signatures, there is no scientific consensus on how these signatures can be used to determine the age of a bone. In fact, the science of forensic anthropology is complex and requires careful consideration of many factors, including the individual's diet, lifestyle, and genetic makeup. Therefore, I find this argument only partially persuasive.\n\nFinally, the speaker suggests that they could use their own expertise as a dancer to identify the age of a bone based on its acoustic signature. While the speaker's experience in dance may be relevant to some extent, it is not a reliable method for determining the age of a bone. Acoustic signature is a complex phenomenon that depends on many factors, including the bone's composition, structure, and history of use. Therefore, I find this argument only slightly persuasive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the speaker presents several interesting arguments, there is no single method that can accurately determine the age of a bone based solely on its acoustic signature. Therefore, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,2257,439,29915,265,7890,26427,29892,274,29915,342,316,3060,275,381,425,15378,545,5814,9233,29889,6803,2257,12852,19601,29892,1444,29758,4239,3987,29889,12852,818,9073,425,15378,545,5814,9233,29892,12852,1462,29878,4193,9411,966,10890,3022,1038,1237,29889,8748,610,4771,316,7015,610,5444,17334,3440,5291,831,7594,339,29915,348,7209,7848,297,6578,7342,610,425,15426,29892,980,9378,277,316,6079,439,29915,30001,14255,454,14913,634,270,29915,1131,9030,454,1437,11818,316,2225,699,1980,29889,997,2225,3395,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,425,2635,316,282,1064,296,10655,270,29915,314,814,545,29892,2535,454,8714,29892,966,758,29884,1960,480,267,409,1437,5105,296,1354,6079,7907,29871,29906,29900,6063,29889,11001,267,452,3435,2298,2414,29894,1849,19398,443,9434,17507,29889,8748,12866,29892,1209,743,553,301,30000,2710,29892,1444,26099,22024,339,1924,29889,306,455,7594,339,29915,348,16391,454,14913,10042,29892,29871,4277,409,752,9854,443,7006,29892,3503,1444,286,29915,262,6578,12973,2331,9201,29889,997,10974,2181,8332,295,2947,427,20744,2635,553,3966,744,698,267,29889,6803,4048,6390,1354,454,1437,11818,316,2225,699,1980,707,1209,29948,2123,1661,29892,3503,1444,17043,275,6267,8774,386,356,29892,274,29915,342,553,1418,800,20674,3783,634,20554,767,16011,316,16784,2459,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,373,707,5646,2257,1750,5246,443,29889,8748,425,15259,316,7814,15397,690,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,265,14857,7916,29872,29892,2123,10440,7814,4760,8192,20196,7147,29889,1551,263,553,11757,2925,29892,782,24165,29892,7814,6316,7545,2684,882,316,425,6701,26722,29889,8748,966,13930,1295,316,1418,800,3435,29202,316,10741,270,466,13116,270,29915,812,2406,29889,8748,274,29915,342,925,882,29871,4277,29892,373,6427,8284,29889,1174,11172,712,14954,14954,29892,373,409,24722,29889,315,29915,342,553,1437,11818,29892,425,10974,263,1841,700,533,5278,1766,1173,553,13930,1295,29892,427,16797,424,1597,15217,8774,386,356,316,1418,362,6079,2298,7175,3476,29889,8748,14344,29899,455,302,29915,342,2331,20674,1387,29892,3503,1274,18291,1387,2123,29875,29892,1444,2635,2535,316,425,15188,29889,29871,30219,29874,7890,904,880,484,1577,2169,19755,29920,966,1801,1691,712,425,269,595,21522,29889,1174,1045,30058,371,316,26245,29889,1551,6025,344,29889,8748,373,6025,344,2331,9411,316,425,6701,26722,29889,6101,980,343,13472,8146,712,521,562,348,263,1487,26138,3114,29892,29871,4277,12608,1190,425,282,2488,29889,382,29882,6079,29892,1671,4883,29344,11689,29892,427,4951,29889,15174,966,286,819,29892,274,29915,342,712,425,10974,2181,8332,295,592,3023,1240,707,286,519,358,29889,435,29915,1794,1083,279,17851,443,20299,882,1027,4233,533,29889,317,3011,347,443,3058,1134,316,15188,29892,427,301,29915,15693,26841,553,8494,336,29899,29879,787,29889,1720,409,1539,443,325,4626,29948,29889,8748,6267,25924,3435,1354,16530,4285,712,18729,29892,872,610,2016,818,316,425,6025,344,29889,9353,2257,1841,546,18734,2284,267,29892,2485,1524,1249,29889,1551,18593,316,7732,13994,439,29915,265,623,1808,24221,29889,323,943,291,634,4832,263,1355,29889,422,2590,29892,260,943,291,29892,4832,263,1355,29892,18402,2897,344,818,1487,3114,316,6025,344,29889,29871,30219,29874,26722,316,1841,351,381,3479,8494,336,29899,29879,787,29889,1551,623,1808,29871,4277,872,12608,1274,18291,1387,29889,435,29915,296,1975,20737,966,285,1893,2817,267,270,29915,381,283,1691,29892,3503,19601,1444,302,29915,264,26099,2331,9541,309,29892,29871,4277,263,14982,29948,541,316,29627,1318,29889,29871,29946,29892,29945,26893,868,1775,634,274,29915,342,325,17016,29889,365,29915,28323,868,6025,344,332,409,1841,29894,15340,818,13310,29871,4277,1465,2257,1750,722,347,29889,7747,301,29915,265,2665,782,9400,1054,2249,347,6722,3435,2852,271,9950,335,1041,29889,8748,6079,818,425,6025,344,270,29915,348,2897,344,29892,274,29915,342,5695,12377,29948,26791,29948,610,23563,1828,14228,4191,425,5469,868,22591,6722,980,263,7019,29926,2905,29948,29892,6722,454,8714,1750,425,1209,1249,5898,18249,29889,2598,541,29892,274,29915,342,925,882,316,592,432,9945,301,29915,13453,29884,663,316,2257,8714,270,29915,23578,283,11537,6722,11172,1400,29899,29720,331,1190,425,12608,1274,18291,1387
