{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T11:27:26.988596017Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker provides a clear and well-structured argument, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. This demonstrates their ability to craft a convincing message.\n2. The speaker provides examples and alternatives to illustrate their points, which helps to make their argument more persuasive.\n3. The speaker acknowledges potential criticisms and challenges, such as the difficulty of implementing these changes and the potential for blockages in diplomatic negotiations. This demonstrates their ability to consider multiple perspectives and address potential objections.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speech could be improved:\n\n1. The speaker sometimes uses vague or general terms, such as \"valeurs\" or \"démocratie\", without providing clear definitions or examples. This can make it difficult for the audience to understand the specific issues being addressed.\n2. While the speaker provides some concrete examples and alternatives, they could benefit from more detailed analysis and evidence to support their claims. This could help to build a stronger argument and make it more persuasive to the audience.\n3. The speaker sometimes relies on generalizations or assumptions, such as the idea that the European Union is facing an \"indifférence des citoyens\". While this may be true, it would be more persuasive if the speaker could provide specific data or examples to support this claim.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-structured and provides some compelling arguments, it could benefit from more detailed analysis and evidence to make it more convincing to the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,325,336,2073,2257,712,274,29915,342,712,425,16158,16909,347,1671,301,29915,28323,316,17950,29889,2581,29758,439,29915,309,409,867,15127,425,17949,29889,12390,1437,29876,2209,1080,752,1461,3783,9411,966,16283,29892,3503,1671,4048,6390,2257,712,274,29915,342,325,336,2073,29892,29871,4277,15210,21394,2298,1437,506,271,29889,9353,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,373,263,443,4274,1750,6309,712,301,29915,19986,707,6299,1318,1190,553,20368,1295,29892,4555,24145,16158,16909,347,707,24145,2852,271,316,17950,29889,751,392,373,263,3984,427,2058,15093,4274,29892,373,269,29915,342,6309,29892,1354,18413,980,343,263,553,2852,271,4110,1750,3390,296,2331,966,20368,1295,29892,373,2947,11469,301,29915,1466,868,282,680,29892,634,301,29915,19986,29211,2947,11113,276,427,2181,2487,13017,2131,20110,29889,1551,263,24889,29948,1597,1650,427,18926,424,2058,553,8774,3068,1608,267,316,4313,12161,29892,454,27965,1314,4274,29871,29955,29899,29896,29900,29889,4546,29875,29892,1601,1203,361,1465,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,1354,432,29915,852,2970,316,4313,30069,1358,454,4313,12161,2123,868,11387,316,966,20368,1295,29889,6803,409,9073,5646,270,29915,24430,29892,432,29915,1794,17134,301,29915,711,4026,868,4313,12161,29889,751,392,373,610,280,316,16158,16909,347,29892,610,17488,29892,373,302,29915,29874,2331,9411,966,286,30037,4467,26192,29889,951,17284,427,26379,2947,707,4193,712,425,16158,16909,347,274,29915,342,7848,904,6092,29889,8748,7847,1597,10098,712,7890,29871,22730,904,6092,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,9073,4963,942,5646,2257,712,7890,28078,11867,29889,3872,29883,1671,1437,4951,381,553,1437,4951,2187,2298,782,11387,1136,575,2491,316,7015,451,1080,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,3479,1426,267,16772,29876,1379,316,521,562,348,553,2852,271,4110,29892,3503,5695,782,18848,868,3623,479,4797,1465,966,6361,1041,712,1444,286,29915,18949,4637,634,782,18848,868,3623,479,17611,264,29889,1551,18331,2298,782,11387,818,11469,553,1437,4951,2187,316,23563,20368,1295,29892,14864,966,3300,861,553,266,2249,19669,29892,274,29915,342,2331,2258,21873,29892,1661,29892,6836,18331,29889,1551,18331,818,1597,18768,1139,21394,2298,7930,457,1509,29889,951,4313,12161,1465,301,29915,13094,18165,484,29899,29873,29899,309,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,11878,301,29915,28661,29889,10050,29889,10050,29892,610,346,712,782,13003,316,9073,1970,8837,818,443,3623,479,29892,373,263,5246,1970,8837,782,17284,553,2852,271,4110,1671,4313,30069,1358,29889,1551,623,1808,29871,4277,454,4313,12161,11398,29889,1720,409,1841,348,5582,1465,1597,6815,2930,10491,634,980,6309,818,15093,4698,737,818,425,1702,391,1103,261,966,20368,1295,316,301,29915,13094,29889,20513,499,271,29889,28266,29871,29929,17478,29892,425,1248,9599,263,3984,818,301,29915,442,8356,316,270,29915,2696,1575,553,1644,13116,316,3623,479,29892,610,346,439,29915,2719,452,3928,6381,993,2331,782,9982,333,1064,271,271,868,19397,427,2058,29889,2664,15306,4110,3435,1841,348,275,29889,1551,263,3984,553,1067,2518,30019,787,29158,4999,29892,10440,11387,270,29915,2467,1671,301,29915,326,351,4983,29889,1459,346,712,29892,2257,343,263,553,289,2029,1179,13487,19669,29889,3872,29883,1444,592,26099,6309,29892,1444,325,1759,3686,2747,18097,6701,316,5814,5893,4239,29892,7732,27809,29889,1459,17488,29892,301,29915,13094,1436,749,553,410,27499,1465,521,562,348,553,2852,271,4110,29889,6803,339,7768,452,2331,3581,546,454,696,915,29899,262,29899,3470,262,27967,1671,966,2852,271,4110,1750,452,3390,10978,2331,966,20368,1295,316,301,29915,13094,29973,2581,16193,553,27809,29889,365,29915,524,1064,11992,1671,8556,427,11172,712,274,2049,11771,707,904,12324,29872,29889,315,29915,342,316,4048,6390,6722,8556,599,787,29889,365,29915,524,1064,11992,1671,301,29915,13094,29211,707,8648,29403,29889,1459,346,439,29915,30001,1601,4771,29892,454,26379,25698,5000,316,301,29915,13094,29211,29892,274,29915,342,2331,454,5826,29916,277,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,513,2593,1064,663,553,274,2049,29891,575,29889,1551,454,24722,2535,966,27254,17611,9387,1750,269,29915,9961,305,296,634,1750,452,302,29915,351,568,2331,363,29883,15471,966,285,681,29889,10793,15373,29892,274,29915,342,553,10419,800,15237,427,629,275,29
