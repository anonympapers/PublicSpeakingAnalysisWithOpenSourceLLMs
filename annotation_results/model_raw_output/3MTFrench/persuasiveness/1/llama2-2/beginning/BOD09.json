The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker begins by sharing their personal experience as a PhD student and a pedagogical consultant, which helps to establish their credibility and expertise on the topic. However, they do not provide enough evidence or logical reasoning to support their claim that the university's current system is inadequate and needs to be transformed.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that the university's current system is focused on transmitting knowledge rather than centering it on the students themselves, but they do not provide any specific examples or data to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker does not offer any concrete solutions or alternatives to the current system, which makes their argument feel somewhat incomplete.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a valid concern about the university's current system, their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported to make a stronger case for transformation.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,301,29915,4548,4894,663,29889,349,4664,802,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,611,266,17449,29892,1444,592,4771,443,7006,2257,439,29915,2719,782,5435,29899,27048,29889,2581,26099,270,29915,585,312,5411,1647,427,18768,19951,29889,11948,1444,26099,5695,5178,453,1908,8939,13247,1387,818,301,29915,26759,316,425,1528,305,1808,29889,8748,818,2257,13275,29892,1444,16623,8691,316,1601,11107,270,29915,26739,800,29889,438,14340,6972,17417,29892,29871,4277,2947,7848,980,269,29915,26739,29948,29889,315,29915,342,2331,2258,21873,818,330,29539,9411,966,16283,29889,1174,8714,29892,5178,453,1908,8939,13247,1387,29892,432,29915,562,2388,5889,966,23930,647,1934,316,301,29915,26759,1465,425,13852,316,6267,544,15819,29889,11948,270,3246,29899,4346,29875,29892,7594,707,301,29915,29882,30069,1467,316,301,29915,1947,647,882,13159,14508,22572,29915,15669,29973,29871,30219,29874,9484,12470,29892,1465,1601,4946,2131,29892,373,16133,1908,712,301,29915,264,1324,29884,707,16089,2131,301,29915,3742,814,291,6351,9139,270,29915,348,2298,4595,5419,270,29915,1893,4749,1934,29889,1174,7705,27751,29892,373,1040,403,712,24145,21423,270,29915,1947,647,882,282,8146,818,25497,276,818,443,13547,427,1324,29884,29892,2535,553,2852,4749,1934,1750,9411,966,26943,1750,316,301,29915,26759,269,29915,355,277,715,2932,29892,2123,1750,452,16391,2331,270,29915,13141,275,818,425,447,19072,316,6267,4021,2450,29889,1720,707,12866,5065,5362,1671,301,29915,26759,316,409,4327,261,29889,10793,13852,1634,852,1190,443,23930,647,882,1644,5606,1661,2298,1190,454,4048,6390,29892,3503,1190,966,2852,4749,1934,3911,29899,18202,29889,1281,7283,23855,882,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,29871,4277,1804,28821,29973,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,16410,491,19383,1009,7333,7271,408,263,1963,29928,8368,322,263,8939,13247,936,8799,424,29892,607,6911,304,10127,1009,6625,4127,322,17924,895,373,278,11261,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,16372,29915,29879,1857,1788,338,297,1943,339,403,322,4225,304,367,27615,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,16372,29915,29879,1857,1788,338,21309,373,18750,5367,7134,3265,1135,1644,3241,372,373,278,8041,6053,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,947,451,5957,738,18387,6851,470,27809,304,278,1857,1788,29892,607,3732,1009,2980,4459,10579,28907,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2854,5932,1048,278,16372,29915,29879,1857,1788,29892,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,304,1207,263,23505,1206,363,13852,29889],"total_duration":57462810340,"load_duration":200256,"prompt_eval_count":339,"prompt_eval_duration":28481073000,"eval_count":238,"eval_duration":28981043000}
