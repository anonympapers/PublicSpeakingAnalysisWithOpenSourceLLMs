{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T10:02:51.611383528Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker's message is not particularly convincing or well-reasoned, as they appear to be meandering and not making a clear argument. The speaker also uses some fallacious reasoning, such as the appeal to tradition (e.g., \"But the maman has learned a world of wants, to play with pâte à moudler and even to knit.\") without providing any logical evidence to support their claims. Additionally, the speaker's use of metaphors and analogies is not particularly effective in conveying their message.\n\nOn the scale described in the question, I would score the speech as follows:\n\n* Persuasiveness: 3/5\n* Rigor of reasoning: 2/5\n\nNote: The above evaluation is based on a subjective assessment of the transcript provided and may vary depending on individual perspectives and criteria.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,12069,339,29915,1794,443,1147,276,427,19183,347,29889,28756,29892,439,29915,1808,409,1437,6718,484,29889,1551,263,9411,553,19462,316,5697,1169,2174,275,381,1465,1597,21824,1318,29889,478,681,302,29915,29874,603,29920,29899,23088,2331,427,1365,7598,443,19696,371,6722,818,26814,472,29878,2249,29948,29973,8748,7890,302,29915,29874,603,29920,29899,23088,2331,818,8121,261,1597,8691,316,24354,29888,449,267,2535,325,359,21038,29973,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,454,2578,29926,473,286,13533,263,623,3780,443,9122,316,2453,1314,29892,818,8121,261,818,425,282,10870,818,286,2736,1358,634,6701,818,534,293,17084,29889,7747,1750,707,11468,262,424,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,24031,316,3999,5039,7719,16253,3246,425,7175,9454,316,425,1667,29892,1750,707,454,5246,316,872,275,381,553,5446,1691,29889,2664,22109,1171,695,743,29892,454,7446,346,29889,11948,301,29915,21642,29892,634,17039,545,29892,966,447,8842,818,301,29915,524,14508,316,24145,772,647,1318,29892,325,609,6282,1089,29889,7747,1437,13974,2265,409,18750,1803,276,454,25924,443,7006,4191,1597,2085,1318,3983,603,4046,29878,1318,29889,853,17103,16530,1908,2637,4239,447,8842,707,818,301,29915,28522,29892,29871,1654,1671,1597,1721,1808,29899,1131,354,29899,29894,26493,1465,454,286,1600,332,634,301,29915,29882,30069,5698,17449,29889,1720,409,3435,1083,27224,743,29892,301,29915,348,610,13659,818,301,29915,18288,29892,8997,553,3533,29948,1056,2658,29889,405,681,19172,787,425,2298,6815,1197,7342,316,25924,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,10734,17953,3277,470,1532,29899,23147,287,29892,408,896,2615,304,367,592,392,3241,322,451,3907,263,2821,2980,29889,450,25657,884,3913,777,285,9864,8802,24481,29892,1316,408,278,25530,304,11399,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,6246,278,286,13533,756,10972,263,3186,310,10753,29892,304,1708,411,282,10870,818,286,2736,1358,322,1584,304,889,277,23157,1728,13138,738,16667,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,1539,12451,943,322,15690,583,338,451,10734,11828,297,378,345,5414,1009,2643,29889,13,13,2951,278,6287,5439,297,278,1139,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,4477,29901,13,13,29930,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,29871,29941,29914,29945,13,29930,390,335,272,310,24481,29901,29871,29906,29914,29945,13,13,9842,29901,450,2038,17983,338,2729,373,263,4967,573,24809,358,310,278,1301,924,4944,322,1122,13100,8679,373,5375,3736,1103,3145,322,16614,29889],"total_duration":53644051217,"load_duration":311267,"prompt_eval_count":304,"prompt_eval_duration":25749530000,"eval_count":215,"eval_duration":27893670000}
