The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and parallelism to drive home their message, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by using a vivid image to capture the audience's attention, \"Ce que vous voyez juste derri√®re moi, c'est un tron noir.\" They then go on to explain that this object is optically invisible, which creates an intriguing mystery. However, the speaker's argument could be strengthened by providing more scientific evidence or expert opinions to support their claim.\n\nThe speaker also uses a clever play on words by saying \"Je suis juriste, mais je choisis de me taire\" to emphasize their point that the concept of a black hole is not just a scientific phenomenon but also a social and political one. However, this analogy could be further developed to make it more compelling.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas and uses effective rhetorical devices, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by evidence. Therefore, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,7747,712,7890,992,4099,29920,925,29872,589,9318,19601,29892,274,29915,342,443,534,265,694,381,29889,853,13413,19489,4196,1750,263,1671,3153,2131,270,29915,5474,5695,11071,29872,29892,1750,301,29915,3451,30037,1173,12563,13618,316,19703,5289,316,7015,10708,29948,29889,1551,6309,316,3911,439,29915,309,707,3523,8105,882,27597,29889,2581,452,26099,2331,8717,307,14017,293,7081,29889,2581,452,16623,2331,316,4824,1387,4323,1387,6836,6701,316,5844,2249,19669,29889,1522,20168,270,29915,14056,7890,4516,296,443,7006,270,29915,5474,712,1444,452,26099,6701,2331,1597,9638,22781,29889,2581,26099,11099,2488,29889,11948,432,29915,1794,3060,10770,316,1136,562,5606,1050,270,29915,28619,11062,895,29892,443,13413,1750,1437,7241,5646,1120,424,29889,951,4771,3817,439,29915,348,534,265,694,381,707,1750,3911,5695,29892,427,432,29915,14056,443,28205,19726,545,29892,425,8475,29889,15113,16530,20564,29892,432,29915,1794,868,6309,301,29915,29948,23445,2637,454,1437,841,29884,634,425,1375,8306,26520,277,663,332,29889,365,29915,296,355,29892,454,1437,841,29884,707,904,1052,29792,270,29915,465,688,29948,29899,29873,29899,309,782,2669,970,29973,1720,707,639,24359,4191,1597,26744,3669,29885,895,818,425,1375,8306,29892,20881,29654,316,2225,699,1980,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,270,29915,711,3473,362,782,1559,309,16374,409,14670,261,5898,1236,457,316,9753,428,29889,8526,301,29915,735,331,552,868,2174,13561,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,4422,275,13326,21735,29892,6722,966,11695,261,868,11107,634,6722,980,707,5999,29948,270,29915,11236,2131,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,8943,1608,304,7899,3271,1009,2643,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,773,263,325,3640,1967,304,10446,278,20026,29915,29879,8570,29892,376,29907,29872,712,7890,992,4099,29920,925,29872,589,9318,19601,29892,274,29915,342,443,534,265,694,381,1213,2688,769,748,373,304,5649,393,445,1203,338,3523,1711,27597,29892,607,10017,385,11158,5526,292,29236,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,16021,10757,470,17924,26971,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,3913,263,23455,1708,373,3838,491,5934,376,13836,26099,11099,2488,29892,3503,1444,3060,15773,316,592,260,5218,29908,304,19310,675,1009,1298,393,278,6964,310,263,4628,16188,338,451,925,263,16021,27791,265,541,884,263,5264,322,8604,697,29889,2398,29892,445,3483,6933,1033,367,4340,8906,304,1207,372,901,752,7807,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,3913,11828,364,9188,272,936,9224,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,10757,29889,7857,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":146109028020,"load_duration":266783,"prompt_eval_count":317,"prompt_eval_duration":37194708000,"eval_count":285,"eval_duration":108913457000}
