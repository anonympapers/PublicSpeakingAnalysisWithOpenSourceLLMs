{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T02:27:43.810577474Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. The speaker seems to be struggling with clarity and coherence, often repeating phrases or ideas without fully developing them. This makes it difficult to follow their train of thought and evaluate their argumentation.\n\nThe speaker also appears to be using a lot of filler words and phrases, such as \"я не знаю,\" \"что я не знаю,\" and \"не значит.\" While these can be used to convey uncertainty or hesitation, they can also make the speaker's message feel unclear or uncertain.\n\nThere are some moments where the speaker seems to be trying to be funny or clever, but these moments are few and far between, and they do not necessarily contribute to a coherent or persuasive argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker is not completely unpersuasive, their message could benefit from more clarity, coherence, and rigorous reasoning in order to be more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,606,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,8709,292,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,8573,302,5512,24032,631,30641,30641,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,443,2786,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,1077,26831,29970,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,13074,853,8485,406,264,29892,4281,2282,7412,20893,29891,29892,4281,2282,606,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,3574,1498,15515,10477,490,28461,2815,23334,29919,29889,18512,6041,1584,591,3802,373,591,1016,29915,29873,1584,2041,304,278,3186,541,372,29915,645,4556,366,1363,1906,526,278,6743,310,502,278,3186,310,278,3186,29889,30665,30364,8082,29871,239,154,183,4449,3029,232,176,172,29889,8616,23674,29932,29892,531,1843,1325,1782,382,5990,29889,665,8160,642,5524,239,163,139,10502,29892,10835,469,1930,29957,1499,717,6517,606,6414,29981,29872,1335,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,2444,304,367,20042,411,7542,537,322,16165,261,663,29892,4049,28769,12216,2129,470,7014,1728,8072,14338,963,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,322,14707,1009,2980,362,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,5692,304,367,773,263,3287,310,5445,261,3838,322,12216,2129,29892,1316,408,376,29970,1538,6253,30005,1699,376,29981,702,2282,1538,6253,30005,1699,322,376,821,23674,29932,1213,5806,1438,508,367,1304,304,27769,25812,470,19066,7018,29892,896,508,884,1207,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,4459,20871,470,17999,29889,13,13,8439,526,777,19462,988,278,25657,2444,304,367,1811,304,367,2090,1460,470,23455,29892,541,1438,19462,526,2846,322,2215,1546,29892,322,896,437,451,12695,29126,304,263,16165,261,296,470,20408,294,573,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,338,451,6446,443,6774,29884,294,573,29892,1009,2643,1033,14169,515,901,7542,537,29892,16165,261,663,29892,322,12912,20657,24481,297,1797,304,367,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":84804643492,"load_duration":178392,"prompt_eval_count":497,"prompt_eval_duration":52528655000,"eval_count":236,"eval_duration":32275274000}
