The speaker presents a novel idea for harnessing thermoelectricity to generate electricity, which is a fascinating concept. However, the presentation could be improved in several areas:\n\n1. Lack of clarity: At times, the speaker's explanation becomes vague or hard to follow due to the use of technical terms without proper explanation or context. For instance, the term \"nano-particules\" is used without further elaboration on what they are or how they work.\n2. Insufficient evidence: The speaker mentions that the idea of using thermoelectricity to generate electricity is not new, but provides no concrete examples or scientific studies to support their claim. This makes it difficult to assess the feasibility of the proposed solution.\n3. Lack of rigor: The speaker's reasoning is sometimes based on simplistic assumptions or logical fallacies, such as assuming that the temperature difference between the inside and outside of a device can be used to generate electricity without providing any scientific basis for this claim.\n4. Unclear visuals: The images provided are not clearly related to the speech or the proposed solution, making it difficult to understand how they support the speaker's argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some creativity and enthusiasm for their idea, the presentation could benefit from more clarity, evidence, and rigor in their reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1551,17043,13871,9411,5278,904,517,362,29889,1551,263,3008,28230,270,29915,348,14857,13745,6710,29892,3503,425,10193,347,707,325,568,29889,315,29915,342,427,289,29948,880,29892,373,707,425,14913,29889,8748,818,18402,10098,29892,1444,592,26099,6309,29892,29871,4277,25810,6079,316,19397,904,4630,29887,381,1601,13745,6710,2535,1597,2752,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,15237,26318,29889,8748,980,452,21668,2331,904,4630,29887,381,9577,658,262,29889,24337,3104,29892,4875,707,15237,521,356,29892,4837,29892,29871,29941,29900,29892,29871,29946,29900,867,29892,634,301,29915,1466,1294,14508,2225,802,15237,2298,10098,29889,315,29915,342,5278,12694,663,316,5694,19113,29889,2581,2453,1314,4327,261,427,19507,2200,2131,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,29871,4277,269,29915,932,1808,425,14563,29877,29899,29948,2506,2200,2131,29889,8748,4191,7890,992,4099,29920,1190,1601,1967,29892,443,8323,332,1559,1601,19507,14090,29892,818,15237,443,21384,10329,566,634,443,21384,285,1007,29892,4191,1597,8230,29892,443,21384,2298,634,443,21384,19601,29889,8748,966,4239,274,9373,743,29892,11797,3435,7019,862,743,610,443,1775,4894,29877,29889,8748,7015,1775,4894,29877,29892,274,29915,342,454,1302,5411,316,1775,29948,911,29889,11948,316,454,10135,374,7808,29892,274,29915,342,325,336,2073,2331,2258,21873,29889,2598,1178,1318,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,4422,7608,553,302,1562,29899,1595,293,2540,9151,2406,29889,8748,274,29915,14386,26379,344,16380,280,694,533,1190,1601,1967,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,9554,2969,363,4023,2264,292,14563,7297,781,2200,537,304,5706,12646,537,29892,607,338,263,21028,262,1218,6964,29889,2398,29892,278,24329,1033,367,16710,297,3196,10161,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,8252,7415,25160,470,2898,304,1101,2861,304,278,671,310,16905,4958,1728,1571,8252,470,3030,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,1840,376,29876,1562,29899,1595,293,2540,29908,338,1304,1728,4340,13771,362,373,825,896,526,470,920,896,664,29889,13,29906,29889,512,2146,4543,10757,29901,450,25657,26649,393,278,2969,310,773,14563,7297,781,2200,537,304,5706,12646,537,338,451,716,29892,541,8128,694,18387,6455,470,16021,11898,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,24809,278,28326,4127,310,278,7972,1650,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,12912,272,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,6041,2729,373,5466,4695,20813,470,16667,285,9864,2478,29892,1316,408,10241,393,278,10430,4328,1546,278,2768,322,5377,310,263,4742,508,367,1304,304,5706,12646,537,1728,13138,738,16021,8405,363,445,5995,29889,13,29946,29889,853,8551,7604,29879,29901,450,4558,4944,526,451,9436,4475,304,278,12032,470,278,7972,1650,29892,3907,372,5189,304,2274,920,896,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,907,28157,322,23644,3173,29885,363,1009,2969,29892,278,24329,1033,14169,515,901,7542,537,29892,10757,29892,322,12912,272,297,1009,24481,29889],"total_duration":66550621053,"load_duration":287910,"prompt_eval_count":294,"prompt_eval_duration":24859510000,"eval_count":324,"eval_duration":41690198000}
