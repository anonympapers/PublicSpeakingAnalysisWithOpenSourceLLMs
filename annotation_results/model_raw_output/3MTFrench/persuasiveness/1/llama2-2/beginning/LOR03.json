{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T21:35:12.230000703Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker uses some emotional appeals to make their argument more convincing, such as the use of the phrase \"la méchant de sourcière\" to describe the cancer cells and the image of a key to open the cancerous tumor. However, the speech lacks a clear and compelling central message, and the speaker's claims are not always supported by evidence or logical reasoning. For example, the statement that \"nobody knows seriously\" about the third form of breast cancer undermines the speaker's credibility and makes their argument less persuasive.\n\nReasoning: The speaker's reasoning is sometimes flawed or based on unproven assumptions. For instance, the claim that explosives like terrapin therapy can be used to soothe breast cancer is not supported by scientific evidence and seems unlikely to be effective. Additionally, the speaker's use of metaphors and analogies can be confusing and distract from their main argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker tries to make their argument more convincing with emotional appeals and vivid imagery, the lack of clear evidence and logical reasoning makes the speech less persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,6303,1597,10098,1597,23251,344,1750,9364,1249,427,10311,9599,2535,1487,14913,29889,853,8694,29892,4191,818,1487,2299,4279,29892,4875,269,29915,6698,424,6309,14255,454,25974,262,868,696,20030,29889,13861,11469,5246,553,3483,952,267,29892,454,1147,8977,316,15243,2362,29892,425,8774,13775,316,269,473,455,1908,3911,7905,22588,29948,443,2656,29892,454,23900,868,2757,29889,6803,1410,4894,29878,425,23251,344,29892,980,21668,17043,13639,7175,3476,15471,425,4439,328,347,428,4555,4875,707,6879,603,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,966,508,22543,29892,274,29915,342,4191,553,724,29878,1295,1671,966,19612,12416,29892,980,21668,11469,425,289,7293,1067,29948,29889,1174,11172,712,5246,21206,326,2488,29892,634,6701,1354,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,316,289,10617,2353,2320,1387,29892,1444,19760,10135,374,7808,5278,1067,29948,29889,1174,5246,29892,980,19947,3420,6311,7732,883,267,316,23900,868,2757,29889,2664,25974,1144,4625,577,647,29948,4239,23068,782,1067,29948,20737,1863,1647,29892,3503,425,22448,29892,302,29915,29874,22572,29915,15669,20480,1540,1067,29948,1750,3911,3928,29889,1704,26744,452,17043,13871,6079,818,425,10375,332,29889,7298,680,29885,358,29892,373,966,758,348,778,344,1597,18062,1209,424,577,262,29892,8532,29892,1671,966,577,647,743,29892,373,3667,895,553,20389,10270,4191,425,521,457,585,1935,2390,347,29889,11948,4875,5246,4439,28661,22527,5644,262,316,1437,29887,30057,1372,29889,8748,29202,29892,4875,302,29915,29874,20480,348,20744,7774,29948,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,3913,777,23023,1848,5929,1338,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29892,1316,408,278,671,310,278,16549,376,433,8774,13775,316,269,473,455,1908,29908,304,8453,278,23900,9101,322,278,1967,310,263,1820,304,1722,278,23900,681,21622,272,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,263,2821,322,752,7807,6555,2643,29892,322,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,526,451,2337,6969,491,10757,470,16667,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,3229,393,376,29876,711,1486,9906,25798,29908,1048,278,4654,883,310,24207,23900,563,837,1475,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,322,3732,1009,2980,3109,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,1123,1658,292,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,6041,17422,8734,470,2729,373,443,771,854,20813,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,5995,393,20389,3145,763,1935,2390,262,29220,27580,508,367,1304,304,577,10323,24207,23900,338,451,6969,491,16021,10757,322,2444,25057,304,367,11828,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,1539,12451,943,322,15690,583,508,367,16051,322,1320,1461,515,1009,1667,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,14335,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,411,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,325,3640,6382,708,29892,278,10225,310,2821,10757,322,16667,24481,3732,278,12032,3109,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":60509666853,"load_duration":182522,"prompt_eval_count":293,"prompt_eval_duration":24616043000,"eval_count":293,"eval_duration":35892766000}
