{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T21:37:04.094925956Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present a rigorous argument. The speaker does an excellent job of establishing a connection with the audience by using relatable examples and metaphors (e.g., \"Le sentiment de sécurité c'est ce sentir à la brie du risque d'un danger imminent\"). They also use clear and concise language to convey their message, making it easy for the audience to follow along.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the speaker could improve:\n\n1. Use of statistics: While the speaker provides some examples of how everyday objects can manipulate sensitive data, they could benefit from providing more concrete statistics or studies to support their claims. This would help to build a stronger argument and increase the speaker's credibility.\n2. Clarity on the main point: At times, it seems that the speaker is discussing multiple topics simultaneously (e.g., the importance of feeling secure, the connection between guarantee and confidence). While these points are related, it would be helpful to have a clearer focus on the main argument being made.\n3. Call to action: The speaker does not provide a clear call to action at the end of their speech, which can make the message feel somewhat incomplete. Providing specific steps that the audience can take to address the issue would help to leave a lasting impression and encourage further action.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,707,29899,346,712,7890,7890,269,2016,29920,427,7019,2764,2131,2123,13911,333,819,2123,6701,22572,29915,15669,1465,5278,269,3498,25235,1190,325,359,521,30000,1960,1577,951,19688,316,7019,2764,2131,274,29915,342,2257,2665,381,818,425,1506,347,868,5161,802,270,29915,348,9703,527,1195,424,29889,1459,17488,29892,1354,7890,1072,19755,29920,2123,316,9460,9014,21017,454,2174,18753,29892,8992,29920,29899,23088,11878,1236,332,439,29915,309,269,29915,4582,27537,280,1190,7890,8997,712,7890,29871,22730,6974,29948,7907,29899,29891,2470,634,1661,634,5278,1970,8837,29892,4875,7890,325,993,427,8691,316,301,29915,1279,4496,29872,634,553,19612,26536,1750,4625,6787,277,2257,21592,2073,29889,8396,29892,274,29915,342,325,17016,29892,7890,452,452,4078,29920,2331,439,29915,2719,3435,3503,7890,4078,29920,712,2257,3435,553,26943,25732,1237,712,6267,18848,263,4370,4313,30069,12898,634,425,992,309,30001,26814,27510,347,712,454,24850,452,2947,2331,7890,6454,495,1190,425,17949,29889,10793,1826,29916,291,2637,27510,347,634,1970,8837,29892,274,29915,342,454,274,16581,316,1601,18848,316,23520,29889,2664,5446,1691,712,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,7890,427,8992,29920,13545,6063,1465,26814,7067,29892,20206,10767,434,29892,13745,6710,634,8164,29899,5474,6701,1067,29948,316,992,17252,2535,2123,1765,2002,5418,29889,323,681,7015,5446,1691,11525,352,296,553,21880,4771,13876,5646,427,1302,7425,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,263,12912,20657,2980,29889,450,25657,947,385,15129,4982,310,10127,292,263,3957,411,278,20026,491,773,1104,17219,6455,322,1539,12451,943,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,3226,19688,316,7019,2764,2131,274,29915,342,2257,2665,381,818,425,1506,347,868,5161,802,270,29915,348,9703,527,1195,296,2564,2688,884,671,2821,322,3022,895,4086,304,27769,1009,2643,29892,3907,372,4780,363,278,20026,304,1101,3412,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,263,2846,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,29901,13,13,29896,29889,4803,310,13964,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,6455,310,920,1432,3250,3618,508,26749,20502,848,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18387,13964,470,11898,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,723,1371,304,2048,263,23505,2980,322,7910,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,29889,13,29906,29889,15183,537,373,278,1667,1298,29901,2180,3064,29892,372,2444,393,278,25657,338,5353,292,2999,23820,21699,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,278,13500,310,11223,11592,29892,278,3957,1546,18818,322,16420,467,5806,1438,3291,526,4475,29892,372,723,367,8444,304,505,263,26135,8569,373,278,1667,2980,1641,1754,29889,13,29941,29889,8251,304,3158,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,1246,304,3158,472,278,1095,310,1009,12032,29892,607,508,1207,278,2643,4459,10579,28907,29889,9133,4821,2702,6576,393,278,20026,508,2125,304,3211,278,2228,723,1371,304,5967,263,1833,292,17188,322,13731,6617,4340,3158,29889],"total_duration":62120766641,"load_duration":186459,"prompt_eval_count":282,"prompt_eval_duration":23590809000,"eval_count":314,"eval_duration":38529343000}
