{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T21:31:39.614789591Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of clear argumentation: The speaker often uses vague language or makes general statements without providing clear evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims. For example, they say \"On en a gros depuis depuis de 60 ans les pesticides utilisés dans le monde entier,\" but they don't provide any data or research to back up this claim.\n2. Overreliance on emotional appeals: The speaker relies heavily on emotional appeals, such as the use of the word \"sexy\" and the threat of harming non-human living things. While these tactics may be effective in persuading some audiences, they don't necessarily contribute to a rigorous or convincing argument.\n3. Inconsistent messaging: The speaker seems to contradict themselves at times, using terms like \"pesticides\" and \"fitos sanitaire\" interchangeably, despite the fact that these terms have different connotations and implications. This inconsistency undermines their credibility and makes it harder to follow their argument.\n4. Lack of attention to detail: The speaker makes a few factual errors, such as referring to \"le traité au kill max\" when they likely mean \"the pesticide treatment.\" These mistakes suggest that the speaker may not have put sufficient effort into researching and preparing their speech.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's message may be well-intentioned, the lack of clear argumentation, emotional appeals, inconsistent messaging, and factual errors make it difficult to evaluate the persuasiveness and rigor of their reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,29899,309,29892,373,427,263,26379,8997,8997,316,29871,29953,29900,6063,966,282,15931,2247,22700,743,1465,454,9122,875,631,29892,1671,301,29915,29882,352,271,1908,29892,301,29915,1466,634,301,29915,14531,29889,4546,29875,8532,19601,1465,1601,2432,9874,270,29915,4422,4637,10812,358,454,20689,282,15931,2247,2123,634,274,29915,342,1597,22577,378,16666,302,2445,1230,29889,838,943,373,610,25931,28185,9373,316,1391,1169,29892,6216,359,9753,9407,2123,6216,359,1374,22824,346,329,3783,29889,26219,2123,29875,29892,2257,712,432,29915,1794,12242,562,29948,409,3594,29892,1354,1444,7890,766,712,1444,325,1759,274,351,324,261,325,359,5697,3246,11343,1041,29892,712,1444,325,1759,966,289,1883,643,1465,454,4771,316,425,20491,634,6267,10019,1524,14984,966,3984,5908,712,452,301,29915,6727,5793,818,11449,1671,8532,9073,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,1354,1444,7890,766,1759,29892,13386,29887,3543,29892,13386,521,273,29892,18916,29892,454,1020,2131,782,12088,4236,29892,454,4236,29892,274,29915,342,2428,6366,815,29892,20554,3435,14984,13162,23855,882,4224,2487,743,29889,8748,1671,29873,424,29892,274,29915,342,6079,443,14857,26742,2445,347,1462,5632,29948,966,1136,3011,14075,1661,29899,16063,2708,1671,5256,7608,966,19643,1860,316,7814,4185,1973,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,966,6062,29948,21337,22700,2406,3435,22458,5475,634,868,521,14623,2131,325,609,19397,269,29915,264,280,369,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,2980,362,29901,450,25657,4049,3913,25160,4086,470,3732,2498,9506,1728,13138,2821,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1827,376,2951,427,263,26379,8997,8997,316,29871,29953,29900,6063,966,282,15931,2247,22700,743,1465,454,9122,875,631,1699,541,896,1016,29915,29873,3867,738,848,470,5925,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,13,29906,29889,6811,276,13036,373,23023,1848,5929,1338,29901,450,25657,337,3687,20365,373,23023,1848,5929,1338,29892,1316,408,278,671,310,278,1734,376,344,3594,29908,322,278,28469,310,10311,292,1661,29899,26029,8471,2712,29889,5806,1438,28476,1199,1122,367,11828,297,20408,9382,777,12990,819,778,29892,896,1016,29915,29873,12695,29126,304,263,12912,20657,470,17953,3277,2980,29889,13,29941,29889,512,3200,9696,4473,6751,29901,450,25657,2444,304,27877,6053,472,3064,29892,773,4958,763,376,29886,15931,2247,29908,322,376,9202,359,9753,9407,29908,1006,3167,2197,29892,15020,278,2114,393,1438,4958,505,1422,378,1333,800,322,2411,5795,29889,910,22435,391,3819,563,837,1475,1009,6625,4127,322,3732,372,22622,304,1101,1009,2980,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,8570,304,9493,29901,450,25657,3732,263,2846,2114,950,4436,29892,1316,408,16811,304,376,280,1020,2131,782,12088,4236,29908,746,896,5517,2099,376,1552,282,15931,680,14502,1213,4525,28947,4368,393,278,25657,1122,451,505,1925,8002,7225,964,5925,292,322,10223,292,1009,12032,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,1122,367,1532,29899,524,2509,287,29892,278,10225,310,2821,2980,362,29892,23023,1848,5929,1338,29892,22435,9696,4473,6751,29892,322,2114,950,4436,1207,372,5189,304,14707,278,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,1009,24481,29889],"total_duration":72273002035,"load_duration":262360,"prompt_eval_count":290,"prompt_eval_duration":24353450000,"eval_count":384,"eval_duration":47916643000}
