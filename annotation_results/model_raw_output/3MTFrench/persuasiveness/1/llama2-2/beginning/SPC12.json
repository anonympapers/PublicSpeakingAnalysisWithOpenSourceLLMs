{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T23:26:32.793190677Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would score the speech as a 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker is able to effectively convey their message and use examples to support their argument. However, there are some areas where the speech could be improved upon.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more contextual information about the purpose of their thesis and how it will benefit the medical field. While they mention that their goal is to reconstruct patients' medical histories, they do not explain how this will help improve patient care or why it is important. Providing more background information on the topic would have helped to build a stronger argument.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have provided more details about the data they are working with and how they are analyzing it. While they mention that they have access to 20 years of medical information, they do not explain how they are organizing or analyzing this data. Providing more technical details would have helped to establish their credibility and showcase their expertise in the field.\n\nLastly, the speaker could have concluded their speech with a clearer call-to-action. While they mention that their work is important for the future of medicine, they do not provide any specific recommendations or actions that listeners can take to support their cause. Ending the speech with a clear call-to-action would have left a lasting impression on the audience and encouraged them to take action.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speaker could improve upon, they are able to effectively convey their message and use examples to support their argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,11797,5697,1169,3435,270,29915,1175,29915,17073,267,29889,2661,29899,346,712,7890,282,6223,29920,26610,425,1667,1354,7890,8992,29920,20737,27883,443,25974,262,1577,478,681,452,4078,29920,8164,29899,5474,2331,29892,3503,818,2257,3256,29899,27048,29892,11797,4625,19694,443,13659,10283,936,1190,7890,29889,8748,1601,18848,1136,2488,818,1841,5231,29539,7015,19313,1671,13304,782,6628,1314,454,3105,332,1020,17334,4555,7890,7890,1841,18809,424,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,25974,457,15001,5711,1318,29889,1720,6025,344,25915,29892,1601,1203,361,316,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,17789,582,533,26814,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,461,1444,286,29915,29891,544,1975,1577,9353,301,29915,29882,30069,29886,2410,6722,1444,6427,8284,29892,8556,1029,787,544,29145,316,325,19680,6063,270,29915,19678,10283,28148,10961,29948,4555,544,29145,316,29871,29896,29900,14746,316,13659,29879,10283,293,2993,29892,9953,743,2535,19601,1465,454,2432,9874,868,4802,848,29889,6803,16455,643,7015,21880,29892,1444,966,1933,895,427,316,13830,5216,7545,29892,966,21880,2281,332,2406,634,966,21880,1661,2281,332,2406,29889,6803,966,21880,2281,332,2406,29892,2257,3435,553,19313,1027,2701,29892,13547,712,454,2245,868,10283,936,286,29915,331,558,275,2123,966,1801,1691,1473,7147,18475,296,993,610,454,16500,29889,12390,19313,3435,2258,21873,818,16455,643,1559,20554,3435,10961,2406,1465,427,1591,585,29889,853,337,3703,1173,1671,966,21880,1661,2281,332,2406,409,3435,966,13659,29879,10283,293,2993,29889,8748,274,29915,342,301,29915,627,29872,2123,2257,752,492,17851,29889,12660,16627,980,343,263,10741,4072,316,13659,29879,553,1235,5888,29892,553,4313,392,375,316,521,6349,1295,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,263,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,27769,1009,2643,322,671,6455,304,2304,1009,2980,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,2501,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,950,2472,1048,278,6437,310,1009,266,6656,322,920,372,674,14169,278,16083,1746,29889,5806,896,3585,393,1009,7306,338,304,337,11433,22069,29915,16083,3603,583,29892,896,437,451,5649,920,445,674,1371,11157,16500,2562,470,2020,372,338,4100,29889,9133,4821,901,3239,2472,373,278,11261,723,505,9213,304,2048,263,23505,2980,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,4902,1048,278,848,896,526,1985,411,322,920,896,526,29537,292,372,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,505,2130,304,29871,29906,29900,2440,310,16083,2472,29892,896,437,451,5649,920,896,526,2894,5281,470,29537,292,445,848,29889,9133,4821,901,16905,4902,723,505,9213,304,10127,1009,6625,4127,322,1510,4878,1009,17924,895,297,278,1746,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,22834,1009,12032,411,263,26135,1246,29899,517,29899,2467,29889,5806,896,3585,393,1009,664,338,4100,363,278,5434,310,26602,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6907,800,470,8820,393,11621,414,508,2125,304,2304,1009,4556,29889,2796,292,278,12032,411,263,2821,1246,29899,517,29899,2467,723,505,2175,263,1833,292,17188,373,278,20026,322,18443,287,963,304,2125,3158,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,2501,29892,896,526,2221,304,17583,27769,1009,2643,322,671,6455,304,2304,1009,2980,29889],"total_duration":71152571921,"load_duration":190011,"prompt_eval_count":341,"prompt_eval_duration":28676928000,"eval_count":343,"eval_duration":42474932000}
