The speaker presents some valid points about the impact of climate change on agriculture and food security, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's assertion that \"on est en plein dedans\" (we are right in the middle of it) without providing any evidence or context to support this claim is a bit vague. It would have been more convincing if they had provided specific data or studies to back up their claim.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's argument that \"on a toujours vu des conséquences du change climatique\" (we have always seen the consequences of climate change) without acknowledging the severity and complexity of the issue is somewhat oversimplified. While it is true that some regions have experienced milder effects of climate change, other areas have been severely impacted, such as increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and altered ecosystems. A more nuanced approach to the topic would have acknowledged these variations and their implications.\n\nThirdly, the speaker's suggestion that \"on peut choisir quoi cultiver et trouver des variétés qui s'adaptent aux nouveaux environnements\" (we can choose what to cultivate and find new varieties that adapt to the new environments) oversimplifies the issue of crop adaptation. While it is true that farmers can adopt new agricultural practices and crops that are better suited to changing environmental conditions, this does not address the larger issue of climate change itself. A more comprehensive approach would have acknowledged the need for systemic changes in agriculture and food production to address the root causes of climate change.\n\nLastly, the speaker's use of a simple example of growing wheat without providing any context or nuance to support their argument is somewhat lacking. While wheat is an important crop, it is not the only one that is affected by climate change, and there are many other factors that can impact its cultivation. A more comprehensive analysis would have taken into account the various crops that are impacted by climate change and the need for a diverse range of agricultural practices to address these challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, while the speaker raises some valid points about the impact of climate change on agriculture and food security, their reasoning could be more rigorous and comprehensive to fully convince the audience of the urgency of this issue.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,1735,10784,15819,29892,29871,4277,7890,610,280,29892,10814,289,801,29892,373,707,427,5644,262,28262,550,29889,29871,30219,29874,2947,1634,5761,297,5903,8270,358,24145,2258,15529,316,9364,276,634,427,28353,316,2257,302,29915,6272,533,29889,1551,263,9411,20737,18679,553,1136,21871,2063,868,1735,10784,15819,29892,553,1374,1690,290,22702,1841,21962,1237,634,5537,1237,4191,553,5694,22730,2123,553,7019,305,1253,267,29889,2664,9744,1179,9221,5283,267,1874,296,297,735,272,519,358,29889,6803,7814,21181,818,364,4600,29892,373,302,29915,29874,18413,4370,5695,20081,1190,18249,634,425,4665,14475,6773,270,29915,2987,358,261,29889,319,7890,29899,29873,29899,1808,29892,274,29915,342,1597,297,2445,284,2131,270,29915,5753,2093,3479,18475,2863,20196,7147,634,7890,8992,29920,1597,6434,6896,283,19505,427,6063,1577,838,943,439,7768,29892,1444,592,652,23469,7890,1577,838,943,373,16374,269,29915,21412,29889,1551,8164,3060,275,381,439,7768,4185,2147,634,534,8885,553,1197,7719,1750,269,29915,328,481,296,25235,10984,2993,12471,17239,5646,427,378,2974,443,10814,364,13469,358,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,1597,2284,9874,5516,344,316,2646,262,610,611,13639,1559,5606,29889,349,1267,787,316,1999,29948,610,17488,29889,438,1481,29892,432,29915,1794,6079,3710,492,29948,29889,1174,28353,29892,454,1999,29948,260,9030,29889,15076,2663,610,346,712,274,29915,342,425,269,4894,1808,425,2298,18834,1318,634,425,2298,1136,3011,1318,1465,454,9122,29889,8748,443,18480,316,1999,29948,1436,6311,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,20408,294,573,2643,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,10879,310,23622,1735,373,18032,545,322,9687,6993,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,376,265,707,427,5644,262,28262,550,29908,313,705,526,1492,297,278,7256,310,372,29897,1728,13138,738,10757,470,3030,304,2304,445,5995,338,263,2586,25160,29889,739,723,505,1063,901,17953,3277,565,896,750,4944,2702,848,470,11898,304,1250,701,1009,5995,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,376,265,263,15237,18679,553,1136,21871,2063,868,1735,10784,15819,29908,313,705,505,2337,3595,278,27721,310,23622,1735,29897,1728,24084,3460,278,2775,537,322,13644,310,278,2228,338,10579,288,874,13699,2164,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,777,12786,505,18860,2316,672,9545,310,23622,1735,29892,916,10161,505,1063,2775,873,10879,287,29892,1316,408,11664,10868,322,2775,537,310,18677,14826,4959,29892,20493,7205,11174,29892,322,10551,287,321,3944,973,29879,29889,319,901,4948,8362,2948,304,278,11261,723,505,24084,3192,1438,21833,322,1009,2411,5795,29889,13,13,1349,1823,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,8998,393,376,265,8164,3060,275,381,439,7768,4185,2147,634,534,8885,553,1197,28141,1750,269,29915,1114,415,296,3479,10984,2993,12471,29876,4110,29908,313,705,508,6755,825,304,18834,403,322,1284,716,1197,20850,393,7744,304,278,716,23136,29897,288,874,13699,11057,278,2228,310,274,1336,28206,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,2215,13269,508,9332,716,18032,3631,23274,322,8182,567,393,526,2253,480,1573,304,6480,29380,5855,29892,445,947,451,3211,278,7200,2228,310,23622,1735,3528,29889,319,901,15171,6270,2948,723,505,24084,3192,278,817,363,1788,293,3620,297,18032,545,322,9687,5802,304,3211,278,3876,9946,310,23622,1735,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,263,2560,1342,310,15678,21266,271,1728,13138,738,3030,470,4948,749,304,2304,1009,2980,338,10579,10225,292,29889,5806,21266,271,338,385,4100,274,1336,29892,372,338,451,278,871,697,393,338,15201,491,23622,1735,29892,322,727,526,1784,916,13879,393,508,10879,967,18834,362,29889,319,901,15171,6270,7418,723,505,4586,964,3633,278,5164,8182,567,393,526,10879,287,491,23622,1735,322,278,817,363,263,16984,3464,310,18032,3631,23274,304,3211,1438,18066,267,29889,13,13,797,15997,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,278,10879,310,23622,1735,373,18032,545,322,9687,6993,29892,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,15171,6270,304,8072,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,5065
