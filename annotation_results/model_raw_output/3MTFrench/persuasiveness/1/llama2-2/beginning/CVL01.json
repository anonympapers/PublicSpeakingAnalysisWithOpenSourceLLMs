The speaker effectively uses gestures to help the audience understand their message, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by asking a simple question and then repeats it using a gesture, which helps to emphasize their point. However, the argument is not particularly original or insightful, and the speaker does not provide any concrete evidence to support their claim that gestures are an effective teaching tool. Additionally, the speaker's use of language could be more varied and sophisticated, which would help to make their argument more convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker makes some valid points about the importance of gestures in communication, their argument could benefit from more depth and rigor.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,997,5582,29920,29899,4346,29875,7890,926,261,1597,25642,634,2560,1139,29889,4309,275,302,2231,29899,29890,3498,818,2298,302,4070,585,3503,1597,521,747,283,29889,838,943,29892,10814,29892,1444,25179,12973,29892,24228,302,2231,29899,29890,3498,425,7446,280,302,2231,29899,585,3503,6722,302,2231,29899,455,29899,29890,283,263,29892,274,29915,342,29899,346,712,4191,29871,4277,1661,1577,365,30001,29892,432,29915,1794,28643,1597,7737,13498,1750,7890,263,3635,275,316,6628,1314,7199,9030,2257,712,1444,766,1759,29889,8748,274,29915,342,7737,13498,29892,274,29915,342,425,25407,553,1804,267,634,274,29915,342,18916,454,29140,316,611,266,17449,29889,4526,8356,712,425,25407,553,1804,267,707,443,714,309,282,2487,13247,1387,427,17792,29889,6340,2947,19172,276,427,20744,270,29915,29948,793,261,301,15792,29892,875,5818,29892,818,6628,1314,623,5606,29882,1581,966,623,7771,790,1179,634,818,6628,1314,7199,9030,2257,712,6309,301,4564,29948,647,424,29889,1174,20744,29892,316,25226,22299,4625,1601,509,29948,712,425,7737,13498,14924,4904,270,29915,5753,29948,672,782,4771,868,2313,2470,29889,997,25407,553,1804,267,707,427,260,1540,316,301,29915,996,351,2445,29948,346,2491,29892,1354,443,23930,647,424,4365,484,427,6701,8714,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,7737,1973,304,1371,278,20026,2274,1009,2643,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,6721,263,2560,1139,322,769,5565,1446,372,773,263,29502,29892,607,6911,304,19310,675,1009,1298,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,338,451,10734,2441,470,25483,1319,29892,322,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,7737,1973,526,385,11828,18819,5780,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,1033,367,901,23821,322,269,3021,4695,630,29892,607,723,1371,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3732,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,7737,1973,297,12084,29892,1009,2980,1033,14169,515,901,10809,322,12912,272,29889],"total_duration":45802798778,"load_duration":258804,"prompt_eval_count":256,"prompt_eval_duration":23434559000,"eval_count":178,"eval_duration":22367502000}
