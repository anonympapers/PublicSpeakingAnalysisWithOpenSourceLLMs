The speaker does not provide rigorous reasoning or strong evidence to support their claims, and the message is not particularly convincing.\n\nThe speaker does not offer any original insights or perspectives on the topic, and their argument relies heavily on generalizations and vague statements. For example, they claim that the industry is \"terrible\" without providing any specific examples or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, their call to action is unspecific and lacks urgency, with no clear recommendations for how to address the problems they identify.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's passion and enthusiasm are evident in their delivery, their message falls short of being persuasive due to a lack of rigorous reasoning and evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,1671,7890,1518,492,7808,454,29140,316,611,266,17449,29892,1444,325,1759,7890,1153,535,357,301,29915,13624,13568,579,1387,1465,22922,6397,12836,29889,1954,351,4983,425,752,357,29892,7209,7209,29899,264,7907,425,22104,316,301,29915,273,327,29889,28266,29892,2257,22922,263,25456,425,1841,4068,6397,12836,29892,634,16134,424,29892,966,5189,743,316,301,29915,20041,2546,29889,8748,274,29915,342,9577,25698,2249,15819,610,346,712,925,882,29892,425,752,357,707,1437,14081,1647,316,301,29915,20041,2546,29889,6803,7848,2298,16784,895,29892,425,752,357,707,1044,27751,8022,1318,610,301,29915,20041,2546,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,634,269,29915,27601,434,301,29915,342,3780,634,10484,5606,2637,966,1667,29879,868,2320,275,819,29892,838,29920,27400,634,868,10684,19507,14090,29889,897,2257,455,29892,274,29915,342,6628,1314,28185,9373,26842,404,29948,610,270,29915,14559,6367,1080,29889,6298,5646,712,454,21149,5411,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,263,6079,1874,29948,634,712,425,3022,26841,707,21617,29884,16403,29889,951,3669,455,29892,274,29915,342,712,7015,5189,743,17424,28065,296,12563,1597,10375,270,29915,14559,25698,19503,29889,2726,2320,275,819,1750,760,296,29892,553,13137,11369,16895,267,29892,2298,818,425,1436,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,12912,20657,24481,470,4549,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,322,278,2643,338,451,10734,17953,3277,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,451,5957,738,2441,1663,5861,470,3736,1103,3145,373,278,11261,29892,322,1009,2980,337,3687,20365,373,2498,17063,322,25160,9506,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,278,13661,338,376,357,11710,29908,1728,13138,738,2702,6455,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,1009,1246,304,3158,338,443,14940,322,425,4684,5065,14703,29892,411,694,2821,6907,800,363,920,304,3211,278,4828,896,12439,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,23644,3173,29885,526,13602,297,1009,28289,29892,1009,2643,20074,3273,310,1641,20408,294,573,2861,304,263,10225,310,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29889],"total_duration":56162544563,"load_duration":211137,"prompt_eval_count":258,"prompt_eval_duration":29697121000,"eval_count":183,"eval_duration":26464565000}
