The speaker provides some interesting historical context and analysis of the Russian market, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker makes some generalizations about the Russian market without providing enough evidence to support their claims. For example, they state that RONO has been present in Russia for over 100 years and has a winning strategy, but do not provide any data or examples to back up these claims. This lack of concrete evidence makes it difficult to evaluate the speaker's argument.\n\nSecondly, the speaker jumps quickly from discussing the history of RONO to analyzing their commercial strategies without providing enough context or explanation. This makes it hard to follow their train of thought and understand how they arrived at their conclusions.\n\nLastly, the speaker's use of acronyms such as \"RONO\" and \"LONO\" without properly defining them creates confusion for the listener. It would be helpful if the speaker provided more context or explanation for these terms to ensure that the listener is able to understand their significance.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the Russian market, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,1354,1444,325,1759,610,1358,316,425,4719,347,29892,1634,25594,818,439,7768,1577,2726,14333,1041,29892,1444,301,29915,1794,553,288,943,29892,553,527,11259,5884,22297,29889,8396,29892,634,1671,2257,9744,18916,29892,7890,992,4099,29920,7594,992,17252,1577,997,7890,5161,802,270,29915,5474,11468,275,29889,6101,1444,7890,766,390,1164,29949,29892,2123,29875,2123,29875,390,1164,29949,29892,373,610,280,2331,270,29915,6430,1893,3246,390,1164,29949,29892,634,373,263,270,29915,5753,536,29892,3503,14034,29920,29899,23088,712,390,1164,29949,707,16474,427,1162,333,8997,2298,316,1644,6063,29889,6340,4313,12161,425,2298,6815,2723,275,457,782,29899,1356,12213,316,425,4719,347,29889,6803,443,564,9318,18916,29892,373,263,443,16151,269,30095,29878,20480,1540,1034,18953,29889,16932,4625,3984,443,2058,1597,26742,2445,347,29889,16932,4625,3984,443,2058,1597,26742,2445,347,330,4211,1647,29889,6803,425,7199,9030,1671,425,10252,276,29892,980,21668,7848,818,425,10098,3603,819,634,23837,2488,29889,8748,29871,4277,274,29915,342,1601,11510,631,29889,1174,4242,29875,29899,27048,29892,966,17124,6609,29892,966,8774,386,2631,316,18848,634,3603,819,634,23837,2488,29892,432,29915,24209,344,966,26742,2445,583,12128,267,634,10713,904,324,17925,1465,454,8714,29889,422,1004,1354,274,29915,342,454,3209,316,365,1164,29949,29892,4191,1354,274,29915,342,454,3209,316,390,1164,29949,29892,11797,3435,6003,375,427,4719,347,782,13222,316,29871,29906,29955,6476,7799,29889,16932,3435,316,534,8885,634,325,609,10252,276,553,289,2925,26742,2445,583,1671,1841,1558,381,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,15839,3030,322,7418,310,278,10637,9999,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,3732,777,2498,17063,1048,278,10637,9999,1728,13138,3307,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,2106,393,390,1164,29949,756,1063,2198,297,12710,363,975,29871,29896,29900,29900,2440,322,756,263,15613,13705,29892,541,437,451,3867,738,848,470,6455,304,1250,701,1438,16726,29889,910,10225,310,18387,10757,3732,372,5189,304,14707,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,432,17204,9098,515,5353,292,278,4955,310,390,1164,29949,304,29537,292,1009,12128,16650,583,1728,13138,3307,3030,470,8252,29889,910,3732,372,2898,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,322,2274,920,896,11977,472,1009,21204,1080,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,1274,1617,962,29879,1316,408,376,29934,1164,29949,29908,322,376,29931,1164,29949,29908,1728,6284,16184,963,10017,14679,363,278,13254,29889,739,723,367,8444,565,278,25657,4944,901,3030,470,8252,363,1438,4958,304,9801,393,278,13254,338,2221,304,2274,1009,26002,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,10637,9999,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":64871514613,"load_duration":283911,"prompt_eval_count":319,"prompt_eval_duration":27049165000,"eval_count":298,"eval_duration":37821476000}
