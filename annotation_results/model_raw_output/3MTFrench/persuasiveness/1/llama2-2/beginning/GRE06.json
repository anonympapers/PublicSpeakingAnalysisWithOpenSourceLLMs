{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T11:56:11.343871913Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some interesting and thought-provoking ideas about gravity and quantum mechanics, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that \"l'armasse courbe l'espace et le temps\" is not supported by any scientific evidence or explanations. It is simply stated as a fact without any further elaboration or justification. To make their argument more persuasive, they could have provided some theoretical frameworks or examples to illustrate how gravity warps space and time.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's analogy of grandmother going near a black hole is intriguing, but it is not clear how it relates to the concept of quantum superposition. They could have explained this idea more clearly and provided some examples or analogies to help the audience better understand it.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas, their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported by scientific evidence. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects the speaker's effort to present their ideas in an engaging and entertaining manner, but with room for improvement in terms of substance and rigor.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8407,29871,29906,29900,5000,8115,29892,2694,5465,544,2487,277,301,29915,735,11416,553,534,348,6390,29879,29889,7747,3435,553,5446,1691,1354,11071,267,712,5646,2257,1750,6454,2291,301,29915,524,14508,302,29915,264,18475,3890,818,4883,29889,365,29915,2817,5793,2085,915,301,29915,267,3535,634,454,8714,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,439,29915,30001,23203,2131,29892,454,8714,2947,269,29915,4582,283,1358,2298,301,296,882,29889,6101,610,17488,26814,4595,29899,29885,1908,2947,818,21384,270,29915,348,534,348,6390,29889,6803,4875,29892,980,269,29915,4582,283,25931,13545,1473,267,13180,712,1671,7890,29892,1190,18249,29892,980,269,29915,4582,283,25931,553,8595,29889,23719,1039,29892,7628,339,29915,1808,337,1403,25404,29892,7890,1671,2546,29920,7848,2298,19406,29887,21871,1379,29889,315,29915,342,2257,712,8556,623,29878,1975,425,8310,2131,29889,4241,841,424,29892,1444,325,1759,7890,610,1358,316,425,8774,3068,1387,4323,1387,29892,1750,4224,1377,454,20299,882,782,17887,5418,29889,2664,12301,267,29892,966,16530,690,29889,10793,13219,7661,707,13162,23855,882,270,292,434,29889,6101,432,29915,28899,275,4323,1387,29892,1444,1671,23469,7848,29871,1654,29889,8748,18916,29892,782,6701,3256,29892,1354,432,29915,28899,275,4323,1387,29892,28194,1444,1209,1572,29875,1597,14931,29892,1444,286,3610,927,432,29915,3055,29875,29889,10311,265,895,29991,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,322,2714,29899,16123,17223,7014,1048,20953,322,12101,7208,1199,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,376,29880,29915,2817,5793,2085,915,301,29915,267,3535,634,454,8714,29908,338,451,6969,491,738,16021,10757,470,7309,800,29889,739,338,3763,8703,408,263,2114,1728,738,4340,13771,362,470,925,2450,29889,1763,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29892,896,1033,505,4944,777,23399,29143,470,6455,304,28475,920,20953,1370,567,2913,322,931,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,3483,6933,310,4595,29885,1228,2675,2978,263,4628,16188,338,11158,5526,292,29892,541,372,338,451,2821,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,6964,310,12101,2428,3283,29889,2688,1033,505,10824,445,2969,901,9436,322,4944,777,6455,470,15690,583,304,1371,278,20026,2253,2274,372,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,29892,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,491,16021,10757,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,278,25657,29915,29879,7225,304,2198,1009,7014,297,385,3033,6751,322,22684,292,8214,29892,541,411,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,5960,749,322,12912,272,29889],"total_duration":114170929897,"load_duration":340411,"prompt_eval_count":274,"prompt_eval_duration":24865866000,"eval_count":280,"eval_duration":89304138000}
