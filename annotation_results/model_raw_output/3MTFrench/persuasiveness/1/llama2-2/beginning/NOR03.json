{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T00:56:13.256193351Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker is not very effective in crafting a convincing message and their reasoning is not rigorous. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of clear argumentation: The speaker jumps quickly from one topic to another without providing clear connections or logical reasoning between them. For example, they mention the war in the sea, then switch to talking about spies and James Bond, and finally end up discussing the vulnerability of young ossetes. It's difficult to follow their line of thinking or understand their main argument.\n2. Unclear language: The speaker uses some technical terms like \"crabeur\" and \"esp√®ces\" without properly defining them, making it hard for the listener to understand what they are talking about. Additionally, some of their sentences are unclear or grammatically incorrect, which can make it difficult to follow their train of thought.\n3. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes claims about the ossetes being particularly vulnerable to predators without providing any evidence or context to support these claims. This lack of evidence makes it difficult to evaluate the validity of their argument.\n4. Unconvincing examples: The speaker uses the example of James Bond to illustrate their point, but this example is not relevant to the topic at hand and doesn't provide a clear analogy for the listener to understand.\n\nOverall, the speaker's lack of clear argumentation, unclear language, and failure to provide evidence make their speech less persuasive and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,872,275,2331,1354,7890,29871,22730,782,2085,424,3503,1465,425,2778,29892,274,29915,342,425,12573,29889,838,943,4191,1465,14984,966,6109,690,29892,980,343,263,553,8116,2719,634,553,8774,305,1934,29889,1174,4951,29871,4277,1437,14081,316,1601,409,2058,29889,11948,14255,19601,966,8774,305,1934,409,3435,553,7175,1256,1295,634,966,8116,2719,634,966,410,335,1372,29889,8748,1465,425,2778,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,316,534,20372,3479,270,7844,29899,29883,30106,1295,29889,1720,343,263,28185,9373,553,394,267,29892,553,696,305,1691,634,868,899,29889,1632,20032,3479,339,1379,373,8164,409,3949,283,29888,1358,29889,8748,270,29915,8284,1295,1465,425,2778,29892,274,29915,342,2257,712,28185,9373,425,12573,14671,680,29889,26383,553,260,294,270,29915,9983,1080,1750,452,325,2736,336,993,2331,409,9073,553,5516,7808,610,1236,332,316,409,8689,286,4600,29889,4546,29875,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,4239,22609,868,439,29915,342,1601,1652,482,29889,997,7019,1173,707,454,12220,915,332,29889,997,7019,1173,1671,7890,2990,261,29892,274,29915,342,1597,274,681,457,316,425,282,1173,332,634,868,1208,655,29889,6340,8164,521,283,1358,1465,301,29915,9983,10491,316,301,29915,465,882,29889,12603,724,294,443,7006,454,13164,316,5011,26370,29889,951,12220,915,332,3911,29892,980,521,283,1358,29892,3503,712,18097,980,707,17222,29892,7847,274,29915,342,2331,610,29888,1249,29892,28185,9373,1465,301,29915,9983,10491,316,301,29915,19898,29889,7747,16933,443,7006,454,13164,454,302,9095,2897,842,29871,29896,29955,29889,12390,12950,267,5152,17893,4625,301,29915,1466,16391,1190,7814,11561,270,29915,348,9619,296,4323,1379,3435,29026,29889,8748,18097,20554,3435,29026,20554,3435,16530,20564,12799,5483,4201,793,782,7175,1256,332,29889,315,29915,342,1671,29871,4277,439,29915,309,21668,439,29915,1808,409,7090,29892,1444,592,26099,15390,29889,2581,7890,610,11818,316,425,12573,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,338,451,1407,11828,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,322,1009,24481,338,451,12912,20657,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,2980,362,29901,450,25657,432,17204,9098,515,697,11261,304,1790,1728,13138,2821,12368,470,16667,24481,1546,963,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,278,1370,297,278,7205,29892,769,4607,304,9963,1048,805,583,322,5011,26370,29892,322,7146,1095,701,5353,292,278,23180,3097,310,4123,2897,842,267,29889,739,29915,29879,5189,304,1101,1009,1196,310,7291,470,2274,1009,1667,2980,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,4086,29901,450,25657,3913,777,16905,4958,763,376,26844,915,332,29908,322,376,9983,17893,29908,1728,6284,16184,963,29892,3907,372,2898,363,278,13254,304,2274,825,896,526,9963,1048,29889,19814,29892,777,310,1009,25260,526,20871,470,14961,20300,10240,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,16726,1048,278,2897,842,267,1641,10734,23180,519,304,4450,4097,1728,13138,738,10757,470,3030,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,910,10225,310,10757,3732,372,5189,304,14707,278,2854,537,310,1009,2980,29889,13,29946,29889,853,535,3845,3277,6455,29901,450,25657,3913,278,1342,310,5011,26370,304,28475,1009,1298,29892,541,445,1342,338,451,8018,304,278,11261,472,1361,322,1838,29915,29873,3867,263,2821,3483,6933,363,278,13254,304,2274,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,10225,310,2821,2980,362,29892,20871,4086,29892,322,10672,304,3867,10757,1207,1009,12032,3109,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":75132073440,"load_duration":266446,"prompt_eval_count":387,"prompt_eval_duration":32964825000,"eval_count":341,"eval_duration":42166488000}
