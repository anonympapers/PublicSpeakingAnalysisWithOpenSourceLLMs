{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T04:44:27.241158533Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 on the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does an effective job of crafting a convincing message and presenting their arguments in a clear and logical manner. They provide specific examples and quotes from comic books to support their thesis, which adds to the persuasive nature of their argument. However, there are some areas where the speaker could improve, such as providing more detailed evidence or counterarguments to strengthen their position.\n\nIn terms of the dimension of \"rigorous reasoning,\" I would give a score of 3 out of 5. While the speaker provides some interesting insights and analysis of superheroes and their impact on culture, there are some instances where their reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, they make a claim that superheroes have become a symbol of hope and inspiration for many people, but they do not provide any empirical evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker could benefit from engaging with opposing viewpoints or counterarguments to further strengthen their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does an effective job of presenting their thesis, there are areas where they could improve the persuasiveness and rigor of their reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,751,392,432,29915,28899,275,12377,424,29892,1444,364,30037,1564,275,270,29915,5474,1597,13159,22673,19006,29889,435,29915,879,275,7005,18097,432,29915,1794,18679,454,2706,1706,333,3504,316,3685,390,326,347,29892,634,432,29915,1794,4370,2600,898,15471,1766,17851,610,425,274,7018,316,1472,1041,9388,13116,29892,443,4595,19397,29892,443,274,506,316,6815,5544,4427,2131,29889,838,943,29892,1444,592,26099,6309,712,1354,425,23520,16253,2131,316,425,15935,29892,14344,29899,455,6303,5246,1671,19601,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,15237,8829,347,316,2970,427,3657,1308,553,419,1199,29889,10050,3503,274,29915,342,1671,454,18848,29889,7747,1750,286,29915,29874,17385,29948,29892,274,29915,342,2257,19688,1750,7890,3581,412,454,3669,600,280,18097,7890,992,4099,29920,443,13159,22673,337,15470,1190,478,3610,8315,29889,365,29915,13624,553,2428,29948,1883,263,844,3977,29948,427,29871,29896,29929,29941,29947,29889,26079,29026,7171,30019,787,409,409,904,5156,509,29948,13048,610,553,12278,787,29889,435,2878,283,2443,332,634,23052,15861,1297,29892,2257,3435,23778,1750,4625,9484,29948,5670,1171,29889,8748,274,29915,342,4191,29871,4277,1750,734,409,3435,270,574,21017,18916,29899,6500,29889,16932,4625,9484,29948,443,5016,833,280,1750,263,1601,16933,29892,5646,2257,1750,3516,25404,610,425,9460,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,1444,592,18593,425,1139,27046,29889,751,1808,707,301,29915,6574,627,634,301,29915,5215,749,553,2428,29948,1883,1465,24145,9257,22572,29915,15669,29889,315,3100,286,29915,29874,28332,29948,818,443,15115,10505,283,275,424,29871,29896,29947,18554,1190,2257,29140,29889,435,29915,1794,5695,301,29915,562,305,749,316,4325,9996,261,553,1804,14075,29892,553,10359,690,29892,553,885,1690,279,9230,29892,553,7840,29948,579,267,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,292,1009,6273,297,263,2821,322,16667,8214,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,322,11839,515,419,293,8277,304,2304,1009,266,6656,29892,607,12778,304,278,20408,294,573,5469,310,1009,2980,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,29892,1316,408,13138,901,13173,10757,470,6795,25699,304,9324,264,1009,2602,29889,13,13,797,4958,310,278,9927,310,376,8966,20657,24481,1699,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,29889,5806,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,322,7418,310,2428,29882,1489,267,322,1009,10879,373,9257,29892,727,526,777,8871,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1207,263,5995,393,2428,29882,1489,267,505,4953,263,5829,310,4966,322,8681,12232,363,1784,2305,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,14169,515,3033,6751,411,9209,292,1776,9748,470,6795,25699,304,4340,9324,264,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,2198,292,1009,266,6656,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,278,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,1009,24481,29889],"total_duration":74035790520,"load_duration":263965,"prompt_eval_count":353,"prompt_eval_duration":37044890000,"eval_count":270,"eval_duration":36989957000}
