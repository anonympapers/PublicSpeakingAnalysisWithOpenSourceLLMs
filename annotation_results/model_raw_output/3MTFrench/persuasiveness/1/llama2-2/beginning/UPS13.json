{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T17:44:09.019992565Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning, but there are also some areas where the argumentation could be improved.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that they can control lightning using lasers is quite ambitious and lacks concrete evidence to support it. While the speaker does mention that they have found a way to use lasers to control the air pressure around a storm, they do not provide any details on how this works or what kind of research they have done to back up their claim. This lack of evidence makes it difficult for the audience to fully buy into the speaker's argument.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's use of rhetorical questions and exaggerated language can come across as somewhat cheesy and unconvincing. For example, when the speaker says \"Quoi en fait ?\" (What is really going on here?), it comes across as an over-the-top attempt to sound mysterious and intelligent, rather than a genuine question. Similarly, when the speaker talks about \"remontant le temps\" (going back in time), this language could be seen as too dramatic and not credible.\n\nOn the other hand, the speaker does present some persuasive arguments regarding the potential benefits of controlling lightning using lasers. For example, they mention that it could help to reduce the risk of lightning-related accidents and damage to buildings and infrastructure. These kinds of practical applications can go a long way in convincing an audience of the speaker's message.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speaker could improve their argumentation, they do present some persuasive points that could potentially convince an audience of the value of their research.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,29892,1444,26099,9181,29899,29963,482,634,1444,7890,5178,1924,316,7890,1035,307,4630,1559,7890,904,2608,26477,29899,23088,818,4883,274,9373,743,29892,611,266,17449,427,29871,29896,29947,29900,1473,267,29892,3440,3435,610,425,1436,1577,13915,2535,19601,7628,316,425,24407,904,941,412,868,15744,17611,264,29892,1869,261,3578,1076,6520,29892,8556,1047,4467,427,29871,29906,29900,29906,29900,1190,1597,7629,5889,818,2298,316,29871,29906,29945,29900,29900,22609,29892,454,9712,3669,600,280,1437,305,1690,1318,425,715,29884,347,14751,1455,29892,22819,1318,1465,24145,633,374,634,274,496,1318,29892,8556,904,13147,787,454,289,9216,1294,22673,269,29915,524,575,3709,29892,966,2117,371,1295,269,29915,3470,29874,352,296,29892,425,260,2673,1601,371,29892,274,29915,342,454,3256,364,5818,1950,301,29915,6574,30069,1372,29889,751,7768,427,5246,1577,2581,452,28078,11818,2331,10440,2970,29892,24145,541,16933,2560,29892,4313,30069,1358,425,285,2736,276,1738,461,7890,26427,29920,29871,4277,1577,382,29882,6079,1671,2257,9073,29892,1750,260,29915,609,425,7629,5889,818,1083,609,424,454,8714,1671,454,13222,316,611,266,17449,28194,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,425,1841,1713,2535,427,1869,261,29889,951,29095,316,16605,482,316,425,285,2736,276,707,270,29915,4422,7608,427,1869,261,1354,443,8714,439,29915,309,343,263,1597,670,29872,301,29915,1466,1190,1487,869,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,16710,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,896,508,2761,3578,1076,773,1869,414,338,3755,626,2966,2738,322,425,4684,18387,10757,304,2304,372,29889,5806,278,25657,947,3585,393,896,505,1476,263,982,304,671,1869,414,304,2761,278,4799,12959,2820,263,14280,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,445,1736,470,825,2924,310,5925,896,505,2309,304,1250,701,1009,5995,29889,910,10225,310,10757,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,8072,15649,964,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,429,9921,630,4086,508,2041,4822,408,10579,923,267,29891,322,443,535,3845,3277,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,278,25657,4083,376,2182,7768,427,5246,1577,29908,313,5618,338,2289,2675,373,1244,29973,511,372,5304,4822,408,385,975,29899,1552,29899,3332,4218,304,6047,22277,2738,322,13052,296,29892,3265,1135,263,29120,457,1139,29889,20175,29892,746,278,25657,5969,2039,1048,376,1745,609,424,454,8714,29908,313,17696,1250,297,931,511,445,4086,1033,367,3595,408,2086,8541,2454,322,451,6625,1821,29889,13,13,2951,278,916,1361,29892,278,25657,947,2198,777,20408,294,573,6273,11211,278,7037,23633,310,640,22155,3578,1076,773,1869,414,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,372,1033,1371,304,10032,278,12045,310,3578,1076,29899,12817,1035,16719,322,18658,304,13814,322,22035,12425,29889,4525,17690,310,15031,8324,508,748,263,1472,982,297,17953,3277,385,20026,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,29892,896,437,2198,777,20408,294,573,3291,393,1033,19998,7602,1239,385,20026,310,278,995,310,1009,5925,29889],"total_duration":92903921441,"load_duration":294281,"prompt_eval_count":282,"prompt_eval_duration":33173425000,"eval_count":396,"eval_duration":59729537000}
