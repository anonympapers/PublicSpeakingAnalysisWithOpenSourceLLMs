The speaker presents some valid points about the benefits of using concrete, such as its resistance and affordability, but their reasoning is not particularly rigorous or well-supported.\n\nThe speaker makes some general claims about the environmental impact of concrete without providing any specific data or evidence to back them up. For example, they state that \"il est très résistant et ne coûte pas cher,\" but do not provide any information on the exact amount of resources required to produce concrete or the potential environmental impacts of its production and use.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument that concrete is the most commonly used building material in the world is not a particularly persuasive point, as it does not take into account the many other materials that are also widely used in construction, such as steel and wood.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid points about concrete, their reasoning and argumentation could be more rigorous and well-supported to make a convincing case for its use.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,454,17043,13639,425,1841,1713,553,26943,818,5278,1139,1863,296,11381,29889,751,392,16474,1671,7890,454,289,29948,880,484,29889,838,943,29892,1444,16623,443,9200,274,28059,29892,443,9200,29899,29873,307,18734,1465,443,274,28059,29889,2581,925,29872,7890,27516,966,4239,25179,787,267,29892,712,19601,454,2298,1766,17851,29889,853,286,17914,712,432,29915,1794,29057,574,29948,818,301,29915,348,1750,16623,1249,966,286,1862,285,30037,4630,29892,1444,4325,744,29892,1766,485,1617,700,29892,274,29915,342,760,449,29889,315,29915,342,9201,867,29948,29948,29892,9201,289,3222,267,29889,8748,425,9201,26744,286,29915,29874,6309,712,454,289,29948,880,484,29892,274,29915,342,2258,21873,818,10135,374,7808,29889,315,29915,342,23837,1387,29892,3503,2331,904,21553,1387,29889,8748,274,29915,342,316,26744,782,29899,24442,534,30000,1100,29889,951,289,29948,880,484,454,1775,4894,585,316,7632,454,2298,28643,782,9122,610,346,439,29915,309,707,9577,6896,22137,634,452,1302,30095,371,2331,14954,29889,1720,707,5541,29948,316,269,519,634,316,2646,7214,29892,619,29948,7006,286,3610,927,270,29915,14531,316,274,2073,1750,263,1411,29883,1924,29889,951,274,2073,707,425,2752,316,29871,29945,29995,553,904,29885,6847,13149,2122,316,274,1318,585,316,4239,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,2331,302,19351,2231,519,29889,11948,373,452,8164,409,27962,868,289,29948,880,1671,6787,533,443,704,271,2073,904,1217,29899,2818,29889,13861,6267,1437,1555,654,29892,373,14403,993,443,904,3874,369,11412,29892,5541,29948,427,10684,316,289,29948,880,484,29892,316,7013,339,568,634,316,2930,1690,1337,744,29889,341,5093,1354,373,760,277,7015,2646,1960,818,3623,381,22700,743,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,23633,310,773,18387,29892,1316,408,967,17711,322,21750,3097,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,10734,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3732,777,2498,16726,1048,278,29380,10879,310,18387,1728,13138,738,2702,848,470,10757,304,1250,963,701,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,2106,393,376,309,707,9577,6896,22137,634,452,1302,30095,371,2331,14954,1699,541,437,451,3867,738,2472,373,278,2684,5253,310,7788,3734,304,7738,18387,470,278,7037,29380,10879,29879,310,967,5802,322,671,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,18387,338,278,1556,15574,1304,5214,5518,297,278,3186,338,451,263,10734,20408,294,573,1298,29892,408,372,947,451,2125,964,3633,278,1784,916,17279,393,526,884,17644,1304,297,7632,29892,1316,408,22973,322,8112,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,18387,29892,1009,24481,322,2980,362,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,304,1207,263,17953,3277,1206,363,967,671,29889],"total_duration":58077721278,"load_duration":291543,"prompt_eval_count":345,"prompt_eval_duration":29027622000,"eval_count":235,"eval_duration":29049208000}
