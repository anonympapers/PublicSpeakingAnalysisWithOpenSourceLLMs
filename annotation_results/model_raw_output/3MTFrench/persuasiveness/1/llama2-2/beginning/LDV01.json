{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T12:50:42.050360465Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker provides some valid points and arguments regarding the reasons why people may relapse after quitting drugs, but there are also some flaws in their reasoning and delivery that detract from the overall effectiveness of the speech.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the speaker's acknowledgment of the complexity of the issue and their attempt to provide a nuanced explanation for why people may relapse. They offer a possible explanation based on the brain's response to drug use, which could be seen as a valid perspective. However, the speaker's delivery is somewhat lacking in conviction and authority, which may undermine the impact of their message.\n\nOne potential flaw in the speech is the speaker's tendency to use vague or ambiguous language, such as \"bon,\" \"dans,\" and \"éviticole.\" This can make it difficult for the listener to follow the speaker's train of thought and may detract from the overall clarity of the message. Additionally, the speaker's reliance on a single example (\"mon café du matin\") may not be sufficient to support their argument, as it is unclear how this relates to the broader issue of drug addiction.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some valid points regarding the reasons why people may relapse after quitting drugs, their delivery and language use detract from the overall effectiveness of the speech. A score of 3 out of 5 is appropriate given these factors.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1459,454,325,1690,882,29892,4145,819,316,18554,4625,20737,1136,3011,29948,316,425,4441,13000,1577,319,443,1223,296,519,634,904,386,2249,15819,29892,4875,707,270,29915,29877,30071,29889,323,29915,6698,424,12563,425,10974,29892,1671,1223,9945,19449,1750,4625,454,325,1690,1166,29892,634,19449,1750,302,29915,609,2331,5246,610,1236,332,868,4880,868,29758,262,29892,301,29915,29949,4345,707,603,29892,439,29915,348,594,352,371,10503,475,29892,263,20737,1136,3011,29948,316,425,4441,13000,782,9587,316,301,29915,18704,29889,951,23822,8146,29899,25046,29920,302,29915,342,2331,316,4048,6390,1750,263,1136,3011,29948,270,29915,328,307,1912,5278,19951,29889,7747,25810,6079,9201,2258,21873,29889,438,1481,29892,10814,29892,432,29915,485,283,29872,5646,29892,3503,432,29915,264,7468,3008,28230,316,1601,274,28059,868,1775,262,29889,365,29915,711,4026,316,286,29915,1131,5340,12866,29892,427,11172,712,7814,6664,1041,1480,9230,634,553,5291,335,743,1750,409,1209,296,425,28262,550,29889,8748,316,7199,9030,1671,339,7768,553,18554,788,919,267,325,609,337,3200,290,1050,316,425,4441,13000,553,17478,29892,8689,553,8595,7907,11469,3948,30037,6772,29889,8748,373,263,1597,282,2488,10375,1509,29892,1444,286,29915,4548,9854,29889,751,392,427,4348,29884,29892,439,29915,265,1047,4467,316,425,4441,13000,29892,980,2947,18475,296,381,2174,275,381,6079,29899,5474,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,868,818,425,4303,10500,1465,454,5147,345,585,316,425,9982,555,1759,6079,25456,29892,270,29915,459,314,1540,29889,11948,7628,316,425,544,895,316,4441,13000,29892,980,2947,8648,343,11469,553,1874,4110,818,301,29915,524,14508,868,14913,29889,22333,358,362,270,29915,29909,1341,2185,2522,538,13544,29892,6761,533,712,1487,10019,293,10799,29889,8748,274,29915,342,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,8128,777,2854,3291,322,6273,11211,278,9590,2020,2305,1122,337,13938,1156,439,5367,5883,3174,29892,541,727,526,884,777,17422,5652,297,1009,24481,322,28289,393,1439,1461,515,278,12463,2779,20193,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,25657,29915,29879,24084,19422,310,278,13644,310,278,2228,322,1009,4218,304,3867,263,4948,8362,8252,363,2020,2305,1122,337,13938,29889,2688,5957,263,1950,8252,2729,373,278,17294,29915,29879,2933,304,15721,671,29892,607,1033,367,3595,408,263,2854,18520,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,338,10579,10225,292,297,7602,2463,322,14329,29892,607,1122,563,837,457,278,10879,310,1009,2643,29889,13,13,6716,7037,285,10653,297,278,12032,338,278,25657,29915,29879,260,5197,304,671,25160,470,22363,681,4086,29892,1316,408,376,6718,1699,376,29881,550,1699,322,376,5903,277,23249,1213,910,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,322,1122,1439,1461,515,278,12463,7542,537,310,278,2643,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,12536,749,373,263,2323,1342,4852,3712,274,28059,868,1775,262,1159,1122,451,367,8002,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,408,372,338,20871,920,445,1104,1078,304,278,2545,1664,2228,310,15721,788,2463,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,11211,278,9590,2020,2305,1122,337,13938,1156,439,5367,5883,3174,29892,1009,28289,322,4086,671,1439,1461,515,278,12463,2779,20193,310,278,12032,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,338,8210,2183,1438,13879,29889],"total_duration":216477976263,"load_duration":313492,"prompt_eval_count":363,"prompt_eval_duration":51636868000,"eval_count":339,"eval_duration":164839991000}
