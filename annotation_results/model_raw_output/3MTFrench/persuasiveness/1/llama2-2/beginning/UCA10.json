{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T02:33:43.774476693Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and emotional appeals to make their point, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by using a relatable analogy to grab the audience's attention, comparing the pressure of society to the feeling of being a relieved person. They then build on this analogy by highlighting the consequences of not conforming to societal norms, such as losing one's individuality and self-respect. The speaker also uses emotional language, such as \"des imageurs\" and \"less respect,\" to emphasize the negative outcomes of not fitting in.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker does not provide any empirical evidence or logical arguments to support their claims. Additionally, the speaker's use of emotional language and rhetorical questions can come across as overly dramatic and manipulative, rather than persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker effectively uses emotional appeals and rhetorical questions to make their point, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,20594,29892,301,29915,852,561,12959,29892,316,868,10208,11728,29871,29941,29896,29889,15113,316,29910,2332,29892,966,1136,21871,2063,1437,3009,375,15210,1597,7537,19190,634,553,1967,1295,29892,29871,239,163,132,30393,1647,29892,29871,29896,29900,29900,29995,316,867,453,28018,11460,1169,29892,2123,6701,11387,316,3390,292,29892,2703,1671,29873,424,29892,29871,30860,31063,239,152,191,29973,20419,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,23023,1848,5929,1338,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,773,263,1104,17219,3483,6933,304,17229,278,20026,29915,29879,8570,29892,17420,278,12959,310,12459,304,278,11223,310,1641,263,1104,6402,2022,29889,2688,769,2048,373,445,3483,6933,491,12141,292,278,27721,310,451,14670,292,304,5374,26310,6056,29879,29892,1316,408,19035,697,29915,29879,5375,537,322,1583,29899,690,1103,29889,450,25657,884,3913,23023,1848,4086,29892,1316,408,376,2783,1967,1295,29908,322,376,2222,3390,1699,304,19310,675,278,8178,714,26807,310,451,28221,297,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,470,16667,6273,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,23023,1848,4086,322,364,9188,272,936,5155,508,2041,4822,408,975,368,8541,2454,322,11525,28524,29892,3265,1135,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,17583,3913,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889],"total_duration":44960414558,"load_duration":281988,"prompt_eval_count":82,"prompt_eval_duration":8397363000,"eval_count":276,"eval_duration":36562268000}
