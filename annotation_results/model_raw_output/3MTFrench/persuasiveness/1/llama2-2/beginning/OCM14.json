{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T04:45:31.560266064Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and repetition to emphasize their points, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker argues that the French government's plans to combat radicalization lack functionality due to a lack of structure and scientific basis. They use the example of the national prevention plan published in 2018 to illustrate this point, highlighting the absence of a clear definition of radicalization. While this is a valid criticism, the speaker could have provided more evidence or examples to support their claim.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument that the concept of radicalization lacks structure and scientific basis is not fully developed. They do not provide any concrete definitions or explanations of what radicalization means, leaving the audience with a vague understanding of the term.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid points about the limitations of the French government's plans to combat radicalization, they could have provided more rigorous reasoning and evidence to support their argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,9669,29892,15557,634,3681,29889,8316,275,4213,267,29892,7732,11875,2701,316,8441,29892,5227,407,2406,270,29915,332,1171,610,553,1098,296,1446,15115,9230,29892,25659,818,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,24818,4371,29889,838,943,29892,3700,818,5278,1757,815,29892,966,19397,29879,970,29879,427,3444,3435,3984,427,2058,553,13900,316,15481,371,8474,425,24818,4371,29892,3503,1750,13149,6311,767,802,316,18165,20809,7719,29889,6803,339,7768,1577,315,29915,342,301,29915,348,553,21420,712,1444,1020,568,1465,611,266,17449,634,712,8556,599,787,8689,21285,29889,951,1203,361,316,5278,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,19397,2654,265,1089,18165,20809,2131,634,6366,562,2131,818,7015,13900,29889,838,943,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,309,452,2947,2331,2535,425,17837,316,24818,4371,7847,802,274,29915,342,4875,1750,707,427,4556,270,29915,24430,1577,6340,302,29915,29874,2331,316,3829,29889,405,29915,29891,11099,333,1387,29892,302,29915,29891,9638,22781,29889,1459,17488,29892,1465,454,25915,316,611,266,17449,29892,1444,592,26099,26842,404,29948,782,3814,4797,316,7175,7316,316,425,24818,4371,14649,1318,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29947,610,454,17284,29889,8748,818,7209,29899,29881,681,2062,895,29892,373,8164,343,8689,454,3184,24818,4371,3503,2331,1597,25642,10098,29892,2257,712,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,29889,20513,499,271,29892,7890,29871,22730,13220,29892,302,29915,1639,558,7342,610,1465,5278,17837,4191,29892,10814,7890,3031,569,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,21159,654,304,19310,675,1009,3291,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,1852,1041,393,278,5176,5874,29915,29879,13900,304,15499,24818,2133,10225,9863,2861,304,263,10225,310,3829,322,16021,8405,29889,2688,671,278,1342,310,278,4797,5557,291,3814,6369,297,29871,29906,29900,29896,29947,304,28475,445,1298,29892,12141,292,278,18070,310,263,2821,5023,310,24818,2133,29889,5806,445,338,263,2854,29035,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,470,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,6964,310,24818,2133,425,4684,3829,322,16021,8405,338,451,8072,8906,29889,2688,437,451,3867,738,18387,15848,470,7309,800,310,825,24818,2133,2794,29892,10124,278,20026,411,263,25160,8004,310,278,1840,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,278,27028,310,278,5176,5874,29915,29879,13900,304,15499,24818,2133,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29889],"total_duration":64304558263,"load_duration":196923,"prompt_eval_count":296,"prompt_eval_duration":31037698000,"eval_count":244,"eval_duration":33266137000}
