{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T00:19:22.118852074Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigor in their argumentation. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker does a decent job of presenting their argument in a clear and concise manner. They provide some interesting insights into the properties of water and how it can be affected by cancer, which could potentially sway some listeners. However, there are some areas where they could have been more persuasive, such as when they argue that the cancer is affecting \"un million de personnes\" (i.e., one million people). This kind of hyperbole undermines their credibility and makes it harder to take their argument seriously.\n2. Rigor: The speaker's reasoning is not always rigorous, and there are some logical fallacies in their argumentation. For example, they claim that the cancer is affecting \"tout le monde\" (i.e., everyone), but this is clearly not true, as they later acknowledge that the mortality rate is only 40%. They also make a dubious claim about how water molecules are transformed into a \"mousse\" that can spread throughout the body, without providing any scientific evidence to support this idea.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in their argumentation, there are areas where they could improve in terms of both persuasiveness and rigor.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,29892,1444,26099,4824,1654,819,634,1444,6427,8284,1190,301,29915,1893,1151,270,29915,348,23900,316,301,29915,14531,29889,838,943,29892,373,707,454,1261,3825,1671,339,7768,19601,29892,443,4824,1387,455,264,325,993,1539,2484,1601,904,510,346,262,1465,966,2756,7147,316,425,25974,457,29889,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,925,882,1671,623,9555,1597,15217,2134,1173,634,316,13164,2730,11771,270,29915,24209,344,29889,8748,1671,339,7768,707,29899,346,712,454,286,29915,524,29948,23458,818,443,23900,316,301,29915,14531,29892,301,29915,14531,409,260,29915,29874,782,7067,29973,1459,346,439,29915,309,6094,1908,316,301,29915,14531,29892,707,443,1775,4894,585,712,19601,427,11172,712,4824,1387,455,264,29892,1444,872,275,29892,707,29899,29884,29899,29881,29915,29891,29889,838,943,29892,2257,23900,316,301,29915,14531,29892,1354,1444,325,1759,6023,261,3420,6311,966,594,6544,29883,1237,29892,966,29026,16157,267,634,966,18554,19406,29887,2406,29892,2535,443,2025,316,5758,284,2131,1661,619,424,29871,29946,29900,15543,838,943,29892,1444,325,2736,23469,26154,260,3121,267,29892,274,29915,342,1597,26744,1190,443,7284,29889,28079,454,9122,707,29899,309,439,29915,309,2947,4327,261,301,29915,14531,1190,27612,980,409,13618,427,20319,316,286,681,344,1750,2947,14954,4630,427,325,1466,454,18062,868,14913,29889,315,29915,342,5278,286,681,344,270,29915,14531,712,432,29915,1794,3667,277,29889,8748,782,29899,6144,30001,270,29915,1893,566,631,443,23900,2535,316,425,4824,1387,29892,1444,325,1759,6426,369,2298,10042,427,26842,404,424,3479,2298,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,297,1009,2980,362,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,263,27189,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29889,2688,3867,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,4426,310,4094,322,920,372,508,367,15201,491,23900,29892,607,1033,19998,269,1582,777,11621,414,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,505,1063,901,20408,294,573,29892,1316,408,746,896,27754,393,278,23900,338,6602,292,376,348,7284,316,18554,29908,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,697,7284,2305,467,910,2924,310,11266,833,280,563,837,1475,1009,6625,4127,322,3732,372,22622,304,2125,1009,2980,25798,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,272,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,322,727,526,777,16667,285,9864,2478,297,1009,2980,362,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,278,23900,338,6602,292,376,24442,454,9122,29908,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,14332,511,541,445,338,9436,451,1565,29892,408,896,2678,18145,5485,393,278,5758,2877,6554,338,871,29871,29946,29900,15543,2688,884,1207,263,15416,2738,5995,1048,920,4094,13206,21337,526,27615,964,263,376,29885,681,344,29908,393,508,9677,10106,278,3573,29892,1728,13138,738,16021,10757,304,2304,445,2969,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,1009,2980,362,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,297,4958,310,1716,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,29889],"total_duration":155644995532,"load_duration":286318,"prompt_eval_count":322,"prompt_eval_duration":36473409000,"eval_count":313,"eval_duration":119170674000}
