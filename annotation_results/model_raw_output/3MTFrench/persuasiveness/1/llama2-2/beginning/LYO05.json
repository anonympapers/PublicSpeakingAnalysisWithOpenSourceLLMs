{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T15:10:23.299928938Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points about the potential benefits of using Big Data in law enforcement, such as improved crime prevention and the ability to solve mysteries. However, the speech also contains some fallacies and exaggerated claims that detract from its overall persuasiveness.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that Big Data can \"perceive\" criminality is overstated. While data analysis can certainly help identify patterns and trends in crime, it cannot literally \"see\" or \"hear\" criminal activity. This exaggeration undermines the credibility of the speaker's argument.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's assertion that Big Data can \"take the leadership of our bonniere planet\" is far-fetched and lacks evidence. There is no indication that Big Data has the capacity to control or govern entire planets, let alone the ability to do so in a benevolent manner.\n\nThirdly, the speaker's use of hyperbole (\"1000 lieux de l'intelligence glob√©e\") is unnecessary and detracts from the speech's persuasive value. Such exaggerated language can be seen as an attempt to manipulate the audience rather than present a well-reasoned argument.\n\nIn conclusion, while the speaker presents some valid points about the potential benefits of Big Data in law enforcement, the speech's overall persuasiveness is undermined by fallacies and exaggerated claims. A score of 3 out of 5 is appropriate for this transcript.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,29845,29892,301,29915,29948,11154,7997,3630,634,10974,1465,425,6701,16549,29892,373,16067,454,5161,802,270,29915,5128,12416,1597,1045,30058,371,316,282,4182,1295,2858,1547,13876,316,6094,29539,553,1437,29890,1446,17818,344,29889,383,5793,3479,2889,17330,553,946,2063,12128,267,29892,1661,270,29915,1062,2390,324,261,29892,18729,2947,316,577,29875,29892,21394,316,13568,294,4467,409,5518,895,29889,6212,2509,29892,9461,1524,634,14931,302,29915,342,2331,658,262,29892,7997,350,1883,29915,5411,707,269,29915,1300,336,30058,26129,29889,2664,9644,3435,1671,454,285,436,1875,6094,1064,5711,261,27093,712,270,29915,14559,29892,443,275,316,6267,7019,339,7289,409,17508,10978,818,966,7019,428,29876,743,818,425,1667,966,1841,344,2993,316,274,30057,7586,1203,3783,610,966,339,1379,1301,277,296,454,2787,399,680,2563,634,409,1671,410,6772,914,301,29915,26029,2131,270,29915,348,6079,5820,424,4439,29889,6101,1354,1444,26099,269,30095,29878,712,10741,270,29915,14056,7890,24722,5646,316,11062,5246,316,439,7768,1444,2453,1314,610,1358,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,28194,301,29915,265,5246,1841,9625,3479,7997,3630,1465,425,10974,29892,373,14034,1597,2280,13052,2016,15390,270,29915,296,1654,546,425,22161,537,992,533,316,639,2265,966,16624,5908,316,7814,410,4569,20881,436,743,29889,1551,17043,13871,425,8825,1487,13545,8595,2331,29892,274,29915,342,8556,4224,5128,12628,712,5278,2428,524,28286,8164,4175,2257,9484,886,26742,2445,347,270,29915,19388,1387,1671,23532,454,26001,316,24145,289,3409,631,3814,12973,10767,29884,29889,2581,22847,29892,3503,966,12563,16132,16253,7147,316,451,3709,712,8556,1047,4467,818,29871,29896,29900,29900,29900,3804,1314,316,301,29915,524,28286,13149,1318,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,7037,23633,310,773,7997,3630,297,4307,24555,13561,29892,1316,408,16710,17268,5557,291,322,278,11509,304,4505,22277,583,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,884,3743,777,285,9864,2478,322,429,9921,630,16726,393,1439,1461,515,967,12463,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,7997,3630,508,376,546,346,573,29908,22161,537,338,975,303,630,29889,5806,848,7418,508,8959,1371,12439,15038,322,534,1975,297,17268,29892,372,2609,22830,376,4149,29908,470,376,354,279,29908,22161,6354,29889,910,429,9921,362,563,837,1475,278,6625,4127,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,7997,3630,508,376,19730,278,26001,310,1749,10814,1240,406,15754,29908,338,2215,29899,9155,287,322,425,4684,10757,29889,1670,338,694,4221,362,393,7997,3630,756,278,13284,304,2761,470,4095,4152,3814,1691,29892,1235,7432,278,11509,304,437,577,297,263,13982,1555,296,8214,29889,13,13,1349,1823,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,4852,29896,29900,29900,29900,3804,1314,316,301,29915,524,28286,13149,1318,1159,338,19039,322,1439,1461,29879,515,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,573,995,29889,10506,429,9921,630,4086,508,367,3595,408,385,4218,304,26749,278,20026,3265,1135,2198,263,1532,29899,23147,287,2980,29889,13,13,797,15997,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,7037,23633,310,7997,3630,297,4307,24555,13561,29892,278,12032,29915,29879,12463,20408,294,20193,338,563,837,1312,491,285,9864,2478,322,429,9921,630,16726,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,338,8210,363,445,1301,924,29889],"total_duration":155480752509,"load_duration":251421,"prompt_eval_count":347,"prompt_eval_duration":32070333000,"eval_count":360,"eval_duration":123409588000}
