{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T14:50:44.62631583Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does a decent job of crafting a convincing message and presenting their argument in a clear and organized manner. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message more compelling.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of using visual aids to illustrate their points, but at times, the explanation of the concepts can be simplistic and lack depth. For example, when explaining the concept of \"intigre,\" the speaker simply defines it as \"a tiger\" without providing any additional context or explanation. This lack of detail makes it difficult for the audience to fully understand the concept and its significance.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's tone can come across as a bit too casual and flippant at times, which may undermine their authority and credibility on the topic. A more serious and professional tone would have made the speech more persuasive and convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does a decent job of presenting their message, there are areas where they could improve to make their argument more compelling and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6298,966,2181,1934,29892,9360,818,26003,29892,373,24684,1249,8689,443,260,335,276,29892,427,6808,681,29892,443,260,335,276,29892,427,6808,681,29892,443,260,335,276,29892,6056,6311,1444,2906,8356,2145,2853,4191,29871,4277,439,29915,1808,13299,488,980,343,263,316,10098,3503,1444,966,3438,1759,427,29871,29929,29900,1473,267,12866,1444,325,1759,633,336,30058,914,443,7006,29889,1551,2947,29262,29892,443,470,346,29892,427,6808,681,29892,443,470,346,29892,427,470,346,29892,2992,29889,8407,22591,29892,9360,980,343,263,1597,15217,1967,1750,29892,25763,7890,29892,282,1947,439,29915,309,269,29915,23121,270,29915,348,470,346,29889,1588,2093,6079,29892,1750,1671,443,260,335,276,29892,610,29888,1249,29892,1444,1597,289,7293,15217,1671,425,4655,2131,270,29915,14056,7890,623,598,454,286,17914,29871,1654,29889,478,681,302,29915,22730,2331,10440,13162,23855,882,1437,3364,29948,610,301,29915,524,295,335,663,19069,11381,29889,7747,712,7890,325,10281,316,9073,29892,29871,4277,8164,7848,1465,454,2432,9874,1871,15819,868,4933,6509,2123,623,7771,790,482,5092,1387,29889,478,681,8992,29920,623,3780,29892,2779,19882,29892,443,470,346,270,29915,524,335,276,29892,818,8019,270,29915,735,331,552,29889,2598,18848,1136,2488,818,9073,9073,425,6701,12784,818,553,22420,14075,29889,2664,8324,316,425,623,7771,790,482,5092,1387,3435,7622,290,2634,7586,29892,16455,344,29899,3027,10283,28148,29892,26192,316,12389,29882,293,2540,28273,267,29892,3503,5695,25238,9948,12789,744,29892,27219,428,5092,1387,29892,373,1671,8356,27962,425,29627,1318,818,301,29915,29948,506,2131,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,2257,17887,3256,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,263,27189,4982,310,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,292,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,19098,8214,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2643,901,752,7807,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,773,7604,263,4841,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,541,472,3064,29892,278,8252,310,278,22001,508,367,5466,4695,322,10225,10809,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,24232,278,6964,310,376,524,335,276,1699,278,25657,3763,17645,372,408,376,29874,260,4087,29908,1728,13138,738,5684,3030,470,8252,29889,910,10225,310,9493,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,8072,2274,278,6964,322,967,26002,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,508,2041,4822,408,263,2586,2086,3209,950,322,285,492,407,424,472,3064,29892,607,1122,563,837,457,1009,14329,322,6625,4127,373,278,11261,29889,319,901,10676,322,10257,16225,723,505,1754,278,12032,901,20408,294,573,322,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,263,27189,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2643,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,752,7807,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":72990379815,"load_duration":341274,"prompt_eval_count":331,"prompt_eval_duration":35795216000,"eval_count":258,"eval_duration":37194233000}
