The speaker presents a clear and concise message about the importance of vision and how it works, using simple language and relatable examples. They also highlight an important issue related to vision, specifically the impact of a genetic disease called retinitis pigmentosa on thousands of French people.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is rigorous and well-structured, breaking down the complex process of vision into smaller components and explaining how they work together. They use technical terms appropriately and provide concrete examples to illustrate their points, making their message more convincing and credible.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speech could be improved to make it even more persuasive. For example, the speaker could have provided more context on why this issue is important and how it affects the lives of those affected. Additionally, they could have used more emotional language and storytelling techniques to make the message more impactful and memorable.\n\nOverall, the speech is well-crafted and effectively conveys the importance of vision and the need for further research and support for those affected by retinitis pigmentosa.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,818,9411,29889,2581,325,1759,844,22687,610,7890,926,261,1597,22577,1139,29889,5462,7890,325,993,29920,316,425,301,29915,267,19428,1354,1444,7890,766,966,286,1862,29892,289,30057,880,261,634,1826,1577,2581,26099,3058,712,966,2298,330,473,29885,4167,270,29915,14056,7890,427,10420,10978,818,425,330,1265,29889,11948,22572,29915,15669,29892,1444,452,325,1759,2331,7890,610,1358,316,330,1265,3503,316,425,18551,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,966,289,30057,880,1089,634,966,378,4515,3435,553,3038,2540,5814,1237,1465,24145,29871,30106,309,634,8556,19172,296,316,8689,29889,2664,289,30057,880,1089,8556,19172,296,316,8689,301,29915,812,8631,634,966,378,4515,8556,19172,296,316,8689,454,8694,29889,461,707,29899,346,712,29871,4277,18165,484,1577,838,943,3022,29878,23855,882,29892,818,301,29915,524,14508,316,7015,3038,2540,29892,8556,1029,787,1597,3209,6332,316,29871,29929,6062,29948,21337,4191,282,6223,29920,29899,280,8689,427,22916,29892,1750,18165,484,26245,634,8694,29889,19551,802,425,19703,5289,18331,1465,301,29915,30106,309,29892,274,29915,342,8164,29899,5474,1601,904,10936,29892,325,609,2117,357,425,19703,5289,634,409,18750,1803,276,454,2643,1671,20563,3709,634,4327,261,5278,19703,5289,427,443,20536,2643,1750,2947,564,3511,9291,29915,585,5147,345,585,29889,1459,8474,29892,269,29915,309,343,263,1597,29342,284,347,1465,454,10814,18165,17239,316,7015,3038,2540,634,316,7015,6062,29948,21337,29892,8532,425,3209,6332,269,29915,2749,9061,29889,315,29915,342,454,3209,1671,2298,316,29871,29941,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1352,6899,29892,5697,1169,634,22114,29892,1750,3435,1098,9030,1597,4439,328,347,6094,19971,10812,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,425,1841,29873,348,568,282,647,29874,895,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,6287,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2643,1048,278,13500,310,18551,322,920,372,1736,29892,773,2560,4086,322,1104,17219,6455,29889,2688,884,12141,385,4100,2228,4475,304,18551,29892,10816,278,10879,310,263,2531,7492,17135,2000,3240,2344,275,282,335,358,3628,373,17202,310,5176,2305,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,29892,16679,1623,278,4280,1889,310,18551,964,7968,7117,322,24232,920,896,664,4208,29889,2688,671,16905,4958,7128,2486,322,3867,18387,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,3907,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,322,6625,1821,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,304,1207,372,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,373,2020,445,2228,338,4100,322,920,372,6602,29879,278,12080,310,1906,15201,29889,19814,29892,896,1033,505,1304,901,23023,1848,4086,322,5828,29873,7807,13698,304,1207,278,2643,901,10879,1319,322,26959,519,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,12032,338,1532,29899,17293,287,322,17583,378,345,952,278,13500,310,18551,322,278,817,363,4340,5925,322,2304,363,1906,15201,491,3240,2344,275,282,335,358,3628,29889],"total_duration":63186076780,"load_duration":194917,"prompt_eval_count":355,"prompt_eval_duration":30358454000,"eval_count":263,"eval_duration":32826834000}
