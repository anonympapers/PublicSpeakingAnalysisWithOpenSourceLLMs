{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T00:37:21.986927308Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker does a decent job of presenting their argument and using rhetorical devices to make their point, but there are some areas where they could improve.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's use of humor and irony is effective in engaging the audience, but it also makes their argument feel less serious and persuasive. While a bit of humor can be helpful in making a speech more relatable and memorable, it's important to strike the right balance between being funny and being convincing.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's use of logic and reasoning is not always rigorous. They make some generalizations and assumptions without providing sufficient evidence or logical deductions to support their claims. For example, their argument that all passers-by are hausse (i.e., overcharge) without providing any data or examples to back it up feels unsatisfying and unpersuasive.\n\nLastly, the speaker's language and tone can be improved. At times, they use informal language and slang terms that may not be appropriate for a public speech. Additionally, their tone can come across as dismissive or flippant at times, which may undermine their message and credibility.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in terms of creativity and humor, they could improve their argumentation and delivery to make a more convincing and persuasive speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,1794,1597,1139,1671,7890,2257,29627,2529,9854,29889,6101,1444,7890,766,29871,29929,17478,29892,7890,282,1947,29920,818,1577,9070,29892,6094,616,29889,11948,16134,424,29892,1354,1444,7890,766,29871,29953,3031,13116,29892,9515,29892,9515,29892,29871,4277,452,7890,610,280,2331,29889,382,29882,6079,1671,29873,424,29892,1444,610,280,316,425,6701,12784,29892,3503,1465,611,23662,2131,29892,454,18371,283,23589,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,1444,26099,4581,29899,30062,10936,29899,29931,29915,29909,1505,276,29889,6803,18371,283,23589,29889,8396,29892,3431,29889,11948,432,29915,1794,301,29915,351,663,270,29915,562,2388,18303,634,316,7199,9030,9411,7015,2298,367,585,19462,270,29915,2249,8194,1671,23872,634,611,767,29888,1690,347,29892,425,1055,9948,316,10713,10505,324,747,743,289,10126,743,18371,283,453,583,29889,951,2298,367,585,11510,631,868,9122,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,9411,966,1209,4285,447,375,344,29889,6803,1597,2637,7734,409,767,455,1908,29892,425,5802,316,409,286,749,263,1671,541,270,29915,5474,9691,29884,782,544,2487,2249,279,29948,11555,29892,7847,274,29915,342,1766,5606,11555,19398,316,7015,10918,9351,782,544,2487,440,283,1136,3011,7289,29889,11948,1354,7015,409,767,1760,452,432,29915,1794,443,760,29892,454,1766,5606,11555,452,8164,2331,325,9030,316,10918,9351,29889,7740,424,316,12912,2853,29892,818,7890,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,263,27189,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,322,773,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,27448,322,3805,2592,338,11828,297,3033,6751,278,20026,29892,541,372,884,3732,1009,2980,4459,3109,10676,322,20408,294,573,29889,5806,263,2586,310,27448,508,367,8444,297,3907,263,12032,901,1104,17219,322,26959,519,29892,372,29915,29879,4100,304,21283,278,1492,17346,1546,1641,2090,1460,322,1641,17953,3277,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,5900,322,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29889,2688,1207,777,2498,17063,322,20813,1728,13138,8002,10757,470,16667,21049,1953,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,2980,393,599,1209,414,29899,1609,526,447,375,344,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,975,23367,29897,1728,13138,738,848,470,6455,304,1250,372,701,23880,9644,27685,5414,322,443,6774,29884,294,573,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4086,322,16225,508,367,16710,29889,2180,3064,29892,896,671,1871,284,4086,322,2243,574,4958,393,1122,451,367,8210,363,263,970,12032,29889,19814,29892,1009,16225,508,2041,4822,408,18918,573,470,285,492,407,424,472,3064,29892,607,1122,563,837,457,1009,2643,322,6625,4127,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,4958,310,907,28157,322,27448,29892,896,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,322,28289,304,1207,263,901,17953,3277,322,20408,294,573,12032,29889],"total_duration":146183835610,"load_duration":262532,"prompt_eval_count":275,"prompt_eval_duration":29386306000,"eval_count":324,"eval_duration":116796636000}
