The speaker does present some valid points about the importance of addressing social issues and the potential benefits of doing so, but there are also some weaknesses in their reasoning and argumentation.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that \"les économies socials, les évolutions de l'économie sociale, c'est très important\" is not well supported by evidence. While it is true that social economies and social evolution are important, the speaker does not provide any concrete examples or data to back up their claim. This lack of evidence makes it difficult to evaluate the validity of their argument.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's assertion that \"les déprits socials n'est pas beaucoup d'edonné pour décrire un environnement commercial favorable\" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that social issues can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line, the speaker does not acknowledge the potential benefits of addressing these issues. For example, implementing socially responsible practices can improve a company's reputation and attract customers who value ethical business practices.\n\nFinally, the speaker's claim that \"Mare 6, portera la contribution de l'économie social en est le dire, les bilans d'économie socials\" is not well supported by evidence. While Mare 6 may have some expertise in the field of social economics, the speaker does not provide any concrete examples or data to back up their claim.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some valid points about the importance of addressing social issues, their reasoning and argumentation are weakened by a lack of evidence and a failure to acknowledge the potential benefits of doing so. Therefore, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,966,12278,1179,14858,5059,275,29892,2971,279,634,260,30057,1912,1750,3435,1661,4991,743,4625,316,4662,280,1295,29889,2664,14979,23435,1750,269,29915,342,9577,19398,3911,634,439,29915,2719,1424,294,277,966,20542,7907,966,10890,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,966,23837,583,5374,1338,29892,966,904,4068,29879,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,29892,274,29915,342,9577,4100,29889,2664,4292,9230,634,425,15253,347,5374,1338,325,609,301,29915,5474,9577,25595,358,29889,2664,1766,23469,735,1277,10120,425,11896,1190,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,1465,454,4092,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,301,29915,11569,1690,272,882,316,796,536,1481,980,302,29915,342,2331,10814,1671,966,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,29889,2664,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,302,29915,342,2331,21394,270,29915,287,3409,29948,1671,1437,699,276,443,12471,17239,12128,7853,519,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,980,302,29915,342,2331,1950,1671,534,8885,425,11896,29889,21678,29871,29953,29892,1277,10120,425,11896,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,427,707,454,2970,29892,966,13181,550,270,29915,29948,4599,347,5374,1338,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,3211,292,5264,5626,322,278,7037,23633,310,2599,577,29892,541,727,526,884,777,8062,2264,267,297,1009,24481,322,2980,362,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,376,793,23837,583,5374,1338,29892,966,904,4068,29879,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,25881,29892,274,29915,342,9577,4100,29908,338,451,1532,6969,491,10757,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,5264,7766,583,322,5264,14675,526,4100,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,6455,470,848,304,1250,701,1009,5995,29889,910,10225,310,10757,3732,372,5189,304,14707,278,2854,537,310,1009,2980,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,376,793,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,302,29915,342,2331,21394,270,29915,287,3409,29948,1671,1437,699,276,443,12471,17239,12128,7853,519,29908,338,451,9186,16232,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,5264,5626,508,505,263,7282,10879,373,263,5001,29915,29879,5970,1196,29892,278,25657,947,451,18145,5485,278,7037,23633,310,3211,292,1438,5626,29889,1152,1342,29892,16049,5374,635,14040,23274,508,11157,263,5001,29915,29879,19821,322,13978,20330,1058,995,11314,936,5381,23274,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,376,29924,598,29871,29953,29892,1277,10120,425,11896,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,427,707,454,2970,29892,966,13181,550,270,29915,29948,4599,347,5374,1338,29908,338,451,1532,6969,491,10757,29889,5806,21678,29871,29953,1122,505,777,17924,895,297,278,1746,310,5264,7766,1199,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,6455,470,848,304,1250,701,1009,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,3211,292,5264,5626,29892,1009,24481,322,2980,362,526,8062,6419,491,263,10225,310,10757,322,263,10672,304,18145,5485,278,7037,23633,310,2599,577,29889,7857,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":173444633431,"load_duration":245224,"prompt_eval_count":229,"prompt_eval_duration":23638016000,"eval_count":415,"eval_duration":149805717000}
