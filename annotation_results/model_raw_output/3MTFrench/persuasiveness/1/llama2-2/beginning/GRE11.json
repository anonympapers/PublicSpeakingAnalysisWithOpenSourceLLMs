{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T12:17:38.319765431Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and data to support their claim that there is an epidemic of madness caused by the spread of music, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that it provides specific numbers and statistics to back up the speaker's claims. For example, the speaker mentions that there are 100 million cases of madness per year, and that 2.5% of people become infected each year. These numbers help to convey the scope and severity of the problem.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker claims that the lack of medical infrastructure in developing countries is a major factor in the spread of madness, but they do not provide any evidence or data to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's argument that the maladie is caused by the spread of music could be more nuanced and take into account other possible factors, such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare, or social isolation.\n\nOverall, while the speech presents some convincing arguments, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence to fully persuade the audience of the urgency of the problem.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,29896,29900,29900,14746,316,10636,29887,352,29871,29945,29892,29871,29900,29892,712,1804,28821,7015,5419,29889,29871,29896,29900,29900,14746,274,29915,342,454,5419,316,3209,1067,2172,1912,316,270,292,434,610,385,29892,425,270,292,434,707,1597,297,20309,325,3055,280,18750,895,610,425,15188,29889,29871,29906,29892,29945,274,29915,342,454,1671,1760,482,316,18554,1750,427,6808,14785,18402,19951,29889,382,3298,359,274,29915,342,302,4894,264,3503,274,29915,342,454,521,2593,276,454,2298,4100,29889,438,29884,868,11387,454,2298,599,2817,424,1559,274,29915,342,454,5419,316,1020,667,1237,6366,3302,634,316,325,5753,1144,14458,13876,410,6772,357,5278,4439,328,347,904,5935,2249,1387,29889,10793,4439,328,347,409,13089,1249,9577,325,568,29889,1605,2093,410,1173,316,425,10283,1524,661,347,4875,409,13089,1249,26154,1465,966,9744,7006,16797,743,29889,997,447,5059,895,22035,12425,10283,936,767,802,316,24127,634,316,1775,4894,295,29889,1720,21668,12866,946,381,25595,358,29889,6803,18729,980,19947,553,6851,29889,6097,20564,610,425,7175,7316,553,4439,328,583,2535,553,19966,575,1027,2701,29892,13547,712,966,17564,293,2247,634,4239,29875,30000,29885,882,610,301,29915,1639,7316,10283,28148,1465,966,21426,2106,316,425,4439,328,347,29889,11948,8532,29892,3440,24684,787,29899,29876,681,1437,4951,381,818,7594,2106,409,24889,1249,4439,1943,10042,270,29915,1639,15470,29973,6803,18729,980,21668,1437,18821,261,425,1109,29883,1318,316,425,4439,328,347,29889,422,1004,610,17488,29892,373,1539,13933,425,26702,427,3677,293,272,915,316,425,270,292,434,1465,454,13625,29889,8748,18729,1671,316,9577,285,1794,569,26702,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,848,304,2304,1009,5995,393,727,338,385,9358,680,13076,310,10395,2264,8581,491,278,9677,310,4696,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,372,8128,2702,3694,322,13964,304,1250,701,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,727,526,29871,29896,29900,29900,7284,4251,310,10395,2264,639,1629,29892,322,393,29871,29906,29889,29945,29995,310,2305,4953,3041,26458,1269,1629,29889,4525,3694,1371,304,27769,278,6874,322,2775,537,310,278,1108,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,16726,393,278,10225,310,16083,22035,12425,297,14338,10916,338,263,4655,7329,297,278,9677,310,10395,2264,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,10757,470,848,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,4439,328,347,338,8581,491,278,9677,310,4696,1033,367,901,4948,8362,322,2125,964,3633,916,1950,13879,29892,1316,408,25273,1017,29892,10225,310,2130,304,9045,18020,29892,470,5264,11695,362,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,8072,20408,1943,278,20026,310,278,5065,14703,310,278,1108,29889],"total_duration":127981321668,"load_duration":319316,"prompt_eval_count":336,"prompt_eval_duration":30127795000,"eval_count":296,"eval_duration":97852595000}
