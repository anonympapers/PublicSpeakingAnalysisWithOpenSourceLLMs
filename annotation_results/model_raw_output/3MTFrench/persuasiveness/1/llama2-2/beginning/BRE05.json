{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T00:47:01.141888138Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker is able to effectively use rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \"On a tous déjà fait des rêves\") and anecdotes (e.g., the story about Bob) to engage the audience and make their message more relatable. However, there are some areas where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes some claims about the capabilities of bacteria without providing sufficient evidence or scientific backing. For example, they mention that bacteria can modify our behaviors, but do not provide any research or studies to support this claim.\n2. Oversimplification: The speaker's explanation of symbiotic relationships between bacteria and humans is oversimplified and lacks detail. They could benefit from providing more information on the complexities of these relationships and how they impact human health.\n3. Lack of clarity: At times, the speaker’s message can be unclear or vague. For example, they mention that bacteria can protect us against diseases and parasites, but do not provide any specific examples or explanations of how this works.\n\nOverall, while the speaker is able to engage the audience with their storytelling and rhetorical devices, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1551,263,9411,20737,5246,553,364,30037,1960,634,534,6916,29892,3503,427,266,17449,29892,373,282,1947,13547,944,818,1487,29140,439,29915,265,25921,610,454,6664,440,276,1597,13618,270,29915,555,347,29889,2581,29758,818,640,29948,1601,16825,364,30037,345,29892,8532,27786,7890,1970,441,519,358,29889,9353,2257,364,30037,345,29892,432,29915,28899,275,443,2653,790,1617,946,374,29899,29886,29948,634,611,715,1647,29889,1605,5903,568,29892,432,29915,1794,2665,29875,443,4880,926,29948,1190,19601,29889,315,29915,342,18916,712,1444,301,29915,1794,18679,29889,951,437,312,5411,427,1750,286,29915,26739,1249,29892,2535,7015,22114,25081,21158,634,872,1999,1709,16568,1173,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,4224,24969,316,8019,443,7006,2298,658,262,1190,425,715,1647,1671,7848,22024,339,1924,29889,315,29915,342,18916,712,432,29915,1794,5246,443,16731,316,7991,29892,443,14857,2653,790,1617,29889,1551,269,29915,342,9577,6079,875,355,29884,29889,8748,427,766,712,29892,427,26534,329,29892,432,29915,1794,623,3780,712,8556,29892,966,2298,22114,29892,373,7905,553,289,627,29948,2722,1750,409,274,496,10978,1465,7814,3038,2540,634,1750,16165,370,277,1249,2535,8556,29889,1720,966,263,16794,29948,553,5016,5365,4769,29889,315,29915,342,29871,4277,29973,8748,980,592,1153,535,4904,712,7015,5016,5365,4769,1750,325,4244,993,427,5016,5365,4769,2535,8556,7446,1564,993,8556,410,6772,914,8474,553,4439,328,583,29892,2123,316,19449,634,7814,610,294,3246,29889,15113,21028,262,1934,10440,29892,980,286,29915,29874,610,12898,316,289,627,29948,2722,2117,1849,316,878,6832,743,7814,20299,4110,29889,315,29915,342,1671,29871,4277,439,29915,265,6303,18916,2535,7991,29889,1551,6303,553,1302,29899,29890,22730,1465,553,1518,4894,2063,20299,882,2122,29889,1551,2906,1249,263,1241,966,14954,1173,1295,818,6628,1314,7199,9030,427,439,7768,316,2560,5697,3246,289,627,29948,2722,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,671,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,2951,263,9411,20737,5246,553,364,30037,1960,1159,322,385,687,29881,4769,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,278,5828,1048,7991,29897,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,777,16726,1048,278,27108,310,289,5761,423,1728,13138,8002,10757,470,16021,27436,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,289,5761,423,508,6623,1749,4010,18930,29892,541,437,451,3867,738,5925,470,11898,304,2304,445,5995,29889,13,29906,29889,438,874,13699,2450,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,8252,310,5016,5365,13574,21702,1546,289,5761,423,322,25618,338,288,874,13699,2164,322,425,4684,9493,29889,2688,1033,14169,515,13138,901,2472,373,278,4280,1907,310,1438,21702,322,920,896,10879,5199,9045,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,30010,29879,2643,508,367,20871,470,25160,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,289,5761,423,508,12566,502,2750,10267,2129,322,610,294,3246,29892,541,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,7309,800,310,920,445,1736,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,338,2221,304,3033,482,278,20026,411,1009,5828,29873,7807,322,364,9188,272,936,9224,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889],"total_duration":162818768411,"load_duration":317683,"prompt_eval_count":382,"prompt_eval_duration":42250548000,"eval_count":323,"eval_duration":120567255000}
