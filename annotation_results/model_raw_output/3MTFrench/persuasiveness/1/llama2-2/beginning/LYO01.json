{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T15:17:27.503800714Z","response":"For the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker presents some interesting ideas and concepts related to the phenomenon of light emitted by certain materials, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and convincing. Here are some specific points:\n\n1. Lack of clear evidence: While the speaker mentions that certain materials can emit light, they do not provide any concrete evidence or examples to support their claims. This lack of empirical evidence makes it difficult to fully convince the listener of the validity of their argument.\n2. Inconsistent terminology: The speaker uses terms like \"mécanou l'humine essence\" and \"flâches de lumière,\" which are not commonly used in scientific discourse. This can make it difficult for listeners to fully understand the speaker's arguments and may detract from their persuasiveness.\n3. Lack of clarity: At times, the speaker's argument is not entirely clear, making it challenging for listeners to follow their line of reasoning. For example, when they say \"et on bonus,\" it is unclear what this statement is intended to convey.\n4. Lack of contextualization: The speaker does not provide any context for their arguments, such as the historical or scientific background of the phenomenon they are discussing. This lack of context can make it difficult for listeners to fully appreciate the significance of the speaker's findings.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some intriguing ideas, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and convincing in order to effectively persuade their audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,28266,15237,29892,301,29915,21708,14954,1173,818,269,29915,17833,533,316,301,29915,711,1557,332,2131,29889,1720,4224,5128,276,454,20491,634,325,25747,661,4350,1750,3911,27666,301,29915,16063,631,634,521,744,332,29889,5334,4047,2535,872,301,29915,1639,786,371,332,29892,8556,1047,4467,9411,818,425,23520,316,5278,301,545,29889,8748,6079,712,872,7199,29948,29882,2673,3031,569,22572,29915,15669,289,7054,29892,980,19947,10440,3058,5246,7814,286,22702,316,301,29915,16063,631,1750,8556,21206,29065,29889,1588,575,302,29915,342,2331,443,3036,346,585,29899,9161,1037,29889,319,13325,29899,23088,20737,3686,388,29948,316,454,274,9498,1465,301,29915,1466,1577,10050,1577,438,1481,1577,10050,1577,8396,29889,4546,29875,1444,325,1759,3686,2747,316,7890,7602,475,1037,29889,951,1374,1690,290,8146,4555,980,707,1139,29892,872,282,1808,29892,425,8774,3068,283,301,29915,16063,457,3686,663,29889,317,681,3158,8774,3068,1387,29892,23563,1775,4894,2993,4191,454,480,1037,3435,15390,553,286,30000,2484,553,1652,30057,6609,316,19703,5289,29889,2726,1652,30057,6609,1750,20423,7848,364,692,267,29892,1224,2123,6701,10767,29884,29889,8748,373,623,1808,7015,1775,4894,2993,29899,27048,29892,11482,1300,29879,29899,3921,29879,29889,4546,29875,432,29915,404,15802,270,29915,25378,966,8774,3068,1608,267,1750,3435,818,301,29915,17234,316,301,29915,2249,2333,316,19703,5289,634,316,7199,9030,3440,2257,1374,1690,290,8146,8164,7848,25179,1893,1318,818,301,29915,7192,2172,29889,8748,373,28920,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,2831,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,22001,4475,304,278,27791,265,310,3578,953,4430,491,3058,17279,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,17953,3277,29889,2266,526,777,2702,3291,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,393,3058,17279,508,20076,3578,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,10225,310,29190,936,10757,3732,372,5189,304,8072,7602,1239,278,13254,310,278,2854,537,310,1009,2980,29889,13,29906,29889,512,3200,9696,6624,3002,29901,450,25657,3913,4958,763,376,12031,3068,283,301,29915,16063,457,3686,663,29908,322,376,1579,30057,6609,316,19703,5289,1699,607,526,451,15574,1304,297,16021,2313,10242,29889,910,508,1207,372,5189,363,11621,414,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,322,1122,1439,1461,515,1009,20408,294,20193,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,451,9186,2821,29892,3907,372,18066,292,363,11621,414,304,1101,1009,1196,310,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,896,1827,376,300,373,28920,1699,372,338,20871,825,445,3229,338,9146,304,27769,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,3030,950,2133,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,3030,363,1009,6273,29892,1316,408,278,15839,470,16021,3239,310,278,27791,265,896,526,5353,292,29889,910,10225,310,3030,508,1207,372,5189,363,11621,414,304,8072,11188,278,26002,310,278,25657,29915,29879,1284,886,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,11158,5526,292,7014,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,17953,3277,297,1797,304,17583,20408,1943,1009,20026,29889],"total_duration":146817479565,"load_duration":393553,"prompt_eval_count":302,"prompt_eval_duration":27997652000,"eval_count":353,"eval_duration":118818813000}
