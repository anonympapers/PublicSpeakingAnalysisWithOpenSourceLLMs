{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T17:52:15.555129687Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker seems to be passionate about their topic and uses humor and anecdotes to engage the audience. However, the argument is not particularly convincing or well-structured, and the speaker's use of hyperbole and exaggeration detracts from the credibility of their claims.\n\nThe speaker's central argument is that a cr√®me des serres chocolat is not just a chocolate dessert, but an art form that requires skill and creativity to craft. While this may be true, the speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or logical reasoning to support their claim. Instead, they rely on vague generalizations and personal anecdotes, which do not convincingly demonstrate the complexity and artistry of the dessert.\n\nFurthermore, the speaker's use of humor and sarcasm can come across as condescending or dismissive to some audience members, potentially undermining their credibility. While humor can be an effective tool in persuasion, it is important to use it judiciously and avoid coming across as disrespectful or arrogant.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's passion and enthusiasm are evident, their argument could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2598,521,300,424,1671,337,2405,2123,13901,15243,1671,286,4600,29889,315,29915,342,1597,1139,712,1444,592,26099,18484,926,1318,29892,634,1444,452,872,275,2331,7890,29892,3503,19601,3711,19211,29892,1444,1998,1671,286,4600,29889,5334,17103,29892,274,29915,342,427,20744,1601,11510,631,29892,1444,767,479,29889,11948,8570,29892,1444,452,767,479,2331,302,29915,326,13732,439,7768,29889,2581,767,479,553,2181,19503,553,724,690,521,542,324,1446,29889,8748,4191,1444,26099,330,473,29885,392,29892,432,29915,29874,603,343,1153,29926,5561,553,3036,346,2993,316,772,381,818,301,29915,524,14508,29889,8748,316,425,29564,29899,29891,818,425,1109,1924,1190,454,6808,375,29889,8748,29202,6701,553,694,275,21158,6282,391,631,29889,315,29915,342,10814,29892,7890,8992,29920,1436,29889,4546,29875,5695,29889,11948,10814,29892,1444,7890,1029,484,29892,7890,4788,29920,592,2970,29892,2739,347,29892,274,29915,342,2298,325,336,2073,1597,2181,5000,553,724,690,782,521,542,324,271,29889,315,29915,342,21617,29884,9201,4280,29872,29889,1720,343,263,9201,270,29915,292,29878,2487,10070,29889,9280,29889,2581,7890,425,1034,311,29889,1551,707,2298,1190,868,619,29948,2958,347,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,7890,8992,29920,18836,29892,443,619,29948,2958,347,818,3691,4170,29892,274,29915,342,2298,4280,29872,439,29915,1540,2181,5000,553,724,690,521,542,324,1446,29889,11948,707,29899,346,712,5278,4280,2131,29892,29871,4277,6267,427,15378,545,29892,274,29915,342,925,882,2257,712,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,818,13310,611,266,17449,29889,360,29915,1654,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,2444,304,367,15935,403,1048,1009,11261,322,3913,27448,322,385,687,29881,4769,304,3033,482,278,20026,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,338,451,10734,17953,3277,470,1532,29899,4984,2955,29892,322,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,322,429,9921,362,1439,1461,29879,515,278,6625,4127,310,1009,16726,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,6555,2980,338,393,263,2181,5000,553,724,690,521,542,324,271,338,451,925,263,521,542,23167,6808,814,29892,541,385,1616,883,393,6858,19911,322,907,28157,304,25554,29889,5806,445,1122,367,1565,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,8669,29892,896,19104,373,25160,2498,17063,322,7333,385,687,29881,4769,29892,607,437,451,17953,3277,368,22222,278,13644,322,1616,6020,310,278,6808,814,29889,13,13,29943,332,721,5514,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,27448,322,269,5666,11625,508,2041,4822,408,2148,9977,2548,470,18918,573,304,777,20026,5144,29892,19998,563,837,2827,1009,6625,4127,29889,5806,27448,508,367,385,11828,5780,297,20408,7002,29892,372,338,4100,304,671,372,6577,1654,5794,322,4772,6421,4822,408,766,690,1103,1319,470,564,9102,424,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,23644,3173,29885,526,13602,29892,1009,2980,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":82862413294,"load_duration":287585,"prompt_eval_count":316,"prompt_eval_duration":37256829000,"eval_count":305,"eval_duration":45604584000}
