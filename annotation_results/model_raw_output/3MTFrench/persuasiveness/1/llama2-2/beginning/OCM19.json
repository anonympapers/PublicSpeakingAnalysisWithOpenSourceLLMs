{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T04:42:03.646743323Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 2 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker is not very convincing in their argument for the benefits of \"énesscence\" (Ulère). They provide no scientific evidence or credible sources to support their claims, and their argument relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and personal opinions. This lack of empirical evidence makes it difficult to persuade the audience of the effectiveness of this alternative approach.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is not rigorous or well-structured. They make claims without providing any logical explanation or evidence to support them, which makes their argument appear weak and unconvincing. For example, they claim that \"she diffuse dans leur environment des molécules qui vont faire en sorte que la sénéistance se propage à tout leur gain,\" but they provide no information on what these molecules are, how they work, or why they would be effective in promoting senescence.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's passion and personal experience with the topic are evident, their argument is not well-supported by evidence or logical reasoning, which limits its persuasiveness and credibility.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,1437,3364,261,2257,29871,29906,29900,6063,634,316,9947,21907,12784,316,4226,29889,8748,8556,22114,11825,29892,8689,7814,11825,29892,4439,28661,22527,29892,427,1098,1690,291,7015,19406,2710,443,7006,1029,4564,2406,29892,13942,29877,4798,316,25226,4439,328,583,29889,8748,8556,9411,29892,6701,304,29875,18916,29899,6500,29892,24145,304,277,18331,29889,838,943,10019,680,29885,358,29892,373,263,9411,8829,347,316,343,343,261,427,289,7293,20877,29948,29892,19397,1791,261,28273,267,29892,19397,2145,2853,818,12278,1875,634,818,2600,1524,24145,11449,454,2298,1472,27761,1950,29889,1720,343,263,553,432,375,1912,818,16474,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,21668,286,4600,868,439,1789,29874,634,1045,533,868,260,29899,1564,533,29889,28079,316,872,6316,29889,838,943,29892,1444,26099,443,367,585,367,585,904,10965,29892,432,29915,328,29885,1691,29892,3503,28185,9373,1223,296,270,29915,264,3209,9073,1035,29880,12973,29889,3872,29883,980,21668,1597,8671,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,11062,8671,29892,4875,1671,8356,6003,381,868,6964,316,269,29915,1690,404,29883,663,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,29965,29880,1908,29889,435,29915,1794,270,30095,316,12866,425,29415,454,269,29915,1690,404,2016,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,29965,29880,1908,29892,1750,6088,439,29915,4999,4625,4370,14060,743,3133,27751,818,553,22884,29892,373,11113,868,6267,18165,634,452,20423,2298,6674,4926,29889,6340,2923,1509,1465,6267,12471,17239,553,6062,29948,21337,1750,325,609,9073,427,29835,712,425,269,25747,9948,409,3107,482,818,5646,6267,11581,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,338,451,1407,17953,3277,297,1009,2980,363,278,23633,310,376,1690,404,29883,663,29908,313,29965,29880,1908,467,2688,3867,694,16021,10757,470,6625,1821,8974,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,322,1009,2980,337,3687,20365,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,26971,29889,910,10225,310,29190,936,10757,3732,372,5189,304,20408,1943,278,20026,310,278,2779,20193,310,445,8671,2948,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,4984,2955,29889,2688,1207,16726,1728,13138,738,16667,8252,470,10757,304,2304,963,29892,607,3732,1009,2980,2615,8062,322,443,535,3845,3277,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,376,11360,2923,1509,1465,6267,5177,553,6062,29948,21337,1750,325,609,9073,427,29835,712,425,269,25747,21558,409,3107,482,818,5646,6267,11581,1699,541,896,3867,694,2472,373,825,1438,13206,21337,526,29892,920,896,664,29892,470,2020,896,723,367,11828,297,2504,11427,6940,9977,663,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,7333,7271,411,278,11261,526,13602,29892,1009,2980,338,451,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,470,16667,24481,29892,607,13071,967,20408,294,20193,322,6625,4127,29889],"total_duration":72437208594,"load_duration":262892,"prompt_eval_count":315,"prompt_eval_duration":33257948000,"eval_count":281,"eval_duration":39178406000}
