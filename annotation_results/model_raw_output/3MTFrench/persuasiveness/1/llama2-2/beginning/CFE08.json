The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices and logic to make their argument convincing.\n\nThe speaker begins by using a clever analogy to grab the audience's attention and establish the premise of the speech: \"Il était une fois les trois petits cochons.\" This sets the tone for the rest of the speech, which is lighthearted and playful while also conveying a serious message.\n\nThe speaker then uses reasoning and evidence to support their argument that coproduits are not just useless parts of an animal, but rather a valuable resource. They provide a statistic that coproduits represent 5% of the weight of a pig, which helps to build credibility and make their case more persuasive.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve their argument. For example, they do not provide any concrete examples or case studies to illustrate the potential benefits of coproduits. Additionally, the speaker's use of hyperbole (\"Bien qu'un peu difficile, Garou ne mange pas l'intégralité de les onles le cochon.\") could be seen as exaggerated and may undermine the credibility of their argument.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas for improvement, the speaker's use of logic, evidence, and rhetorical devices makes their argument persuasive and convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,6303,1597,10098,966,7732,5697,1169,1302,305,787,29889,8748,6079,2123,29875,29892,29871,29906,29900,29896,29929,29892,274,29915,342,425,5273,868,1302,305,265,29889,3872,29883,29892,24145,7732,5697,1169,1302,305,787,29892,274,29915,342,6079,425,1437,29887,2073,1465,301,29915,326,1182,261,29889,751,392,5646,270,29915,348,17103,454,8774,13775,8556,7171,311,29892,6974,29874,634,4332,332,2883,634,373,454,1302,305,265,29892,454,2298,26379,29892,454,2298,15258,634,454,2298,623,1893,654,29889,2581,325,1759,592,6367,18362,2257,10784,15819,29889,315,29915,342,454,3256,992,309,30001,29889,26219,439,29915,348,7006,2923,25123,29892,7455,283,452,767,479,2331,301,29915,524,27083,284,2131,316,966,373,793,454,1302,305,265,29889,8748,425,5582,623,332,381,425,282,681,344,29892,966,373,793,29892,966,633,1144,634,6701,425,17949,29889,478,681,4788,29920,592,2970,10440,439,29915,309,269,29915,342,3984,782,301,870,29875,7209,325,713,311,29889,8748,6079,1661,29892,5646,4191,7890,29892,14954,970,29892,7455,283,452,767,479,712,966,289,787,3036,346,1314,868,1302,305,265,29889,5202,276,358,6309,425,325,713,311,29889,8748,454,18062,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,2298,3817,15471,966,5614,3518,1169,3435,966,7019,1066,339,3794,29889,1019,1173,15243,28313,29892,818,3256,1465,425,22259,2131,29889,1551,269,29915,496,424,712,966,5614,3518,1169,17899,296,29871,29945,29995,868,772,4841,270,29915,348,1302,305,265,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,2831,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,322,5900,304,1207,1009,2980,17953,3277,29889,13,13,1576,25657,16410,491,773,263,23455,3483,6933,304,17229,278,20026,29915,29879,8570,322,10127,278,5188,895,310,278,12032,29901,376,14126,6303,1597,10098,966,7732,5697,1169,1302,305,787,1213,910,6166,278,16225,363,278,1791,310,278,12032,29892,607,338,3578,23057,287,322,1708,1319,1550,884,378,345,5414,263,10676,2643,29889,13,13,1576,25657,769,3913,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,393,5614,3518,1169,526,451,925,19315,5633,310,385,13019,29892,541,3265,263,21114,6503,29889,2688,3867,263,1002,4695,393,5614,3518,1169,2755,29871,29945,29995,310,278,7688,310,263,282,335,29892,607,6911,304,2048,6625,4127,322,1207,1009,1206,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,2980,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,6455,470,1206,11898,304,28475,278,7037,23633,310,5614,3518,1169,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,4852,29933,819,439,29915,348,7006,2923,25123,29892,7455,283,452,767,479,2331,301,29915,524,27083,284,2131,316,966,373,793,454,1302,305,265,23157,1033,367,3595,408,429,9921,630,322,1122,563,837,457,278,6625,4127,310,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,363,20414,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,5900,29892,10757,29892,322,364,9188,272,936,9224,3732,1009,2980,20408,294,573,322,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":152036871992,"load_duration":352018,"prompt_eval_count":297,"prompt_eval_duration":33657040000,"eval_count":321,"eval_duration":118378776000}
