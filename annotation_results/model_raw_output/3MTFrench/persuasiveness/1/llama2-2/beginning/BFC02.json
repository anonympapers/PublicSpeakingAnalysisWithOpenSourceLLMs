{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T16:07:54.598490061Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios to engage the audience and make their message more relatable. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. Lack of clear evidence: While the speaker mentions that they have sent out thousands of mails, they do not provide any concrete evidence to support their claim. Providing specific examples or statistics would help to strengthen their argument.\n2. Unclear motivation: The speaker's motivation for studying discrimination is not clearly articulated. What specifically are they trying to achieve by studying this topic? How does it align with their personal goals or values?\n3. Too much reliance on hypothetical scenarios: While the hypothetical scenarios help to illustrate the point, they also make the argument feel somewhat abstract and difficult to relate to. Providing more concrete examples or data would help to make the argument more compelling.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the reasoning could be improved, the speaker does a good job of presenting their message in a clear and engaging manner.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6298,926,787,712,7890,577,4099,29920,10850,29948,19073,270,29915,348,25479,882,634,712,7890,9982,24135,29920,454,5899,29889,6803,409,9073,29892,7890,27962,1597,22577,2889,10646,1190,8986,29892,610,17488,29892,1190,454,10814,19480,29889,8407,25927,316,13545,16283,29892,7890,2414,13325,7732,611,7545,29892,7732,9667,267,9577,1027,309,7147,1750,452,766,9073,712,610,454,544,1690,290,553,4348,375,29889,3067,23853,347,29892,19748,634,12929,2795,16391,9411,966,7732,26814,25479,882,818,454,16053,29872,1314,29889,478,681,8992,29920,439,29915,30001,18729,29892,980,7890,21668,12866,3060,275,381,2637,7015,7732,4348,375,29889,3872,29883,29892,1444,7890,18593,425,1139,1750,3060,275,24135,29920,7890,1577,3067,23853,347,29892,19748,29892,19601,29899,18202,29889,478,681,3060,275,5582,29920,3479,756,1973,1577,1174,22259,2131,29892,966,7732,611,7545,712,7890,8992,29920,337,24359,3435,285,2993,29889,16932,4625,4370,427,18644,743,610,443,14954,1173,332,29889,7747,14954,1173,332,707,5278,316,7890,16455,643,634,316,1437,18821,261,1354,7890,7175,29888,25138,443,3058,1134,270,29915,513,3640,375,29889,8748,2257,14954,1173,332,707,6079,274,29915,342,19601,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,589,9318,1601,24618,661,2535,443,5900,709,378,24359,1671,443,286,6430,579,424,5025,4170,707,270,29915,264,1365,7598,553,3533,4285,316,611,7545,29889,24804,29899,262,29899,29888,11115,1671,1437,18821,261,1354,12997,8105,882,966,611,7545,1436,2406,904,23853,347,29892,19748,2123,19601,29899,18202,29889,1551,966,521,2925,28374,270,29915,711,841,381,1597,1841,1713,29889,8748,12866,29892,818,301,29915,2987,882,29889,2598,541,29892,7890,454,25179,29948,371,29920,316,7199,275,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,1893,566,631,425,2313,5632,3381,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,13752,300,936,21846,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,393,896,505,2665,714,17202,310,611,2719,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,9133,4821,2702,6455,470,13964,723,1371,304,9324,264,1009,2980,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,17385,362,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,17385,362,363,23382,2313,5632,3381,338,451,9436,1616,293,7964,29889,1724,10816,526,896,1811,304,6176,491,23382,445,11261,29973,1128,947,372,7595,411,1009,7333,14433,470,1819,29973,13,29941,29889,1763,29877,1568,12536,749,373,13752,300,936,21846,29901,5806,278,13752,300,936,21846,1371,304,28475,278,1298,29892,896,884,1207,278,2980,4459,10579,9846,322,5189,304,29279,304,29889,9133,4821,901,18387,6455,470,848,723,1371,304,1207,278,2980,901,752,7807,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,16710,29892,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2643,297,263,2821,322,3033,6751,8214,29889],"total_duration":79331055941,"load_duration":303454,"prompt_eval_count":349,"prompt_eval_duration":40264534000,"eval_count":265,"eval_duration":39065530000}
