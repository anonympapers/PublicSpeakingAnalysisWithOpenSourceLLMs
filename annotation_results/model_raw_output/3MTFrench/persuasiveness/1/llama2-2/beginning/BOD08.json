The speaker presents a clear and concise message, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker mentions that the society Valorrec is developing tubes for exploiting a petroleum reserve in France, but they do not provide any specific details or evidence to support this claim. This lack of supporting information makes it difficult to fully understand the speaker's argument and assess its validity.\n\nSecondly, the speaker uses an analogy about being a tide to explain how the hydrogene avoids fragilization, but this analogy is not clearly linked to the main point of the speech. While the analogy may be helpful in illustrating the concept of fragilization, it does not provide a clear explanation of why the hydrogene is important for exploiting the petroleum reserve.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear message, there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make the speech more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,853,2432,309,293,2488,29892,782,301,11078,1318,29892,301,29915,26555,29888,5340,585,447,794,1661,14344,316,3581,1765,316,1667,6056,267,1841,16349,553,282,1893,12154,1295,2078,29920,7545,29889,2664,3965,30000,793,29892,715,449,1849,818,425,3067,10936,316,5739,347,29892,432,29915,1794,875,355,29884,610,1358,316,425,19513,2630,272,3757,29892,1750,6303,9953,424,316,13942,29877,2496,553,23131,267,1671,16035,1524,5278,1841,16349,29889,341,10204,265,479,480,29875,3794,427,3444,29231,453,424,2535,425,6701,19513,1190,1597,25698,2249,15819,1027,4233,533,29889,365,29915,26555,29899,3712,311,553,23131,267,427,1223,631,1671,16035,7018,282,1893,307,492,1908,782,6299,316,425,2778,29889,365,29915,397,29948,29888,1387,10019,568,425,13855,309,4371,610,301,29915,29882,2941,9102,8146,29889,6803,7199,9030,29892,480,573,29920,29899,4346,29875,402,11341,26814,10754,29892,286,30000,29894,787,29892,14034,29920,712,7890,29871,22730,3964,423,311,29892,980,21668,623,6092,282,1893,381,818,425,6701,21206,1808,270,29915,1893,737,1750,966,263,6454,915,553,4441,29887,22702,29889,317,6223,29920,29899,433,10754,29889,9353,5278,544,1355,344,29892,373,707,427,3700,818,443,610,29877,347,270,29915,465,631,29889,4546,29875,29892,402,29990,29954,425,3669,600,5793,2535,553,19507,12628,29889,6803,363,2265,301,29915,29882,2941,9102,8146,818,443,22917,270,29915,9864,13241,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2643,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,12459,2630,272,3757,338,14338,23131,267,363,16035,11407,263,5697,12154,398,23986,297,3444,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,4902,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,910,10225,310,20382,2472,3732,372,5189,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,322,24809,967,2854,537,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,3913,385,3483,6933,1048,1641,263,260,680,304,5649,920,278,27246,9102,1600,4772,29879,13855,309,2133,29892,541,445,3483,6933,338,451,9436,9024,304,278,1667,1298,310,278,12032,29889,5806,278,3483,6933,1122,367,8444,297,8632,1218,278,6964,310,13855,309,2133,29892,372,947,451,3867,263,2821,8252,310,2020,278,27246,9102,1600,338,4100,363,16035,11407,278,5697,12154,398,23986,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,2643,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,278,12032,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":52986581310,"load_duration":274537,"prompt_eval_count":280,"prompt_eval_duration":23424361000,"eval_count":244,"eval_duration":29561366000}
