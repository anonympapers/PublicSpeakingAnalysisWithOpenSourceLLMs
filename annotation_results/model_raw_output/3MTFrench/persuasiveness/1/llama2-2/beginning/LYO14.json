{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T15:24:39.419343494Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and repetition to emphasize their points, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker begins by asking the audience if they have ever considered starting their own business, which immediately grabs the audience's attention and makes them think about their own entrepreneurial aspirations. However, the speaker's claim that they are the only sociologist in France studying entrepreneurial failures is not entirely accurate, as there are other researchers in the field who have also studied this topic.\n\nThe speaker then goes on to explain how entrepreneurial failures represent 1.7% of the French stock of enterprises, which is a significant proportion. However, they do not provide any concrete evidence or data to support this claim, which could have made their argument more persuasive.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of the term \"croque mort\" (dead horse) to describe entrepreneurs who are no longer viable is a bit simplistic and does not take into account the complex reasons why entrepreneurs fail. It would have been more effective to provide a more nuanced analysis of the various factors that contribute to entrepreneurial failure, such as lack of funding, poor marketing, or unexpected changes in the market.\n\nOverall, while the speaker uses some effective rhetorical devices and raises an important issue, their reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by data to make their argument more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,13325,29899,23088,20737,10420,29948,818,9484,261,26814,2637,7734,634,316,15470,23440,1600,332,29973,1174,5246,29892,1444,7890,18593,425,1139,610,346,712,274,29915,342,454,3209,1671,2298,270,29915,262,10662,1190,29871,29941,29889,8748,364,30037,13325,316,9484,261,1487,2637,7734,316,425,9073,9364,276,29892,316,425,9073,4595,381,29889,8748,6079,373,427,2123,2204,347,712,274,29915,342,2637,7734,29892,7006,29442,12416,29889,8748,18916,7890,7890,270,3246,29892,14333,29871,4277,29892,29871,4277,5246,443,7006,8182,802,5758,29889,8748,6079,29892,818,11482,1300,270,29915,5474,454,8182,802,5758,29892,432,29915,1794,301,29915,267,19428,316,23949,29889,8748,1444,26099,425,25642,1465,425,5374,5458,11076,29892,818,2852,566,631,966,5246,267,270,29915,14056,7734,29889,2726,23440,4637,1750,302,29915,609,2298,25235,270,29915,23641,1671,282,2747,6267,2114,545,29892,6267,269,2883,533,634,10713,2411,30069,1372,29889,1174,3444,29892,2257,1374,1690,290,8146,12450,2016,427,28504,29871,29896,29892,29955,29995,316,24145,10961,270,29915,14056,7734,29889,8748,274,29915,342,782,9434,17507,316,24346,712,29871,4277,409,21714,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,16170,2016,332,325,993,29892,1597,10098,712,966,23440,4637,4625,5246,5246,267,29889,29871,29941,27829,7719,1190,25022,941,13929,29892,7848,301,29915,21871,24969,29892,7848,2654,1253,29948,29892,2123,7848,12507,345,17161,29948,29889,8748,6079,1601,18848,316,5374,1189,434,1136,2488,818,4224,441,29875,7808,301,29915,24031,316,425,10329,28123,6577,11477,533,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,21159,654,304,19310,675,1009,3291,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,16410,491,6721,278,20026,565,896,505,3926,5545,6257,1009,1914,5381,29892,607,7389,2646,5824,278,20026,29915,29879,8570,322,3732,963,1348,1048,1009,1914,23440,1600,332,616,7051,381,800,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,896,526,278,871,5374,19915,297,3444,23382,23440,1600,332,616,4418,1973,338,451,9186,16232,29892,408,727,526,916,5925,414,297,278,1746,1058,505,884,12399,445,11261,29889,13,13,1576,25657,769,5771,373,304,5649,920,23440,1600,332,616,4418,1973,2755,29871,29896,29889,29955,29995,310,278,5176,10961,310,3896,558,4637,29892,607,338,263,7282,18618,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,445,5995,29892,607,1033,505,1754,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,278,1840,376,24077,802,5758,29908,313,311,328,10435,29897,304,8453,23440,1600,1295,1058,526,694,5520,3516,519,338,263,2586,5466,4695,322,947,451,2125,964,3633,278,4280,9590,2020,23440,1600,1295,4418,29889,739,723,505,1063,901,11828,304,3867,263,901,4948,8362,7418,310,278,5164,13879,393,29126,304,23440,1600,332,616,10672,29892,1316,408,10225,310,5220,292,29892,6460,9999,292,29892,470,15668,3620,297,278,9999,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3913,777,11828,364,9188,272,936,9224,322,1153,4637,385,4100,2228,29892,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,848,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":149438219003,"load_duration":305987,"prompt_eval_count":303,"prompt_eval_duration":26470026000,"eval_count":355,"eval_duration":122967280000}
