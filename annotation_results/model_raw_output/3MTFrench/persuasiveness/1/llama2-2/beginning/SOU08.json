The speaker presents their findings in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their argument more convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could provide more context about the significance of the discovery of pre-estourian layers at different times in the grottos. While they mention that two pre-estourian peoples lived in the same area at different times, they do not explain why this is significant or how it relates to the broader historical context. Providing more background information and context would help to make their argument more persuasive.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could provide more detailed explanations of their methodology and the evidence they have used to support their conclusions. While they mention that they have used dataction methods to give an age precise to the indices archiologiques, they do not explain how these methods work or what specific evidence they have used to support their conclusions. Providing more detail about their methodology and evidence would help to establish their credibility and make their argument more persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their findings in a clear and concise manner, there are areas where they could improve to make their argument more convincing and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,853,3190,29875,1189,434,18475,6967,2298,818,14954,454,784,29885,29892,2257,1750,263,1597,330,8146,818,10920,29889,315,29915,342,443,1437,371,312,361,1750,16374,6896,2736,276,1597,22085,9061,4555,966,285,15322,3435,29057,5059,2406,980,343,263,553,3533,4285,270,29915,812,2406,29889,8748,1671,29871,4277,29892,2331,3008,28230,316,1701,30037,793,29892,1601,18848,707,270,29915,4422,7608,553,8774,386,2631,316,848,428,18934,316,27516,443,19406,479,7175,3476,818,553,16285,3190,29875,1189,3783,16413,1934,270,29915,1540,20244,316,12584,1924,29889,6803,3479,8632,2406,409,10252,296,29892,10252,296,818,443,3256,427,29871,29946,1750,24108,782,6218,868,1766,542,29889,2664,3190,29875,1189,1041,4625,4224,23048,553,26379,316,7175,342,15508,1912,29889,1720,343,427,343,12584,453,424,29892,11797,343,4625,24889,29948,553,274,3222,267,316,269,519,1750,263,29476,12031,553,288,29872,9351,634,553,4047,30000,1912,409,11062,453,2406,29889,1174,966,2852,4749,1934,818,425,301,6648,29892,966,3190,29875,1189,1041,4625,7199,275,712,4239,7006,2701,358,7175,342,15508,1912,316,286,30069,4977,2930,10491,4625,2299,2131,7015,4071,2167,818,553,19462,12694,1237,29889,8748,1671,7199,9030,1671,339,7768,980,343,263,11878,12694,1237,454,3209,29899,29873,29915,1466,1465,7015,4071,2167,29892,980,21668,4048,6390,18097,2257,1874,882,263,11878,13003,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,1444,3060,15773,966,16285,818,1418,29948,29889,2581,452,1236,1314,2331,544,30037,280,369,966,288,29872,9351,29892,9201,16784,13805,29892,1559,966,8774,386,2631,316,848,428,712,432,29915,4422,895,3435,17912,440,743,427,325,17016,4158,562,690,427,18520,29889,838,943,712,23532,29899,9161,29973,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,1284,886,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,3030,1048,278,26002,310,278,20699,310,758,29899,342,283,6392,15359,472,1422,3064,297,278,4071,698,359,29889,5806,896,3585,393,1023,758,29899,342,283,6392,1236,459,793,10600,297,278,1021,4038,472,1422,3064,29892,896,437,451,5649,2020,445,338,7282,470,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,2545,1664,15839,3030,29889,9133,4821,901,3239,2472,322,3030,723,1371,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,13173,7309,800,310,1009,1158,3002,322,278,10757,896,505,1304,304,2304,1009,21204,1080,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,505,1304,848,428,3519,304,2367,385,5046,18378,304,278,16285,3190,29875,1189,3783,29892,896,437,451,5649,920,1438,3519,664,470,825,2702,10757,896,505,1304,304,2304,1009,21204,1080,29889,9133,4821,901,9493,1048,1009,1158,3002,322,10757,723,1371,304,10127,1009,6625,4127,322,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,1284,886,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":66818375214,"load_duration":277206,"prompt_eval_count":339,"prompt_eval_duration":28860403000,"eval_count":292,"eval_duration":37957280000}
