{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T12:57:52.495479308Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and emotional appeals to make their point about the power dynamics between men and women in society. However, the reasoning behind their argument is not always rigorous, and there are some logical fallacies present in the speech.\n\nFor example, the speaker claims that \"the woman adultère ou forniquatrice who pourrait engendrer des enfants il est gétime voir plus si à finité\" (emphasis added), which implies that a woman who commits adultery or fornication could potentially have children that are not biologically related to her husband. However, this statement is not supported by any evidence and is likely based on a faulty assumption about the mechanics of human reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument relies heavily on emotional appeals and rhetorical questions, which can be effective in persuading an audience but do not necessarily demonstrate a rigorous understanding of the topic at hand. For example, when the speaker asks \"Vous l'acconnissez cette chance on a l'insochant? Almeur appellement sujetes\" (emphasis added), they are using emotional language to emphasize the gravity of the situation, but this does not necessarily prove their point about the power dynamics between men and women.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's argument is persuasive in some respects, it is not without its flaws. A more rigorous analysis of the topic would be necessary to demonstrate a fully convincing case.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,610,2257,18308,316,868,19397,5898,966,26809,553,5445,267,29889,478,681,301,29915,562,13082,5582,29920,5278,8825,373,263,301,29915,262,578,13775,29973,838,1004,332,16794,944,29140,267,29889,9353,5278,8825,29892,301,29915,26029,2131,5646,875,5289,25810,263,431,4926,610,2257,1750,409,21714,5898,966,3623,407,553,5445,267,29889,8748,18729,13417,277,966,286,30037,4467,818,553,1970,583,29889,8748,6079,2537,2853,1249,7890,439,29915,309,343,263,12471,29871,29953,29900,29900,6063,1465,454,1528,20030,316,3444,29889,7747,1750,409,21714,5898,966,3623,407,553,5445,267,29892,16703,294,29892,553,432,29915,294,5695,21394,29889,1174,22259,2131,29892,432,29915,1794,28643,13659,2637,454,14913,26883,262,634,454,17268,818,425,1436,868,4546,11771,29871,30212,479,29889,8748,1444,325,1759,7890,1601,509,261,439,29915,4999,3435,7015,13659,29879,29889,28720,17488,29892,454,3209,868,14913,26883,262,29892,29140,868,17268,29889,1459,17488,29892,425,15096,16157,1908,2123,363,1240,339,17417,1750,1671,8356,3033,355,2872,553,21038,980,707,330,1893,603,8689,2298,1354,818,1436,2131,29889,26079,9397,17488,29892,443,7006,2298,4280,29872,29889,405,681,992,1654,443,8727,276,427,29871,29896,29947,29929,29946,29889,315,3100,712,2453,329,343,282,26283,1597,15096,15182,1318,1750,953,1129,347,10741,3348,568,1295,29889,1394,29892,427,8694,29892,301,29915,355,434,274,29915,342,3348,568,332,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,23023,1848,5929,1338,304,1207,1009,1298,1048,278,3081,19753,1546,1757,322,5866,297,12459,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,5742,1009,2980,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,322,727,526,777,16667,285,9864,2478,2198,297,278,12032,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,16726,393,376,1552,6114,16157,1908,2123,363,1240,339,17417,1058,1671,8356,3033,355,2872,553,21038,980,707,330,1893,603,8689,2298,1354,818,1436,2131,29908,313,7278,25101,2715,511,607,10469,393,263,6114,1058,25741,594,352,22005,470,363,7823,362,1033,19998,505,4344,393,526,451,4768,1189,1711,4475,304,902,10216,29889,2398,29892,445,3229,338,451,6969,491,738,10757,322,338,5517,2729,373,263,12570,29891,11833,1048,278,7208,1199,310,5199,9483,428,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,364,9188,272,936,5155,29892,607,508,367,11828,297,20408,9382,385,20026,541,437,451,12695,22222,263,12912,20657,8004,310,278,11261,472,1361,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,278,25657,19514,376,29963,681,301,29915,562,13082,5582,29920,5278,8825,373,263,301,29915,262,578,13775,29973,838,1004,332,16794,944,29140,267,29908,313,7278,25101,2715,511,896,526,773,23023,1848,4086,304,19310,675,278,20953,310,278,6434,29892,541,445,947,451,12695,6356,1009,1298,1048,278,3081,19753,1546,1757,322,5866,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,20408,294,573,297,777,3390,29879,29892,372,338,451,1728,967,17422,5652,29889,319,901,12912,20657,7418,310,278,11261,723,367,5181,304,22222,263,8072,17953,3277,1206,29889],"total_duration":231820622659,"load_duration":316596,"prompt_eval_count":282,"prompt_eval_duration":35530267000,"eval_count":354,"eval_duration":196289207000}
