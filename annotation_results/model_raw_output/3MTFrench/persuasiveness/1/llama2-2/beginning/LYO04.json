The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning, but there are also some areas where the argumentation could be strengthened.\n\nThe speaker starts by expressing their happiness to be speaking in front of the audience, which sets a positive tone for the rest of the speech. However, the introduction of the topic (\"Enfin, je le serai encore plus de mains, parce que demain, je ne paris en vacances. L'Oin.\") is somewhat confusing and doesn't provide a clear reason why the speaker is addressing the audience.\n\nThe speaker then launches into their main argument, which is that the use of composite materials in aircraft can reduce their environmental impact. They provide some technical details about the properties of these materials and how they can be used to make planes lighter and more efficient. However, the argument could be strengthened by providing more evidence and examples to support the claim. For instance, the speaker could have mentioned specific studies or reports that demonstrate the effectiveness of composite materials in reducing emissions.\n\nAnother area where the argumentation could be improved is the use of logical fallacies. The speaker uses the term \"audure\" which is not a real word and seems to be made-up, which can undermine their credibility. Additionally, the speaker's assertion that composite materials are \"un remodelable\" (unremoulables) is not accurate, as these materials can be recycled or repurposed after their initial use.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments and reasoning, there are areas where the argumentation could be strengthened to make the speech more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,26099,2793,270,29915,5474,29871,1654,19398,7890,29889,1174,4951,29892,1444,454,724,1794,10440,2298,316,1667,29879,29892,610,346,712,1261,475,29892,1444,452,610,275,427,11757,2925,29889,365,29915,29949,262,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,8556,1047,4467,316,2298,427,2298,10426,29889,405,681,24684,787,2923,25123,358,8556,27962,316,7015,22683,267,1045,30058,2167,11510,284,492,1912,29892,966,1029,1080,29889,11044,388,787,8532,439,29915,2719,8608,10978,2298,316,18554,634,316,1841,700,533,6267,10879,12471,17239,284,29889,997,1650,29892,425,10918,1908,29899,6772,29889,390,3451,4620,1318,23563,5541,1934,427,1223,631,610,553,1775,4894,2993,5541,3246,14924,316,966,7697,267,9291,29915,30001,29871,29945,29900,29995,2298,966,330,29889,1704,301,29915,9509,358,5882,316,7015,5541,3246,29892,274,29915,342,868,715,579,1387,29889,853,24324,261,29892,1597,24286,10329,28123,316,6062,29948,21337,2893,3783,29889,9353,1601,2280,29892,980,707,316,425,6635,2445,7661,553,1840,267,12990,332,455,1849,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,439,29915,309,1411,20752,610,1841,2467,20674,1387,18097,373,454,521,585,17615,634,1597,10098,3984,427,13618,29892,980,452,8164,2331,7848,1083,27224,29948,29889,2598,1840,267,12990,545,29892,443,13185,454,325,442,545,633,7293,29899,284,545,29889,951,20067,818,3829,29892,980,263,1597,289,7293,16160,2131,316,301,29915,29882,30069,29886,2410,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,4653,292,1009,22722,304,367,13590,297,4565,310,278,20026,29892,607,6166,263,6374,16225,363,278,1791,310,278,12032,29889,2398,29892,278,18707,310,278,11261,4852,2369,4951,29892,1444,454,724,1794,10440,2298,316,1667,29879,29892,610,346,712,1261,475,29892,1444,452,610,275,427,11757,2925,29889,365,29915,29949,262,23157,338,10579,16051,322,1838,29915,29873,3867,263,2821,2769,2020,278,25657,338,3211,292,278,20026,29889,13,13,1576,25657,769,6826,267,964,1009,1667,2980,29892,607,338,393,278,671,310,20842,17279,297,15780,508,10032,1009,29380,10879,29889,2688,3867,777,16905,4902,1048,278,4426,310,1438,17279,322,920,896,508,367,1304,304,1207,3814,267,301,14643,322,901,8543,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,10757,322,6455,304,2304,278,5995,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,1033,505,5276,2702,11898,470,13676,393,22222,278,2779,20193,310,20842,17279,297,27668,953,6847,29889,13,13,2744,1228,4038,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,16710,338,278,671,310,16667,285,9864,2478,29889,450,25657,3913,278,1840,376,15052,545,29908,607,338,451,263,1855,1734,322,2444,304,367,1754,29899,786,29892,607,508,563,837,457,1009,6625,4127,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,20842,17279,526,376,348,1083,27224,519,29908,313,348,1745,5059,1849,29897,338,451,16232,29892,408,1438,17279,508,367,1162,11078,839,470,1634,332,4752,1156,1009,2847,671,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,304,1207,278,12032,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":154030161197,"load_duration":239399,"prompt_eval_count":282,"prompt_eval_duration":25241131000,"eval_count":380,"eval_duration":128787631000}
