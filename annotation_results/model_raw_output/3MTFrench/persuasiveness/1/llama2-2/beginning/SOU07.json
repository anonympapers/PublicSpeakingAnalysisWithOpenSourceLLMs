The speaker does present some reasonable arguments and examples to support their claim that too much colestery in the blood can cause vascular problems, but there are some areas where they could improve.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more evidence from scientific studies or experts in the field to strengthen their argument. While they mention that doctors can detect the molecule of colestery in the blood, they could have provided more details on how this is done and what specific tests are used to measure colestery levels. This would have given their argument more credibility and made it harder for listeners to dispute their claims.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or objections to their argument. For example, some listeners may argue that there are other factors that can contribute to vascular problems, such as smoking, lack of exercise, or a poor diet. The speaker could have acknowledged these points and explained how colestery levels can interact with other factors to increase the risk of vascular problems.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments, they could have done more to make their case more persuasive and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,425,12320,316,425,330,374,4798,634,553,364,2017,29889,2661,29899,346,439,29915,309,343,263,553,26943,443,364,2017,634,1465,425,269,3498,29973,21597,818,19601,29889,438,1481,29892,2123,29875,29892,2123,29875,29889,315,29915,14386,2331,868,285,389,309,316,25497,276,818,5278,1139,29889,1551,17043,13871,9411,966,25828,30069,4467,270,29915,264,364,2017,29889,405,29915,29874,301,29915,1540,295,1750,3581,280,427,626,744,818,425,17949,29889,8748,373,409,2665,2331,9577,427,13618,29889,4241,841,424,29892,14034,29920,712,7890,8992,29920,9201,316,784,342,1908,1465,454,13625,29889,1954,22094,29920,29889,315,29915,342,2331,10019,1693,29889,1551,452,8164,2331,325,336,2073,4048,6390,29889,1720,21668,16454,8689,443,8774,3068,1004,9073,316,260,267,13625,550,29889,365,30001,29892,1465,24145,13625,29892,454,8774,3068,1004,8164,1437,371,312,261,425,6062,29948,1810,371,316,784,342,1908,29889,8748,8556,2970,29892,818,8570,29892,7890,427,8992,29920,9201,29889,478,681,5161,24661,553,3669,3476,19638,2993,325,6151,1070,267,29889,6101,3477,488,316,19397,1437,371,312,261,553,6062,29948,21337,805,4582,361,3783,1465,24145,13625,29892,1437,5365,575,29452,332,29892,1750,8556,1399,1387,425,29845,2123,301,29915,370,1150,29948,270,29915,1540,4439,328,347,29889,29871,30219,29874,14924,270,29915,21412,24145,4464,316,6316,29892,316,23532,553,10283,293,20060,29889,1551,302,29915,29874,2331,1671,14984,966,4439,328,583,29889,1459,17488,29892,425,11482,1654,663,18715,13498,29892,22572,29915,15669,1671,425,1437,695,264,749,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,15590,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,393,2086,1568,784,342,708,297,278,10416,508,4556,325,6151,1070,4828,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,515,16021,11898,470,2902,1372,297,278,1746,304,9324,264,1009,2980,29889,5806,896,3585,393,437,14359,508,6459,278,13206,29883,1297,310,784,342,708,297,278,10416,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,4902,373,920,445,338,2309,322,825,2702,6987,526,1304,304,5645,784,342,708,11174,29889,910,723,505,2183,1009,2980,901,6625,4127,322,1754,372,22622,363,11621,414,304,28447,1009,16726,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,704,24247,304,1009,2980,29889,1152,1342,29892,777,11621,414,1122,27754,393,727,526,916,13879,393,508,29126,304,325,6151,1070,4828,29892,1316,408,1560,17223,29892,10225,310,15058,29892,470,263,6460,652,300,29889,450,25657,1033,505,24084,3192,1438,3291,322,10824,920,784,342,708,11174,508,16254,411,916,13879,304,7910,278,12045,310,325,6151,1070,4828,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,896,1033,505,2309,901,304,1207,1009,1206,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":62106860306,"load_duration":280180,"prompt_eval_count":313,"prompt_eval_duration":26396142000,"eval_count":287,"eval_duration":35709868000}
