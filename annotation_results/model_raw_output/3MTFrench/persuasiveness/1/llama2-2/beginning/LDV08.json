{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T13:09:21.122991258Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does provide some useful information about the importance of microbiota in the intestines and how it can be affected by a lack of balance. However, there are some areas where the speech could be improved to make it more convincing:\n\n1. Lack of clarity: At times, the speaker's message gets lost in unnecessary tangents or unclear statements. For example, the sentence \"Eh bien, ce sont toutes les MicroBiot intestinales et tout à mon baccadierie que l'on possède dans nos intestinales\" is difficult to follow and does not add much clarity to the overall message.\n2. Lack of evidence: While the speaker mentions that the microbiota is composed of billions of beneficial bacteria, there is no concrete evidence provided to support this claim. Adding scientific studies or expert opinions could help strengthen the argument.\n3. Overuse of jargon: The speaker uses technical terms like \"microBiot intestinal\" and \"baccadierie,\" which may be unfamiliar to some listeners. Using simpler language and providing explanations for these terms could make the speech more accessible to a wider audience.\n4. Lack of emotional appeal: The speaker does not use emotional appeals or personal stories to engage the audience. Adding anecdotes or emotional appeals could help make the message more relatable and memorable.\n\nOverall, while the speech provides some useful information about microbiota, it could be improved by addressing these areas of weakness.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,578,381,29892,1444,286,29915,932,1808,6953,457,382,617,1943,634,782,10212,20141,4883,5321,20608,1041,286,29915,932,1808,28330,383,4582,744,29889,8748,2257,29627,29892,1444,325,1759,7890,610,1358,316,20140,20517,327,938,342,979,29889,478,681,4788,29920,592,1261,3825,2257,439,29915,342,2257,2245,2594,1646,29889,382,29882,6079,29892,2257,3435,14984,966,20140,20517,327,938,342,979,267,634,5646,818,1601,289,5753,328,631,347,712,301,29915,265,3119,14785,1465,7814,938,342,979,267,29889,7747,9200,20517,327,938,342,979,707,5695,16794,29948,6953,938,342,979,29889,3872,29883,7890,8992,29920,20737,269,30095,276,358,875,355,29884,610,1358,2535,5278,2529,1671,966,6128,782,316,7869,29879,29892,1750,4079,316,425,6316,316,5278,15096,443,325,17016,10814,354,332,29889,10793,6953,938,342,979,707,5541,1318,316,3533,29875,3163,316,289,627,4745,289,25747,29888,3783,1671,24145,14913,29889,16314,424,12471,29871,29906,4679,359,316,24145,772,277,3001,29892,7209,4875,29892,9301,316,4697,29539,23563,3778,1934,2123,6079,316,409,11482,9030,8474,966,8774,305,1934,316,289,627,4745,29889,11948,29871,29906,6063,427,8714,29892,274,29915,342,425,6635,579,1336,354,634,443,9982,21871,15943,276,7035,782,2757,316,14984,7015,289,24729,289,627,4745,29889,8748,18916,29892,1120,424,7890,2970,712,425,15096,29892,782,270,29915,485,296,369,29892,707,452,269,29915,18288,2298,760,449,1465,1487,4497,265,29889,6340,707,28185,9373,274,3222,29948,1190,1487,508,481,29948,2535,316,289,24729,2181,19503,270,29915,342,18902,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,5407,2472,1048,278,13500,310,9200,5365,4616,297,278,938,342,1475,322,920,372,508,367,15201,491,263,10225,310,17346,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,4947,5714,297,19039,18806,1237,470,20871,9506,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,10541,376,29923,29882,6079,29892,2257,3435,14984,966,20140,20517,327,938,342,979,267,634,5646,818,1601,289,5753,328,631,347,712,301,29915,265,3119,14785,1465,7814,938,342,979,267,29908,338,5189,304,1101,322,947,451,788,1568,7542,537,304,278,12463,2643,29889,13,29906,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,393,278,9200,5365,4616,338,13725,310,11118,1080,310,7795,5611,289,5761,423,29892,727,338,694,18387,10757,4944,304,2304,445,5995,29889,18804,16021,11898,470,17924,26971,1033,1371,9324,264,278,2980,29889,13,29941,29889,6811,1509,310,432,1191,265,29901,450,25657,3913,16905,4958,763,376,29885,2357,20517,327,938,342,979,29908,322,376,29890,5753,328,631,347,1699,607,1122,367,443,8302,4447,304,777,11621,414,29889,5293,13682,4086,322,13138,7309,800,363,1438,4958,1033,1207,278,12032,901,15579,304,263,25734,20026,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,23023,1848,25530,29901,450,25657,947,451,671,23023,1848,5929,1338,470,7333,15874,304,3033,482,278,20026,29889,18804,385,687,29881,4769,470,23023,1848,5929,1338,1033,1371,1207,278,2643,901,1104,17219,322,26959,519,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,8128,777,5407,2472,1048,9200,5365,4616,29892,372,1033,367,16710,491,3211,292,1438,10161,310,8062,2264,29889],"total_duration":267102168675,"load_duration":374501,"prompt_eval_count":315,"prompt_eval_duration":45995587000,"eval_count":365,"eval_duration":221105516000}
