{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T14:55:59.420023774Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and hyperbole to emphasize their points and create a sense of urgency, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by using humor to engage the audience, which is an effective way to build rapport and establish credibility. However, the argument becomes less persuasive as it goes on, as the speaker relies too heavily on anecdotal evidence and emotional appeals rather than logical reasoning and data.\n\nFor example, the speaker claims that certain people receive more information because their nerves are \"a little bit decriped,\" but they provide no evidence to support this claim. Similarly, the argument that diabetes is caused by too much sugar in the blood, which diffuses throughout the body and leads to nerve damage, is oversimplified and not supported by scientific evidence.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of hyperbole, such as comparing a person's foot to a \"caillot,\" can be seen as overly dramatic and may undermine the credibility of their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some skill in using rhetorical devices to engage the audience, the lack of logical reasoning and evidence reduces the persuasiveness of their argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,592,5814,5893,818,7890,2257,29627,29892,1444,592,26099,16987,782,3184,29871,29941,29900,6063,29889,435,29915,326,1004,553,5969,787,29889,435,29915,326,1004,443,301,1132,631,29889,7747,3435,966,26033,5847,1465,425,282,30069,311,286,6430,631,29892,1750,263,427,18644,29948,454,2643,316,425,4662,20519,9291,29915,30001,1601,5147,345,585,29889,8748,7890,29892,966,3440,454,15373,30085,29892,980,263,7006,270,545,29889,7747,3435,966,26033,5847,1465,425,282,30069,311,325,359,285,15322,1750,7890,454,766,296,29889,12390,26033,5847,3435,4191,553,8955,9230,316,350,22192,8050,1750,8556,1871,424,9410,663,316,2257,1750,409,21714,26269,316,8556,29889,341,514,276,22527,29892,3058,267,18554,8556,2414,794,2298,301,29915,19678,29889,951,332,26033,5847,3435,443,7006,1437,699,29886,1169,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,452,4131,493,29891,29889,1720,20423,11469,443,5777,453,327,1465,425,521,11214,545,634,452,6701,2331,427,1083,609,16731,29889,997,4556,316,7015,452,4131,493,29891,29892,454,652,370,12973,29892,5646,409,480,1037,1465,454,13625,1750,2923,1509,1465,454,14913,9291,29915,30001,425,282,30069,311,29892,1559,336,3503,301,29915,29882,1478,333,403,818,17887,301,29915,29948,1089,345,29889,8748,7015,18554,1750,4625,868,652,370,12973,29889,8748,1597,6032,9474,4625,427,2298,6079,18484,443,318,280,29899,29879,1908,29892,1597,2174,347,2600,13469,1465,425,282,30069,311,1750,452,269,29915,29891,439,986,296,818,534,625,2331,6079,29889,1551,452,872,277,2331,1671,339,7768,29889,8748,1354,373,452,26939,2331,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,11266,833,280,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,1653,263,4060,310,5065,14703,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,773,27448,304,3033,482,278,20026,29892,607,338,385,11828,982,304,2048,13659,322,10127,6625,4127,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,7415,3109,20408,294,573,408,372,5771,373,29892,408,278,25657,337,3687,2086,20365,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,23023,1848,5929,1338,3265,1135,16667,24481,322,848,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,16726,393,3058,2305,7150,901,2472,1363,1009,302,20098,526,376,29874,2217,2586,316,699,9795,1699,541,896,3867,694,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,20175,29892,278,2980,393,652,370,10778,338,8581,491,2086,1568,26438,297,278,10416,29892,607,2923,6394,10106,278,3573,322,11981,304,302,7143,18658,29892,338,288,874,13699,2164,322,451,6969,491,16021,10757,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,29892,1316,408,17420,263,2022,29915,29879,3661,304,263,376,1113,453,327,1699,508,367,3595,408,975,368,8541,2454,322,1122,563,837,457,278,6625,4127,310,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,19911,297,773,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,3033,482,278,20026,29892,278,10225,310,16667,24481,322,10757,26830,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2980,29889],"total_duration":139073501573,"load_duration":303642,"prompt_eval_count":320,"prompt_eval_duration":29003461000,"eval_count":307,"eval_duration":110069078000}
