{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T00:48:24.626819608Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker provides some valid points and counterarguments to the common advice to choose a career based on passion, but their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that choosing a career based solely on passion may not lead to long-term happiness or success, but they do not provide any empirical evidence or concrete examples to support their claims. For instance, they mention that the garbage collector is often in better health than the general population, but they do not explain why this might be the case or whether there are any broader implications for career choice.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument could benefit from more nuance and consideration of alternative perspectives. For example, they could acknowledge that passion may play a role in job satisfaction and well-being, even if it is not the only factor. They could also address potential criticisms of their viewpoint, such as the possibility that people who are passionate about their work may be more likely to experience burnout or stress.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some interesting points, their argument could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and consideration of multiple perspectives.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,712,7890,28078,11867,7890,9073,2298,11364,29892,1597,1139,13483,1671,11172,439,29915,265,2174,802,29892,712,301,29915,265,263,5646,269,29915,296,355,29884,782,11387,1597,10098,1671,270,29915,348,472,276,12491,29889,19551,802,432,29915,28899,275,2298,17222,29892,1671,286,29915,29874,1241,818,25497,276,818,5278,1139,29892,373,5178,1924,18484,316,3060,275,381,443,11510,631,712,432,29915,264,29878,30037,793,29892,712,18729,378,2974,1249,611,20877,29948,29889,6101,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,9201,427,5644,262,316,325,359,1437,1859,583,6351,29876,4999,712,432,29915,1794,2653,9073,9291,29915,30001,16474,29892,980,3031,569,1841,637,424,712,2257,27923,302,29915,29874,2002,993,2331,818,5646,427,521,562,348,29889,8748,712,301,29915,27419,316,1487,11510,631,452,17512,1875,1249,2331,427,12563,23563,8714,872,20877,29948,29889,28720,17488,29892,454,9982,351,5606,1810,371,332,18484,15935,5483,610,10713,875,307,1169,29892,11797,3435,13149,6311,427,26713,20877,29948,712,425,1841,2170,818,4665,29889,16932,285,2017,11387,29892,11797,289,692,296,2298,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,11797,269,13365,296,1841,2445,6311,439,29915,2719,577,993,2298,564,3780,267,712,270,29915,28619,3058,267,2224,11763,29889,365,29915,296,336,2073,29892,966,301,29915,23578,30069,4467,302,29915,609,316,2257,439,29915,309,343,263,29889,2726,508,22543,1274,6947,2658,1750,260,9373,12694,1237,3038,2540,316,24145,13625,15422,743,818,8556,11482,9030,8474,966,24424,29892,966,270,627,29948,2722,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,8128,777,2854,3291,322,6795,25699,304,278,3619,9848,304,6755,263,6413,2729,373,15935,29892,541,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,1576,25657,24084,2710,393,23906,263,6413,2729,14419,368,373,15935,1122,451,3275,304,1472,29899,8489,22722,470,2551,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,470,18387,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,3585,393,278,25861,6314,272,338,4049,297,2253,9045,1135,278,2498,4665,29892,541,896,437,451,5649,2020,445,1795,367,278,1206,470,3692,727,526,738,2545,1664,2411,5795,363,6413,7348,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,14169,515,901,4948,749,322,19220,310,8671,3736,1103,3145,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,18145,5485,393,15935,1122,1708,263,6297,297,4982,26470,322,1532,29899,915,292,29892,1584,565,372,338,451,278,871,7329,29889,2688,1033,884,3211,7037,11164,12903,310,1009,1776,3149,29892,1316,408,278,13331,393,2305,1058,526,15935,403,1048,1009,664,1122,367,901,5517,304,7271,12138,449,470,22884,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,8031,3291,29892,1009,2980,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,19220,310,2999,3736,1103,3145,29889],"total_duration":59396436820,"load_duration":190771,"prompt_eval_count":301,"prompt_eval_duration":25344917000,"eval_count":274,"eval_duration":34050846000}
