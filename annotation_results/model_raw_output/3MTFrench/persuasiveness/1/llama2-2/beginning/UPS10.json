The speaker does a decent job of crafting a convincing message and presenting their argument in a clear and concise manner. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claim that the mousse around us is beneficial for our skin. While they mention that it's \"magnifique,\" they don't provide any scientific backing to explain why it's good for our skin. Some studies or research findings could have strengthened their argument and made it more persuasive.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or criticisms of their idea. For example, they could have acknowledged that some people may find the idea of touching mousse around them to be unappealing or even disgusting. By addressing these concerns and providing a clear explanation for why their approach is effective, the speaker could have made their message more persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does a good job of presenting their argument, there are areas where they could have been more rigorous in their reasoning and provided more evidence to support their claim.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,4613,381,261,443,4595,17103,634,980,285,10877,966,26809,634,14034,29920,29899,23088,13545,1473,267,1465,443,3856,29899,29885,21167,424,29889,10016,10098,712,7890,343,29871,22730,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,19612,12416,4662,13561,966,26809,634,4880,261,966,8227,793,316,4048,424,712,7890,8992,29920,26269,316,7890,29889,11001,267,3435,9119,361,3783,3503,20554,3435,5695,1601,29140,316,266,17449,634,2257,712,1444,16623,2535,29892,1444,7890,9667,1759,316,301,29915,4548,1064,2073,261,2535,19601,29889,9353,443,7017,8714,29892,8556,599,787,8556,872,275,381,270,29915,348,7006,316,425,286,681,344,712,8556,1029,787,9411,16134,424,26269,316,8556,634,2535,5278,286,681,344,29889,405,681,599,787,7787,517,7598,454,907,1314,316,24145,772,647,1318,29889,6101,373,1072,19755,5278,1095,12154,332,29892,427,5246,29892,274,29915,342,1597,10640,9577,4662,346,316,24145,14913,634,18097,373,707,304,29875,29892,5278,10640,2535,425,286,681,344,29892,373,409,7697,16731,439,29915,585,439,29915,309,452,289,30095,280,1597,18062,1035,307,11555,29889,838,943,18916,29892,274,29915,342,24145,8861,1518,4894,663,29889,1105,4099,29920,443,7006,2298,12584,29892,16623,787,553,521,15806,2025,6311,28374,29889,10793,10098,29899,455,544,264,787,10440,443,7006,316,286,681,344,29892,3503,7787,517,29891,787,454,25927,316,24145,17103,29889,29871,30219,29874,29892,274,29915,342,1597,10640,12694,2016,634,1671,339,7768,29973,1459,346,439,29915,1808,707,2298,1072,434,1509,29889,2664,12912,359,7719,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,274,29915,342,29889,7747,3435,316,22577,1045,1173,1190,26814,1236,585,634,2298,966,1045,6609,409,7697,13830,29892,2298,425,12912,359,2131,18475,7268,16933,4595,270,29915,1808,5695,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,263,27189,4982,310,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,292,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,286,681,344,2820,502,338,7795,5611,363,1749,19309,29889,5806,896,3585,393,372,29915,29879,376,29885,4211,22781,1699,896,1016,29915,29873,3867,738,16021,27436,304,5649,2020,372,29915,29879,1781,363,1749,19309,29889,3834,11898,470,5925,1284,886,1033,505,9324,6419,1009,2980,322,1754,372,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,11164,12903,310,1009,2969,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,24084,3192,393,777,2305,1122,1284,278,2969,310,6023,292,286,681,344,2820,963,304,367,443,29065,12818,470,1584,766,29887,504,292,29889,2648,3211,292,1438,21838,322,13138,263,2821,8252,363,2020,1009,2948,338,11828,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1754,1009,2643,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,505,1063,901,12912,20657,297,1009,24481,322,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,29889],"total_duration":82891158082,"load_duration":222886,"prompt_eval_count":347,"prompt_eval_duration":40789669000,"eval_count":282,"eval_duration":42100664000}
