The speaker presents some valid concerns about the potential dangers of climate change and the importance of transitioning to renewable energy sources. However, their message could be more convincing if they provided more detailed and substantiated evidence to support their claims.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is not particularly rigorous, as they rely on generalizations and emotive language rather than specific data and scientific research to make their point. For example, they claim that the \"pollution, the climate change, the exhaustion of fossil energies\" are \"art,\" but do not provide any concrete examples or studies to back up this assertion.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's call to action is vague and unspecific. They encourage the audience to \"continue to manifest\" and \"advance research,\" but do not offer any concrete steps or strategies for how to achieve these goals.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some important points about the need to address climate change and transition to renewable energy sources, their message could be more persuasive with more detailed evidence and a clearer call to action.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,13325,29899,23088,20737,844,3977,29948,818,7175,862,261,325,359,659,4637,1671,439,5171,425,18249,634,818,966,4771,5969,743,11482,2344,19882,1190,425,3814,12973,16053,479,29889,16852,29892,274,29915,342,325,17016,29889,405,681,1047,4467,9411,7175,16770,743,610,425,6003,381,29892,24145,24571,12675,707,2298,24502,29948,818,443,29550,329,29892,3503,302,29915,29874,274,29915,342,2331,425,21180,918,29892,454,1841,305,28411,882,10784,15819,29892,301,29915,29948,25628,882,553,904,1089,29887,583,21983,5475,29889,315,29915,342,1616,1738,315,29915,342,1616,1738,315,29915,342,856,966,297,6578,1893,8192,1190,425,6003,381,316,425,18249,3435,7209,270,2663,925,6832,743,29892,3503,856,3440,1841,351,381,29889,8748,6079,29892,6079,269,30095,29878,29892,439,29915,265,8164,15237,2145,2853,818,409,715,9030,634,818,14682,4156,7209,25179,492,29892,8474,425,10974,378,7214,782,19119,9332,1318,29892,2123,9073,1029,25856,425,23520,1671,8019,818,302,29915,3496,381,26713,29892,1750,269,29915,932,29884,993,1190,553,904,1089,29887,583,410,4569,29892,269,29915,1300,424,4547,275,424,316,2298,427,2298,316,5722,11763,904,1089,29887,583,4325,9095,1849,1465,24145,14931,29899,29888,1249,904,1089,29887,19971,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,21838,1048,278,7037,270,13873,310,23622,1735,322,278,13500,310,9558,292,304,23011,519,5864,8974,29889,2398,29892,1009,2643,1033,367,901,17953,3277,565,896,4944,901,13173,322,5960,3656,630,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,10734,12912,20657,29892,408,896,19104,373,2498,17063,322,23023,573,4086,3265,1135,2702,848,322,16021,5925,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,278,376,29886,3028,918,29892,278,23622,1735,29892,278,27096,291,310,21983,309,18190,583,29908,526,376,442,1699,541,437,451,3867,738,18387,6455,470,11898,304,1250,701,445,28306,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,1246,304,3158,338,25160,322,443,14940,29889,2688,13731,6617,278,20026,304,376,19878,304,10419,29908,322,376,17263,749,5925,1699,541,437,451,5957,738,18387,6576,470,16650,583,363,920,304,6176,1438,14433,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,4100,3291,1048,278,817,304,3211,23622,1735,322,9558,304,23011,519,5864,8974,29892,1009,2643,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,411,901,13173,10757,322,263,26135,1246,304,3158,29889],"total_duration":52030792779,"load_duration":296342,"prompt_eval_count":249,"prompt_eval_duration":20783465000,"eval_count":255,"eval_duration":31246483000}
