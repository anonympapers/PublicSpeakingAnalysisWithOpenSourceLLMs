{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T14:45:41.995907266Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 on the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning, but there are also some areas where the argumentation could be improved.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that it presents a clear and specific problem (the poor quality of the forgeron's work) and proposes a solution (using machines specifically designed for fine work). The speaker also uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"foisse Ã  ton d'orghumant\") to emphasize their point.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the argumentation could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker does not provide any evidence or data to support their claims about the quality of the forgeron's work or the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Additionally, the speaker's use of language is sometimes unclear or ambiguous (e.g., \"malse\" and \"colleague\"), which can make it difficult to follow their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speech presents some persuasive arguments, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based support.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,6303,1597,10098,1465,443,696,20030,658,262,29892,443,534,2488,363,914,265,1750,24304,27275,29892,443,3058,29889,7747,13137,29899,23088,427,20744,6303,6079,3710,300,568,29892,980,452,610,854,6096,2331,1597,289,7293,4021,2131,29889,28079,267,966,2930,17893,439,29915,309,363,479,10978,29892,325,895,29892,1559,301,29915,2521,29892,427,867,265,482,29892,6303,5646,2143,375,29948,634,302,29915,275,29899,30001,29899,29880,29915,348,553,21090,29889,315,29915,14386,1487,270,2663,425,2258,1082,25235,17402,29889,10016,904,941,412,23309,1750,409,5246,427,626,609,29892,454,11510,284,1750,363,479,1249,19154,286,1435,29892,274,29915,342,5321,30000,13000,29892,3477,488,29889,1763,29875,992,309,30001,427,289,11992,1318,29892,5246,12866,16794,818,8556,1750,263,1029,898,553,14884,18142,1512,944,544,5903,375,1671,553,1518,4894,2063,1436,267,29889,1174,1243,424,427,266,290,1893,284,29892,5291,1671,3417,269,29915,331,2139,1080,10814,3709,15243,878,15340,29892,301,29915,29948,386,4582,8819,362,29889,28532,5582,818,15243,270,29915,990,16063,424,29892,454,363,914,265,409,11529,29892,634,5146,29874,782,19590,5162,29892,966,6987,29892,734,503,1943,29920,439,7768,29889,11948,454,363,914,265,6309,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,16710,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,372,22981,263,2821,322,2702,1108,313,1552,6460,11029,310,278,363,914,265,29915,29879,664,29897,322,9551,267,263,1650,313,4746,14884,10816,8688,363,2691,664,467,450,25657,884,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,4852,1181,5582,818,15243,270,29915,990,16063,424,1159,304,19310,675,1009,1298,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,11029,310,278,363,914,265,29915,29879,664,470,278,2779,20193,310,278,7972,1650,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,338,6041,20871,470,22363,681,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,29885,1435,29908,322,376,1054,280,3437,4968,607,508,1207,372,5189,304,1101,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,22981,777,20408,294,573,6273,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,2304,29889],"total_duration":61239784244,"load_duration":203538,"prompt_eval_count":249,"prompt_eval_duration":26210695000,"eval_count":252,"eval_duration":35028256000}
