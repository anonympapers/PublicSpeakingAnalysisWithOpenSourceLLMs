{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T04:46:40.640441464Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker makes some valid points about the stereotypes associated with international students and the challenges they face in adapting to a new environment. However, the speech could have been more persuasive if the speaker had provided more concrete examples or data to support their claims. Additionally, the speaker's tone could have been more confident and assertive, rather than sounding somewhat defensive and apologetic.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker provides some insightful observations about the acculturation process and the challenges faced by international students. However, the speech could have benefited from more rigorous reasoning and analysis. For example, the speaker could have explored the cultural differences that lead to stereotypes and how they can be overcome. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the research topic to make their argument more compelling.\n\nOverall, while the speaker makes some valid points, the speech could have been more persuasive and rigorously reasoned if they had provided more concrete examples and data, and if they had taken a more confident and assertive tone.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,751,392,1444,26427,3479,18554,316,1601,875,283,6617,29892,3440,4875,409,12450,2016,443,2852,4749,424,6121,29892,432,29915,711,29873,993,15237,425,6701,1841,1713,29889,315,29915,342,443,17222,2594,283,316,332,29889,349,801,1738,1174,5246,11364,29892,443,2852,4749,424,7006,2437,11521,1465,3999,22299,29889,5462,316,380,10651,29899,29873,29899,309,7890,452,16391,29920,2331,1577,435,29915,264,872,275,21907,12784,29889,2581,16623,1601,11619,271,1465,454,25915,270,29915,1540,1302,459,10500,2637,425,3444,634,454,7400,29889,7747,1750,5246,316,19601,29892,1597,2852,566,12361,20110,29889,29871,30219,29874,286,29915,29874,3635,275,316,12036,261,712,589,9318,7015,4558,634,316,301,29915,496,1308,276,782,2393,29948,29892,373,2123,2204,347,29202,818,301,29915,29654,9639,424,316,3999,2852,4749,1934,29889,365,29915,1893,566,12361,20110,29892,29871,4277,263,10042,5646,7594,339,29915,348,1750,16374,269,29915,21412,634,269,29915,1175,5402,443,12471,17239,439,29915,309,734,1841,29880,4564,1309,29884,29889,9353,425,23520,29892,15093,263,5143,882,634,15093,28206,3435,818,7006,966,9580,2093,1190,270,29915,5753,499,2633,29889,8748,274,29915,342,925,882,454,18165,17239,316,2257,8774,3068,6386,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,1465,454,25915,316,611,266,17449,29889,1174,10684,29892,454,1889,375,270,29915,5753,499,2633,707,17899,29948,5898,425,13618,270,29915,1540,1302,459,427,3765,29899,29894,29889,751,29875,409,8556,10503,993,818,443,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,3732,777,2854,3291,1048,278,269,12358,327,7384,6942,411,6121,8041,322,278,18066,267,896,3700,297,7744,292,304,263,716,5177,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,1033,505,1063,901,20408,294,573,565,278,25657,750,4944,901,18387,6455,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,1033,505,1063,901,24332,322,4974,573,29892,3265,1135,6047,292,10579,822,6270,322,27746,7492,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,8128,777,25483,1319,13917,1048,278,1035,499,2633,1889,322,278,18066,267,20050,491,6121,8041,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,1033,505,7795,1573,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,7418,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,3902,4395,278,16375,12651,393,3275,304,269,12358,327,7384,322,920,896,508,367,25688,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,5925,11261,304,1207,1009,2980,901,752,7807,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3732,777,2854,3291,29892,278,12032,1033,505,1063,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,272,5794,2769,287,565,896,750,4944,901,18387,6455,322,848,29892,322,565,896,750,4586,263,901,24332,322,4974,573,16225,29889],"total_duration":69066260034,"load_duration":257473,"prompt_eval_count":293,"prompt_eval_duration":30731067000,"eval_count":278,"eval_duration":38334198000}
