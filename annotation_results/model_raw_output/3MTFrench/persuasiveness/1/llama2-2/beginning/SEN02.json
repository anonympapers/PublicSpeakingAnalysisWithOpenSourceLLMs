{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T01:51:43.252121683Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker makes some convincing arguments, such as the importance of choosing the best presentation and the potential consequences of not doing so. However, their argument that \"supprim√© tous les autres concurrents\" is not particularly persuasive, as it does not provide any evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim.\n2. Rigor of reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is generally sound, but there are some areas where they could improve. For example, their argument that the police will use datings chimiques to determine if the statute of limitations has passed is not entirely accurate, as these methods can be imprecise and subject to errors. Additionally, the speaker's assertion that \"nous sommes tout ce qui fait rends\" (we are everything that makes us) is not a particularly convincing argument, as it does not provide any evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim.\n\nOverall, while the speaker makes some persuasive arguments, there are areas where their reasoning could be improved to make their message more compelling and convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,2257,439,29915,265,7890,26427,29892,274,29915,342,316,3060,275,381,425,15378,545,5814,9233,29889,6803,712,2257,12852,19601,29892,1444,29758,4239,3987,29889,12852,818,9073,425,15378,545,5814,9233,29892,12852,1462,5632,29948,9411,966,10890,3022,1038,1237,29889,8748,610,4771,29892,316,7015,610,5444,17334,3440,1041,634,13545,29899,6948,7848,297,6578,28141,610,425,15426,29892,980,9378,277,316,6079,439,29915,30001,14255,454,14913,634,270,29915,1131,9030,454,1437,11818,316,2225,699,1980,29889,997,2225,3395,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,425,2635,316,26535,661,311,29899,29890,291,270,29915,314,814,545,29889,26383,454,8714,29892,966,758,29884,1960,480,267,409,1437,5105,296,1354,6079,818,443,3209,7175,794,424,29892,20554,452,3435,2298,2414,29894,1849,19398,443,9434,17507,29889,3872,29883,29892,21714,29920,553,301,30000,1960,29892,1444,26099,22024,339,1924,29889,306,455,7594,339,29915,348,16391,454,14913,10042,29892,29871,4277,409,752,9854,443,7006,29892,3503,1444,286,29915,262,6578,12973,2331,9201,29889,997,10974,2181,8332,295,2947,427,20744,2635,553,3966,744,698,267,29889,6803,4048,6390,1354,454,1437,11818,316,2225,699,1980,707,1209,29948,2123,1661,29892,3503,1444,17043,275,6267,8774,386,356,29892,274,29915,342,553,1418,800,20674,3783,634,20554,767,16011,316,16784,2459,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,373,707,5646,2257,1750,5246,364,1975,29889,8748,425,15259,316,7814,359,722,347,14864,24145,7916,29872,29892,24145,19406,479,29892,2123,10440,7814,4760,8192,20196,7147,29892,1136,21871,2063,29889,8407,29899,802,29892,7814,6316,7545,2684,882,316,425,6701,26722,29889,8748,966,13930,1295,316,1418,800,3435,29202,316,10741,270,466,13116,270,29915,812,2406,29889,8748,274,29915,342,925,882,29871,4277,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,3732,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,1316,408,278,13500,310,23906,278,1900,24329,322,278,7037,27721,310,451,2599,577,29889,2398,29892,1009,2980,393,376,19303,5632,29948,9411,966,10890,3022,1038,1237,29908,338,451,10734,20408,294,573,29892,408,372,947,451,3867,738,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,445,5995,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,6892,6047,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,2980,393,278,10974,674,671,1418,886,20674,3783,304,8161,565,278,1002,1082,310,27028,756,4502,338,451,9186,16232,29892,408,1438,3519,508,367,527,17990,895,322,4967,304,4436,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,376,29876,681,1047,4467,5646,2257,1750,5246,364,1975,29908,313,705,526,4129,393,3732,502,29897,338,451,263,10734,17953,3277,2980,29892,408,372,947,451,3867,738,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,445,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3732,777,20408,294,573,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,16710,304,1207,1009,2643,901,752,7807,322,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":63225741351,"load_duration":260922,"prompt_eval_count":355,"prompt_eval_duration":30083740000,"eval_count":270,"eval_duration":33141152000}
