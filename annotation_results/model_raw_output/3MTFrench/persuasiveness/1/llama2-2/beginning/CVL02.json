{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T08:25:50.883558406Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker is attempting to convince the audience that there is a secret war between humans, animals, insects, birds, and plants against a common enemy known as \"Hasite.\" While the speaker's passion and urgency are evident throughout the speech, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's argument that \"Les vert par Hasite sont partout et sont de toute taille\" (translated to \"There are Hasite creatures of all sizes everywhere\") is not supported by any evidence. The speaker simply asserts this without providing any examples or data to back it up. A more convincing argument would be to provide specific instances or studies that demonstrate the presence and prevalence of Hasite creatures.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's claim that \"Ché Lombe, une personne sur deux est infestée ou a été infestée\" (translated to \"Ché Lombe, almost everyone is infested or has been infested\") is not supported by any evidence. Again, the speaker simply asserts this without providing any data or statistics to back it up. A more convincing argument would be to provide concrete examples of infestations or studies that demonstrate the prevalence of Hasite creatures among the population.\n\nFinally, the speaker's call to action at the end of the speech (\"Alors, je peux pas m'occuper de tous les par Hasite qui existent. Que faites-vous?\" translates to \"So what are you going to do about it?\") is somewhat vague and lacks specificity. A more convincing call to action would be to provide clear and actionable steps that the audience can take to address the issue of Hasite creatures.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's passion and urgency are evident in the speech, the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,28266,425,26245,270,29915,1893,355,29892,980,19947,1597,12573,409,9084,1750,263,20737,5246,553,14746,316,5758,29879,29889,435,29915,1794,19601,29899,18202,639,700,23563,752,4211,787,634,7209,270,2663,712,7890,5695,29892,1444,282,1947,13214,3479,29026,7446,10376,1750,325,4244,993,1465,425,285,10877,818,21384,316,14255,4883,11825,29892,18097,432,29915,28899,275,2298,17222,634,1750,302,29915,29874,4439,28661,22527,2331,10503,4582,29884,29889,9353,5278,12573,29892,8556,1029,787,443,18926,3817,29892,8556,29892,966,3165,2708,29892,3503,8648,966,3778,2993,1750,577,993,27386,690,2123,1766,1144,2535,966,17564,267,29892,966,288,895,2993,634,6701,966,17751,1893,2993,29889,10793,427,15344,275,3817,29892,274,29915,342,454,4837,610,11699,568,29889,2664,4837,610,11699,568,3435,760,449,634,3435,316,12563,260,8284,29889,18410,2708,3435,9200,21785,3783,634,9364,296,1465,454,899,634,18729,3435,9577,6079,1671,301,29915,21813,17239,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,270,29915,14559,3435,9577,8774,305,1934,634,610,11699,568,439,294,2073,14984,966,5152,17893,9364,3794,1190,5278,3814,12973,29889,678,29948,365,290,915,29892,1597,26744,1190,4239,707,3041,342,1318,2123,263,4370,3041,342,1318,29889,3872,29883,29892,1072,19755,29920,26814,29758,262,29892,26814,26003,29892,1072,19755,29920,26814,29758,262,29892,26814,29262,29889,6101,274,29915,342,2331,7890,29892,274,29915,342,26814,29758,262,1750,707,3041,342,1318,29889,838,943,29892,1444,1236,1314,2331,286,29915,542,4979,546,316,9411,966,610,11699,568,1750,1863,296,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,15661,304,7602,1239,278,20026,393,727,338,263,7035,1370,1546,25618,29892,15006,29892,17564,29879,29892,17952,29892,322,18577,2750,263,3619,11103,2998,408,376,14510,568,1213,5806,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,5065,14703,526,13602,10106,278,12032,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,376,24560,4837,610,11699,568,3435,760,449,634,3435,316,12563,260,8284,29908,313,3286,29880,630,304,376,8439,526,11699,568,907,3698,310,599,15786,16978,1159,338,451,6969,491,738,10757,29889,450,25657,3763,408,643,1372,445,1728,13138,738,6455,470,848,304,1250,372,701,29889,319,901,17953,3277,2980,723,367,304,3867,2702,8871,470,11898,393,22222,278,10122,322,758,791,663,310,11699,568,907,3698,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,376,1451,29948,365,290,915,29892,1597,26744,1190,4239,707,3041,342,1318,2123,263,4370,3041,342,1318,29908,313,3286,29880,630,304,376,1451,29948,365,290,915,29892,4359,14332,338,3041,2868,470,756,1063,3041,2868,1159,338,451,6969,491,738,10757,29889,11454,29892,278,25657,3763,408,643,1372,445,1728,13138,738,848,470,13964,304,1250,372,701,29889,319,901,17953,3277,2980,723,367,304,3867,18387,6455,310,3041,342,800,470,11898,393,22222,278,758,791,663,310,11699,568,907,3698,4249,278,4665,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,1246,304,3158,472,278,1095,310,278,12032,4852,2499,943,29892,1444,1236,1314,2331,286,29915,542,4979,546,316,9411,966,610,11699,568,1750,1863,296,29889,5462,5246,267,29899,23088,3026,5578,1078,304,376,6295,825,526,366,2675,304,437,1048,372,29973,1159,338,10579,25160,322,425,4684,2702,537,29889,319,901,17953,3277,1246,304,3158,723,367,304,3867,2821,322,3158,519,6576,393,278,20026,508,2125,304,3211,278,2228,310,11699,568,907,3698,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,5065,14703,526,13602,297,278,12032,29892,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,10757,29889],"total_duration":84434930625,"load_duration":250646,"prompt_eval_count":308,"prompt_eval_duration":28103194000,"eval_count":442,"eval_duration":56330929000}
