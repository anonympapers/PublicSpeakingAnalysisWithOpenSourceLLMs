{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-25T00:53:20.827759687Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give the speech a score of 4 out of 5 on the persuasiveness scale. The speaker does an effective job of crafting a convincing message and presenting their argument in a clear and organized manner. They use vivid imagery and personal anecdotes to make their points more relatable and engaging for the audience.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker's claim that \"la vie est comme le taro\" (life is like a tarot card) is an interesting metaphor, but it is not fully developed or explained. A more detailed explanation of how this metaphor applies to their argument would make their reasoning more convincing.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's statement that \"je suis ce qui se freine\" (I am what slows down life) could be further clarified. What specifically are they referring to? How does their personal experience of feeling like they are holding back life relate to the broader message they are trying to convey? Providing more context and detail would help to strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does an effective job of presenting their argument in a persuasive manner, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and detailed.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8407,5321,15532,29892,20737,29892,1444,12278,1759,553,521,15806,289,15356,690,29889,2726,26943,1750,1700,10978,589,9318,19601,634,19601,1750,1700,10978,26269,5695,4191,443,288,895,585,29889,11948,610,385,29892,19601,29892,633,392,3409,29948,18097,432,29915,879,275,7732,6063,29889,2581,302,29915,1794,18413,6664,434,611,21428,29889,2581,452,1236,1314,2331,282,2747,454,6788,29889,315,29915,342,611,3006,311,439,29915,309,5246,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,452,26099,14931,29899,29886,585,311,5646,14255,7594,339,29915,348,29889,315,29915,342,427,1601,509,424,443,904,10936,29892,1224,29871,29896,29947,6063,29892,712,432,29915,1794,5246,611,8861,12033,1230,316,23921,2247,29889,435,29915,879,275,766,29875,316,9577,694,381,29889,2581,2665,1759,9411,966,18025,29892,966,3581,280,1295,29892,6674,1593,610,286,1924,29889,315,29915,14386,4029,11710,29889,2581,302,29915,1794,18413,2062,275,316,9201,6079,29889,997,12784,1750,592,1702,13871,2779,19882,23428,927,634,4555,1444,452,592,3669,1403,575,2331,29892,274,29915,342,2637,454,3256,6722,1444,286,29915,264,270,943,14255,19601,1465,611,11179,1030,29889,8748,454,3256,6722,1444,592,1841,345,1924,1465,425,269,3498,270,29915,10718,944,29889,438,1481,29892,1444,325,1759,5153,9030,29889,11948,443,8694,29892,1444,302,29915,465,23469,2331,712,5153,9030,29889,2581,1083,609,17016,29889,2581,26099,2257,1750,409,3005,457,29889,997,6316,29892,274,29915,342,4191,454,260,8854,29889,1720,343,263,966,521,2925,19449,1750,4625,1597,1667,5644,457,270,29915,271,283,29889,360,2093,301,29915,28661,29892,1444,592,26099,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,278,12032,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,6287,29889,450,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,292,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,19098,8214,29889,2688,671,325,3640,6382,708,322,7333,385,687,29881,4769,304,1207,1009,3291,901,1104,17219,322,3033,6751,363,278,20026,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,376,433,6316,707,4191,454,260,8854,29908,313,19264,338,763,263,9913,327,5881,29897,338,385,8031,1539,481,2015,29892,541,372,338,451,8072,8906,470,10824,29889,319,901,13173,8252,310,920,445,1539,481,2015,16058,304,1009,2980,723,1207,1009,24481,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,3229,393,376,1324,26099,2257,1750,409,3005,457,29908,313,29902,626,825,5232,29879,1623,2834,29897,1033,367,4340,7542,2164,29889,1724,10816,526,896,16811,304,29973,1128,947,1009,7333,7271,310,11223,763,896,526,13587,1250,2834,29279,304,278,2545,1664,2643,896,526,1811,304,27769,29973,9133,4821,901,3030,322,9493,723,1371,304,9324,264,278,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,297,263,20408,294,573,8214,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,13173,29889],"total_duration":61756898455,"load_duration":273196,"prompt_eval_count":318,"prompt_eval_duration":26777593000,"eval_count":283,"eval_duration":34978510000}
