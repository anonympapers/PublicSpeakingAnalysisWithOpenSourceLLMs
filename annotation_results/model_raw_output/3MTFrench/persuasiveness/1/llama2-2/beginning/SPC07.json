The speaker presents some interesting and unusual ideas about stars, but their reasoning is not always rigorous or well-supported.\n\nThe speaker introduces the topic by mentioning a quote from \"the little prince\" and then shares their personal experience of believing that stars are made up of gas and are extremely hot and bright. However, they do not provide any scientific evidence or explanations to support their claims, which makes it difficult to evaluate their reasoning.\n\nThe speaker also uses an interesting analogy about the sounds emitted by stars, comparing them to a rumble that cannot reach Earth due to the vastness of space. While this is an interesting idea, it is not clear how it relates to the main topic of the speech.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's ideas are creative and thought-provoking, they could benefit from more rigorous analysis and evidence-based reasoning to be considered highly persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,28079,267,7015,904,517,5475,18916,29892,4875,409,260,17449,29889,12603,263,10939,304,29875,553,904,517,5475,1750,269,29915,485,4336,296,29889,10793,16549,23428,927,29892,274,29915,342,454,17887,15927,316,4107,29899,1252,786,4745,1750,592,301,29915,29874,3669,600,12898,980,343,263,6079,553,8595,29889,4546,29875,29892,4875,707,2331,712,432,29915,1794,7618,316,1411,4191,9073,712,966,904,517,5475,7446,1564,453,296,634,16134,424,29892,1444,1236,1314,7890,454,544,8885,29889,438,431,4926,425,16380,280,316,20491,29889,10016,904,517,488,29892,274,29915,342,1597,16380,280,316,12642,29892,17541,19553,882,10329,566,316,9577,946,2131,634,12866,9577,1506,453,1647,29889,2726,14746,316,5697,1169,18025,3435,953,29885,743,818,425,7101,553,904,517,5475,818,18402,14426,29889,1720,269,29915,328,654,484,1671,1436,6311,4642,4191,443,364,533,29889,3872,29883,432,29915,879,275,18836,29892,966,904,517,5475,364,2247,1465,454,24850,29889,11948,12278,787,782,29899,6144,30001,868,364,30037,345,270,29915,23578,1934,29889,16579,802,364,533,1437,14081,316,425,15259,634,316,425,260,8284,316,18402,904,517,488,634,14924,12866,316,9577,6079,966,1559,16027,7608,29889,11948,8992,29920,29899,23088,20737,875,355,29884,1597,904,517,488,1577,10050,29892,1559,454,364,533,302,29915,1131,25404,18413,425,18249,29892,818,4556,316,5646,454,18900,712,454,1487,452,8164,2331,1020,369,643,29889,997,19703,5289,427,337,3703,1173,21714,782,13310,634,610,29894,993,9291,29915,30001,8556,29892,8532,992,1654,425,1139,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,313,2111,261,2486,9034,29884,294,573,29897,363,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,322,22910,7014,1048,10819,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,1576,25657,4547,778,278,11261,491,3585,292,263,14978,515,376,1552,2217,15927,29908,322,769,29358,1009,7333,7271,310,1339,15387,393,10819,526,1754,701,310,10489,322,526,14154,7375,322,11785,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,16021,10757,470,7309,800,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,3732,372,5189,304,14707,1009,24481,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,3913,385,8031,3483,6933,1048,278,10083,953,4430,491,10819,29892,17420,963,304,263,364,15563,393,2609,6159,11563,2861,304,278,13426,2264,310,2913,29889,5806,445,338,385,8031,2969,29892,372,338,451,2821,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,1667,11261,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,7014,526,907,1230,322,2714,29899,16123,17223,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,7418,322,10757,29899,6707,24481,304,367,5545,10712,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":53982895718,"load_duration":259225,"prompt_eval_count":311,"prompt_eval_duration":26077559000,"eval_count":226,"eval_duration":27904520000}
