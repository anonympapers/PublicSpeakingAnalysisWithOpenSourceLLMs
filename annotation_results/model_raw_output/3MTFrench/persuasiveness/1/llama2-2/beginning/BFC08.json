The speaker presents some interesting points about the use of canaries in coal mines and how they were used as an early warning system for toxic gas emissions. However, the speech could benefit from more clarity and structure.\n\nThe speaker jumps between different topics without providing a clear narrative or logical flow of ideas. For example, the transition from the use of canaries in coal mines to the mining of donnie is not smooth, and it's not entirely clear what the speaker is trying to convey. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make it difficult for the listener to follow the speaker's train of thought.\n\nWhile the speaker does provide some interesting facts and insights, they could benefit from more organization and clarity in their presentation. With some revisions to improve the flow and structure of the speech, I believe the speaker could be more persuasive and effective in conveying their message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8407,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29892,980,6303,1424,29948,16011,316,5663,8885,443,508,1306,782,6299,270,29915,6727,335,1372,316,1373,6718,29889,438,1481,29892,432,29915,1794,6309,6079,443,508,1306,29889,10043,1671,626,1792,966,1375,2361,2535,3999,521,550,787,29892,3503,28185,9373,1671,966,410,6772,914,8474,1597,964,27375,362,29889,1174,5246,29892,1014,277,29899,29873,29899,309,3479,3479,26943,634,534,743,787,29899,455,7586,3479,904,29885,6847,553,12642,304,29916,3783,29892,9301,818,1437,371,312,261,1671,966,6063,29889,951,508,1306,269,29915,342,1147,29875,12866,4191,443,714,309,868,1437,29467,16784,1071,553,270,549,743,29889,5345,29948,911,707,1465,454,6701,378,29149,712,301,29915,1062,13857,7903,332,29892,269,4987,439,29915,309,269,29915,23121,2331,270,29915,1540,7903,316,1373,6718,29892,3503,270,29915,1540,7903,316,1016,2786,29889,8748,1601,17889,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,1062,29878,1908,316,425,17043,9948,818,8019,316,7015,14735,743,29892,373,3667,895,427,553,13698,29892,553,21082,19069,28119,29892,18934,316,9484,261,553,508,1306,4610,29884,4999,1671,544,566,381,425,11482,8837,868,21423,634,8288,3367,1875,10042,6267,7132,654,29889,341,13533,316,1016,2786,707,301,29915,14056,7734,274,6119,29892,1750,707,1597,2930,331,1004,2601,1318,1465,454,4662,29916,634,23662,15826,1465,425,18187,362,553,2930,17893,3345,12213,316,14857,16784,2459,29889,365,29915,370,271,29892,1444,6427,8284,2535,301,29915,24031,553,15001,1379,29892,13214,12255,29892,301,29915,29882,943,29886,787,519,25413,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,3291,1048,278,671,310,508,4314,297,17148,29086,322,920,896,892,1304,408,385,4688,9177,1788,363,304,27375,10489,953,6847,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,1033,14169,515,901,7542,537,322,3829,29889,13,13,1576,25657,432,17204,1546,1422,23820,1728,13138,263,2821,15474,1230,470,16667,4972,310,7014,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,9558,515,278,671,310,508,4314,297,17148,29086,304,278,1375,292,310,1016,2786,338,451,10597,29892,322,372,29915,29879,451,9186,2821,825,278,25657,338,1811,304,27769,29889,19814,29892,777,310,278,25260,526,3755,1472,322,378,1555,3860,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,29889,13,13,8809,488,278,25657,947,3867,777,8031,17099,322,1663,5861,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,13013,322,7542,537,297,1009,24329,29889,2973,777,23484,1080,304,11157,278,4972,322,3829,310,278,12032,29892,306,4658,278,25657,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,322,11828,297,378,345,5414,1009,2643,29889],"total_duration":68316270094,"load_duration":334021,"prompt_eval_count":312,"prompt_eval_duration":35514643000,"eval_count":229,"eval_duration":32800649000}
