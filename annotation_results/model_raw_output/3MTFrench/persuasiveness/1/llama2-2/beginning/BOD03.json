{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-24T20:04:25.215389879Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does an effective job of using rhetorical devices such as repetition and metaphor to emphasize their points, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of vivid imagery and storytelling to make the message more engaging and relatable for the audience. For example, the speaker uses the image of \"vouloir être d'accord avec la danse\" to convey the idea that learning should be a enjoyable and inclusive experience. Additionally, the use of rhetorical questions such as \"Pourquoi est-ce que l'on ne parle pas de l'enseignement de la danse?\" helps to engage the audience and encourage them to think critically about the topic.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a claim that \"il n'y a pas d'importance\" when it comes to learning dance, but this is not fully developed or supported by evidence. Additionally, the speaker's argument that \"n'est pas artiste qui veut\" and that there is a \"société de castes\" in the world of dance could be more nuanced and critically examined.\n\nOverall, while the speech effectively uses rhetorical devices to make its points, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,818,9364,276,712,29871,29947,29900,29995,316,7814,623,7771,790,1179,3435,1871,2406,29892,274,29915,342,818,2970,29892,427,316,29882,943,316,301,29915,29948,10936,29892,301,29915,328,663,29892,610,17488,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,425,23532,427,4880,424,443,20102,2535,26814,4595,29899,29886,1908,2123,10440,427,544,27153,443,9587,29889,838,11867,325,10281,29892,1444,7890,953,29885,8146,1465,29871,4277,2535,19601,29889,11948,2331,270,29915,5215,749,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,270,29915,5215,749,29889,2581,7890,16623,12278,1875,9291,29915,30001,270,29915,5753,442,782,885,1690,2445,284,1671,343,623,29878,9030,425,6025,344,15296,279,29892,425,6025,344,316,425,285,9061,29892,425,6025,344,553,19452,553,7774,267,14938,7147,29889,422,1004,1444,26099,2600,316,6025,344,634,712,1444,592,26099,15935,5483,1671,14344,29899,455,29892,875,355,712,14954,1173,1509,427,8825,316,301,29915,29948,29392,29892,1444,592,26099,9667,29948,3440,707,29899,346,712,301,29915,265,15210,270,29915,1947,332,634,270,29915,1947,1509,316,872,2594,276,29889,478,29884,270,29915,1654,29892,980,7890,9378,277,316,7890,1663,699,276,1465,1597,904,10936,316,6025,344,29889,11948,18916,29892,980,302,29915,264,263,2331,29889,1174,5246,29892,302,29915,342,2331,1616,2488,1750,2453,329,29889,315,29915,342,1597,19513,316,4320,267,29889,5202,276,10098,29892,427,319,24361,316,4562,342,29892,966,1029,898,267,269,30000,6609,409,16623,10978,610,11449,634,409,1301,2527,4904,316,6094,10500,427,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,773,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,1539,481,2015,304,19310,675,1009,3291,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,5828,29873,7807,304,1207,278,2643,901,3033,6751,322,1104,17219,363,278,20026,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3913,278,1967,310,376,29894,283,417,381,7848,270,29915,5753,536,2535,425,6025,344,29908,304,27769,278,2969,393,6509,881,367,263,13389,519,322,20978,573,7271,29889,19814,29892,278,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,1316,408,376,29925,473,339,7768,707,29899,346,712,301,29915,265,452,610,280,2331,316,301,29915,1947,647,882,316,425,6025,344,3026,6911,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,13731,6617,963,304,1348,3994,1711,1048,278,11261,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,393,376,309,302,29915,29891,263,2331,270,29915,5215,749,29908,746,372,5304,304,6509,17948,29892,541,445,338,451,8072,8906,470,6969,491,10757,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,376,29876,29915,342,2331,1616,2488,1750,2453,329,29908,322,393,727,338,263,376,2839,7342,316,4320,267,29908,297,278,3186,310,17948,1033,367,901,4948,8362,322,3994,1711,4392,1312,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,1207,967,3291,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889],"total_duration":67443194547,"load_duration":275977,"prompt_eval_count":306,"prompt_eval_duration":25651440000,"eval_count":341,"eval_duration":41790858000}
