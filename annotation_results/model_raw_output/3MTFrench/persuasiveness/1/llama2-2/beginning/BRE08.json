{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-26T00:44:18.306733289Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and a conversational tone to engage the audience and make their point about the need for local authorities to take control of their own development. However, the reasoning presented is not particularly rigorous or evidence-based, which detracts from the overall persuasive power of the speech.\n\nThe speaker's use of humor and irony in addressing the president of the Republic is also a strength of the speech, as it helps to build rapport with the audience and make the message more palatable. However, the reliance on anecdotal evidence and personal opinions rather than rigorous data and analysis may limit the speech's persuasive power for some listeners.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates a clear passion and conviction about the issue, the lack of robust evidence and reasoning may limit the speech's effectiveness in convincing those who are not already inclined to agree with the message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,18080,29892,17043,5582,29920,29899,23088,454,2123,301,29915,314,1908,316,26814,7096,1577,2581,7890,2437,568,5646,29892,29871,4277,14034,29920,454,2123,301,29915,314,1908,316,26814,7096,818,301,29915,19800,29879,1318,29892,766,424,782,15745,316,425,21919,29889,26383,5646,454,3390,712,1444,7890,18332,29892,274,29915,342,454,15745,29892,301,29915,25165,316,301,29915,29874,680,24305,297,29948,9639,815,634,297,1114,415,29948,269,29915,342,6624,1318,29889,2664,8478,7719,1887,267,2062,2108,296,301,29915,314,1908,316,425,24159,7890,592,2970,26477,29892,634,6079,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29945,29892,443,14954,1173,332,17153,970,263,443,20207,20827,634,269,29915,309,707,2778,29887,5128,29948,443,7877,15471,29889,3387,882,29892,1667,2167,344,14931,1190,966,15481,371,270,29915,13453,29884,663,1750,20423,1539,2484,2637,23778,29892,301,29915,16061,634,553,8478,7719,1887,267,553,301,29915,272,1912,553,6367,1080,29892,553,11984,29892,553,10402,4110,634,6701,553,11510,1336,6544,14864,2257,364,575,882,1465,301,29915,29874,680,782,24305,29889,2581,286,29915,524,29948,23458,2298,10816,3479,8478,7719,1887,267,316,22114,29899,509,283,1691,316,7691,29892,868,4595,29899,509,283,1691,316,7691,610,346,712,427,5246,29892,373,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,263,9678,1288,16225,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,1009,1298,1048,278,817,363,1887,21142,304,2125,2761,310,1009,1914,5849,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,9132,338,451,10734,12912,20657,470,10757,29899,6707,29892,607,1439,1461,29879,515,278,12463,20408,294,573,3081,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,27448,322,3805,2592,297,3211,292,278,6673,310,278,8063,338,884,263,9324,310,278,12032,29892,408,372,6911,304,2048,13659,411,278,20026,322,1207,278,2643,901,5112,17219,29889,2398,29892,278,12536,749,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,26971,3265,1135,12912,20657,848,322,7418,1122,4046,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,573,3081,363,777,11621,414,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,9004,1078,263,2821,15935,322,7602,2463,1048,278,2228,29892,278,10225,310,16424,10757,322,24481,1122,4046,278,12032,29915,29879,2779,20193,297,17953,3277,1906,1058,526,451,2307,1343,1312,304,8661,411,278,2643,29889],"total_duration":119651152831,"load_duration":268444,"prompt_eval_count":251,"prompt_eval_duration":26338777000,"eval_count":229,"eval_duration":93311431000}
