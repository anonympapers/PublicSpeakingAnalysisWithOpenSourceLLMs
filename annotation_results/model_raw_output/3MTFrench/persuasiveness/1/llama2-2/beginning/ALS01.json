The speaker does present some convincing arguments and uses relatable examples to illustrate their points, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of vivid imagery and relatable examples to help the audience visualize the problem of clogged arteries. The speaker does a good job of explaining the consequences of this problem, such as the accumulation of plaque and the resulting difficulties with mobility. They also provide a clear and concise definition of the issue, which helps to establish their credibility on the topic.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a claim about the number of new cases of clogged arteries in Europe each year without providing any evidence or sources to back up this claim. Additionally, the comparison between a clogged artery and a rubber hose is not entirely clear and could be further explained or illustrated to help drive home the point.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make the speech even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,4723,29899,355,16825,29892,432,29915,1794,17161,29948,425,18234,316,611,15378,545,626,347,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,2331,2653,23532,316,4662,1173,610,346,712,454,4832,4079,4370,289,3222,29948,29889,435,29915,1794,3669,2608,29948,454,977,2484,427,11510,284,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,348,29884,29889,2581,1224,1794,1597,289,2663,1924,316,1437,29890,3222,261,818,301,29915,18441,29892,21181,818,9073,29889,9353,425,6316,29892,1444,26099,1006,484,427,521,381,2007,347,325,6151,1070,29889,2598,13911,333,819,29892,274,29915,342,316,1437,29890,3222,261,966,5291,29891,2993,868,14913,3165,475,29892,4875,707,325,3324,29889,751,392,1597,325,3324,707,289,3222,1318,29892,610,443,5777,453,327,316,13625,29892,373,6309,439,29915,1808,707,25063,27737,1318,29892,373,452,8164,2331,3948,30037,357,454,13625,316,18342,261,29889,1720,269,29915,5753,398,1297,29892,980,2181,1318,316,301,29915,585,2310,1004,29892,553,4662,280,1295,29892,610,10098,6701,553,2174,1912,29892,1750,452,269,29915,29891,439,986,296,2331,634,553,5189,743,818,425,1766,1173,29889,1174,4092,29892,18402,19951,29892,274,29915,342,29871,29941,29871,29900,29900,29900,26957,18554,1750,325,609,7848,1098,9030,5278,4439,328,347,29889,10016,325,3324,29892,274,29915,342,427,5291,29891,585,29892,3503,274,29915,342,427,5291,29891,585,1750,707,9364,424,29892,1750,2947,1841,351,381,18097,980,707,289,3222,29948,29889,1720,2947,343,11469,553,1374,1690,290,22702,270,29915,262,22328,362,29889,5791,904,4230,293,2131,2947,1874,261,29889,315,29915,342,818,2970,872,11101,2131,818,409,1437,24784,7209,409,274,9498,29889,8748,9411,7015,1374,1690,290,22702,29892,439,29915,265,623,1808,454,16558,1004,316,425,1444,30095,276,325,1600,1314,29892,3435,22572,29915,15669,7006,11009,375,29892,3503,26154,7006,2852,566,631,29889,1394,1354,373,452,872,277,2331,3440,29871,4277,1766,1173,29892,634,3856,373,452,8164,2331,577,21216,29889,315,29915,342,4191,1465,611,350,1789,533,29892,1354,274,29915,342,454,508,538,1750,707,20450,29948,29892,274,29915,342,2331,454,1437,29890,3222,538,15617,680,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,1104,17219,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,1104,17219,6455,304,1371,278,20026,7604,675,278,1108,310,274,1188,3192,564,357,583,29889,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,24232,278,27721,310,445,1108,29892,1316,408,278,18414,2785,310,2174,802,322,278,9819,23553,411,22458,1793,29889,2688,884,3867,263,2821,322,3022,895,5023,310,278,2228,29892,607,6911,304,10127,1009,6625,4127,373,278,11261,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,1048,278,1353,310,716,4251,310,274,1188,3192,564,357,583,297,4092,1269,1629,1728,13138,738,10757,470,8974,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,10230,1546,263,274,1188,3192,564,22005,322,263,14051,495,298,852,338,451,9186,2821,322,1033,367,4340,10824,470,26848,304,1371,7899,3271,278,1298,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,278,12032,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":83229288963,"load_duration":245377,"prompt_eval_count":422,"prompt_eval_duration":44511730000,"eval_count":280,"eval_duration":38716764000}
