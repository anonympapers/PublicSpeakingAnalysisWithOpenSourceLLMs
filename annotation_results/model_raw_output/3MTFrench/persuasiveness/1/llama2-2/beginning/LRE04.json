The speaker presents some convincing arguments and reasoning, but there are also some areas where their message could be improved.\n\nThe speaker starts off by establishing their credibility as a historian, which helps to build trust with the audience. They then use historical examples to make their point about the difficulties of giving birth in the past. However, they could have provided more concrete evidence or examples to support their claims, especially when discussing the medicalization of childbirth.\n\nThe speaker also uses rhetorical questions to engage the audience and encourage them to think critically about the topic. For example, they ask \"But on contraste, je vous parlais des graphies de moni-tourine, de suivi-grossesse, ça vous parle peut-être un peu plus.\" This helps to keep the audience engaged and interested in the speaker's message.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speaker could improve their persuasiveness. For example, they could have provided more specific examples or data to support their claims about the medicalization of childbirth. Additionally, the speaker could have used more varied and inclusive language to appeal to a wider range of audience members.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments and reasoning, there are also areas where they could improve their message to be more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,980,343,263,19449,1750,7175,2218,296,425,286,7342,29877,2123,10440,19449,1750,7175,2218,296,425,6003,381,4191,5278,19489,30000,1030,10395,420,6600,655,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,452,544,2487,12737,264,29892,3503,1444,16623,21907,12784,316,6628,1314,29889,4731,7081,29892,1444,592,17775,1759,1465,454,8714,29889,6101,1444,7890,766,274,29915,14386,782,885,711,316,12534,538,29892,2257,21714,4439,29887,457,29892,26520,293,309,457,2123,10440,3814,316,282,1064,262,2075,2131,29892,7890,316,13325,7890,2970,3503,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,1808,8556,1153,535,371,29889,11948,373,4313,5340,29892,1444,7890,610,11818,553,22956,583,316,1601,29875,29899,29873,473,457,29892,316,480,8107,29899,29887,2124,5340,29892,29871,4277,7890,610,280,8164,29899,5474,443,7006,2298,29889,1459,2460,7890,29892,4883,270,1280,409,29627,29892,8164,29899,5474,712,3058,267,4625,20737,27282,1055,9948,29889,8748,25763,7890,29892,4473,8894,29892,6079,29892,7890,8992,29920,2304,29948,29889,390,932,6146,29920,29899,23088,1465,5278,269,3498,270,29915,562,3222,882,29892,553,14884,29892,553,25974,1144,29892,553,269,1179,27965,1314,6282,316,7890,29892,5646,707,11266,16083,11728,29892,4313,30069,12898,634,966,289,10126,743,19445,427,1735,25595,358,427,3209,316,25698,5000,29889,11948,1190,6033,1647,29899,29903,1450,1100,766,424,427,564,9318,29892,1539,2484,782,9122,634,6003,381,782,9122,302,29915,29948,13048,2331,521,2631,2258,21873,29889,405,681,1047,4467,427,29871,29896,29929,29946,29953,29889,997,5027,13094,707,443,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,2831,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,6287,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,1009,2643,1033,367,16710,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,1283,491,10127,292,1009,6625,4127,408,263,27629,29892,607,6911,304,2048,9311,411,278,20026,29889,2688,769,671,15839,6455,304,1207,1009,1298,1048,278,23553,310,6820,12060,297,278,4940,29889,2398,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,18387,10757,470,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,7148,746,5353,292,278,16083,2133,310,2278,29890,7515,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,13731,6617,963,304,1348,3994,1711,1048,278,11261,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,2244,376,6246,373,4313,4350,29892,1444,7890,610,11818,553,3983,583,316,1601,29875,29899,29873,473,457,29892,316,480,8107,29899,29887,2124,5340,29892,29871,4277,7890,610,280,8164,29899,5474,443,7006,2298,1213,910,6911,304,3013,278,20026,17785,322,8852,297,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,20408,294,20193,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,16083,2133,310,2278,29890,7515,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1304,901,23821,322,20978,573,4086,304,25530,304,263,25734,3464,310,20026,5144,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,727,526,884,10161,988,896,1033,11157,1009,2643,304,367,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":141931018094,"load_duration":266888,"prompt_eval_count":310,"prompt_eval_duration":31396840000,"eval_count":312,"eval_duration":110532021000}
