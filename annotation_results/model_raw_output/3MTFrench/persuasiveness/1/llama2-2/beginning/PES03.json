The speaker presents some interesting insights and observations about the role of urine in the ecological transition, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more supporting evidence and examples to back up their claims. For instance, they mention that urine is rich in nutrients and can be used as a fertilizer, but they do not provide any data or studies to demonstrate this effectiveness. Similarly, while the historian's perspective on the 19th century valorization of urine is interesting, the speaker could have provided more context and analysis to illustrate how this historical practice relates to the current ecological crisis.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's argument relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and personal experience, which may not be sufficient to convince a wider audience of the urine's potential as a solution to environmental problems. While the speaker's grandmother's request for \"pipi\" is an interesting starting point, more empirical evidence and scientific research could have been incorporated into the argument to make it more persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some intriguing ideas, the argument could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and supporting evidence to make it more convincing and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,818,301,29915,12352,300,8450,29875,1190,301,29915,279,1091,23536,29889,4785,309,30001,2257,712,9667,1249,611,4595,29899,29885,1908,818,7015,5697,1169,21038,29889,8526,301,29915,25165,29892,1444,452,1841,29926,314,1759,10420,29948,712,432,29915,9864,275,9073,316,425,23520,1190,454,8450,29875,29889,8748,26154,29892,1444,302,29915,6698,1794,18413,6382,17856,712,610,5278,544,15819,29892,611,4595,29899,29885,1908,3006,1249,8164,29899,5474,1597,4224,1026,316,425,9558,904,21553,1387,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,1444,8182,275,966,6896,19718,316,28374,17119,1475,9638,361,3783,1671,16455,643,425,26805,553,12241,3165,13116,29889,28079,270,29915,24430,29892,425,4824,29875,5458,868,14913,3165,475,7629,276,712,274,29915,342,610,966,5065,1475,712,454,14913,10019,562,3121,425,4655,2131,270,29915,1690,329,29878,2073,29889,997,447,1082,553,410,6772,1475,29892,966,4497,1195,6947,1314,4191,454,285,1485,344,1454,2123,454,3104,465,1974,29889,997,4595,29899,29885,1908,4875,8556,7629,276,712,966,715,3794,409,302,473,29878,19047,925,882,316,7015,302,473,29878,1475,634,712,301,29915,332,457,707,443,15129,16464,29889,1174,4951,29892,966,3603,11689,1601,509,296,2117,1306,782,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29892,443,553,1203,10270,6299,1166,2993,316,425,26805,316,301,29915,267,699,1211,3165,9874,6303,316,16497,7608,966,5065,1475,1671,16380,12121,2257,11412,316,18254,5632,457,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,1663,5861,322,13917,1048,278,6297,310,5065,457,297,278,321,21553,936,9558,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,20382,10757,322,6455,304,1250,701,1009,16726,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,3585,393,5065,457,338,8261,297,18254,374,1237,322,508,367,1304,408,263,19965,309,3950,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,848,470,11898,304,22222,445,2779,20193,29889,20175,29892,1550,278,27629,29915,29879,18520,373,278,29871,29896,29929,386,6462,16497,2133,310,5065,457,338,8031,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,7418,304,28475,920,445,15839,6944,1104,1078,304,278,1857,321,21553,936,24161,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,7271,29892,607,1122,451,367,8002,304,7602,1239,263,25734,20026,310,278,5065,457,29915,29879,7037,408,263,1650,304,29380,4828,29889,5806,278,25657,29915,29879,4595,29885,1228,29915,29879,2009,363,376,13096,29875,29908,338,385,8031,6257,1298,29892,901,29190,936,10757,322,16021,5925,1033,505,1063,11039,630,964,278,2980,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,11158,5526,292,7014,29892,278,2980,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,20382,10757,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,322,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":139878750176,"load_duration":260705,"prompt_eval_count":284,"prompt_eval_duration":31895834000,"eval_count":306,"eval_duration":107981948000}
