The speaker presents a novel approach to cancer treatment by utilizing the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. Lack of detail: The speaker mentions the use of anticorps (soldiers of the immune system) to fight cancer, but does not provide sufficient details on how this approach would work in practice. More information on the mechanisms involved and the potential challenges to be overcome would make the argument more convincing.\n2. Limited scope: The speaker focuses solely on the use of anticorps to treat cancer, without considering other potential approaches or combinations of treatments. A more comprehensive analysis would take into account the various treatment options available and their relative effectiveness.\n3. Unclear conclusions: The speaker concludes that the use of anticorps is a promising approach to cancer treatment, but does not provide clear evidence to support this claim. More data or studies on the efficacy of this approach would be needed to draw firm conclusions.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents an interesting and innovative idea for cancer treatment, more rigorous reasoning and supporting evidence are required to make a strong case for its effectiveness.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,897,7814,16283,29892,28194,7890,8992,29920,3008,28230,270,29915,5474,577,647,743,1671,443,23900,29892,966,28374,1020,667,1237,712,301,29915,265,7890,16193,3435,12852,301,30057,305,743,316,13219,2390,347,29892,425,7155,29899,357,2390,347,29892,425,521,381,2007,347,2123,1597,4145,1099,2285,316,5278,364,14856,1318,316,9122,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,427,2298,868,872,17949,712,274,29915,342,11878,18097,274,29915,342,23778,29892,274,29915,342,11043,270,29915,18949,375,8648,301,29915,29923,16100,29882,1682,8146,29892,2148,275,424,553,1801,1691,1473,7147,1671,301,29915,459,362,29889,10016,1650,818,2257,25698,5000,29892,25810,12866,270,29915,3451,2376,261,1597,11043,452,7631,264,966,269,5903,375,18097,274,29915,342,23778,20498,882,634,1671,18729,29892,373,1671,8356,3667,7608,966,5239,1446,316,24145,5198,348,2131,966,3677,293,272,567,29889,751,392,8556,1047,4467,4439,3076,29892,24145,21423,5198,348,9407,29892,9484,29948,634,17631,417,347,553,5697,3246,6062,29948,21337,29892,966,3677,293,272,567,29892,553,5239,1446,1750,623,2518,993,316,1437,371,312,261,634,452,3534,275,296,5646,454,19872,23428,4600,1597,26722,805,4582,22781,29889,7747,13180,1465,454,3209,868,23900,29892,966,4047,1912,427,5902,344,452,325,609,2331,7848,25456,4191,443,1559,5606,29899,509,4600,29892,634,610,1136,29948,16011,24145,2894,6386,302,29915,264,874,818,2331,1487,289,30057,29948,11062,12794,316,899,4130,29889,319,622,29948,1465,301,29915,6388,6386,29892,7015,5239,1446,452,25238,19047,2331,712,966,4047,1912,427,5902,344,16933,20737,1597,289,7293,1935,2390,347,29892,6701,1354,454,452,1671,336,2414,29890,1803,276,439,29915,348,767,1173,29889,11948,1354,373,6267,3023,484,29892,427,2298,805,1540,270,29915,279,1030,29892,2117,1849,316,260,2491,634,274,29915,342,301,29915,4422,7454,316,6062,29948,21337,304,29916,3783,29892,373,26030,553,5239,1446,2654,449,1849,818,1487,904,26737,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,20408,294,573,2643,29889,450,25657,22981,263,9554,2948,304,23900,14502,491,3667,5281,278,3573,29915,29879,5198,1540,1788,304,8589,23900,9101,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,9493,29901,450,25657,26649,278,671,310,3677,293,272,567,313,29879,1025,4285,310,278,5198,1540,1788,29897,304,8589,23900,29892,541,947,451,3867,8002,4902,373,920,445,2948,723,664,297,6944,29889,5853,2472,373,278,7208,12903,9701,322,278,7037,18066,267,304,367,25688,723,1207,278,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,29906,29889,28873,6874,29901,450,25657,8569,267,14419,368,373,278,671,310,3677,293,272,567,304,7539,23900,29892,1728,13858,916,7037,13501,470,18240,310,7539,1860,29889,319,901,15171,6270,7418,723,2125,964,3633,278,5164,14502,3987,3625,322,1009,6198,2779,20193,29889,13,29941,29889,853,8551,21204,1080,29901,450,25657,378,27722,393,278,671,310,3677,293,272,567,338,263,2504,5921,2948,304,23900,14502,29892,541,947,451,3867,2821,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,5853,848,470,11898,373,278,6366,4135,310,445,2948,723,367,4312,304,4216,9226,21204,1080,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,385,8031,322,24233,1230,2969,363,23900,14502,29892,901,12912,20657,24481,322,20382,10757,526,3734,304,1207,263,4549,1206,363,967,2779,20193,29889],"total_duration":82211250719,"load_duration":267836,"prompt_eval_count":388,"prompt_eval_duration":40957088000,"eval_count":299,"eval_duration":41253342000}
