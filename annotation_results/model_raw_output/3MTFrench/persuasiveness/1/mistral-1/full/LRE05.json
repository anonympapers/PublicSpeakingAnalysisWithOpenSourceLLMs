{"model":"mistral","created_at":"2024-04-05T19:49:59.789447918Z","response":" Based on the given transcript, I would evaluate the persuasiveness of the speech as a 4. The speaker effectively presents logical reasons and justifications for their stance against adding an additional 150,000 inhabitants to their community. They use examples such as limited resources for food production, strained employment levels, and infrastructure limitations to make their case. However, they also acknowledge the need for adaptation to specific territories and the importance of collaboration with stakeholders to create effective urban planning solutions. While persuasive in content, the speaker's delivery could benefit from clearer organization and smoother transitions between ideas to enhance audience engagement.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,334,28742,374,28705,28770,28734,8804,28725,13662,1201,677,521,3841,281,28742,8237,279,1549,1289,543,3264,14324,28723,16549,526,28742,374,28733,358,955,28705,10456,2268,1550,12494,307,28742,374,955,28705,28740,28782,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,19414,1461,452,22952,10024,1289,305,28742,28762,28721,28797,28725,13086,526,28742,581,18777,28715,28742,24281,28725,13662,284,2864,1053,1289,3264,19571,267,1289,543,1493,5224,28723,334,28742,374,11631,28705,28740,28782,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,16720,631,1461,452,22952,10024,1289,307,423,28441,27462,13662,17025,13782,340,4885,5497,3607,1442,911,955,13662,13662,549,4955,1053,340,543,287,539,3228,28723,334,28742,374,11631,28705,28740,28782,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,16421,4601,3263,1442,1289,14791,263,27462,2505,18777,28715,28742,24281,459,267,261,4601,340,484,28906,28719,465,934,430,631,634,28705,28750,28734,16036,911,481,3013,28725,277,28742,374,28705,28740,28782,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,19414,1461,452,22952,10024,1147,10404,16425,28320,3586,570,1147,317,1554,28723,16549,307,28742,339,5620,3557,757,324,28725,277,28742,374,430,1231,8158,340,711,2136,263,1415,15004,1514,6419,1399,411,911,2669,11223,1514,284,1089,411,28723,418,607,1182,1053,9182,28797,462,28146,281,28742,370,1187,3012,484,17499,28725,3025,4817,28706,1289,2170,7242,305,28742,274,2644,340,1966,11838,28797,1693,267,5672,3432,28709,1126,28725,281,28742,581,18777,28715,28742,24281,911,340,1493,426,28723,4573,430,28768,1468,281,28742,370,1187,3012,462,484,17499,28725,3025,23473,485,549,329,14924,9628,28723,12494,19423,13662,1182,1053,2248,28797,1289,261,274,28725,955,3670,3025,1829,631,22440,1326,5029,426,435,1829,631,3557,354,22034,466,22440,3418,28710,28723,15540,364,3950,1550,2316,358,955,462,28146,281,28742,370,1187,3012,1415,408,28876,333,24533,11983,8018,28797,1289,1966,26372,536,911,277,28742,374,3670,28733,28714,28839,3025,6884,2800,294,546,543,11198,281,28742,370,837,262,465,324,1289,543,3264,14324,28723,2316,3670,955,1843,7987,1044,19255,511,449,308,4969,457,1289,634,430,28768,1468,8018,1442,2505,379,4690,424,340,5376,473,28725,5359,481,3285,28725,1514,24657,435,427,605,14763,308,3557,305,28742,1802,911,305,28742,25538,911,1514,26372,3053,5497,23749,28713,940,902,278,2422,543,10274,11564,28723,976,734,3418,28710,28725,16249,4328,28725,2218,435,757,1554,3557,2085,263,28705,28740,28782,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,635,323,596,28723,334,28742,374,363,27097,28725,1521,528,3510,279,26941,1289,2219,28014,4262,340,23274,340,28705,28782,28734,28734,290,21412,340,24373,955,461,28742,4138,7590,1585,1289,4128,285,14583,28725,12410,1011,13662,307,28742,494,1053,3557,340,261,4550,1147,462,26372,536,28723,16549,28725,481,28705,28740,28734,28734,28734,28725,462,13053,3781,4346,2219,3431,3241,28725,543,990,3228,634,19414,28725,3466,16921,543,261,28891,631,12429,357,3228,2669,1514,3884,15099,28725,2218,637,278,955,2144,2218,284,1058,28764,28725,634,5146,3378,481,21726,28797,425,465,481,1233,577,1642,3228,28723,451,28718,28725,2218,307,28742,1585,3557,2669,2219,24303,7103,28723,1343,10274,28725,2218,435,757,1554,3557,307,423,28441,28705,28740,28782,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,19414,28723,334,28742,374,363,27097,28725,1521,3510,4807,340,408,14068,462,14366,3466,340,10404,16421,4601,28725,911,281,28742,269,15349,2219,17310,28706,11885,1254,28725,5359,27462,13662,1847,1053,6780,361,1514,2545,749,634,3763,11091,1549,28725,940,13791,28725,3670,955,3418,28710,2218,757,1554,15349,28725,277,28742,374,2306,14615,28797,3025,934,634,305,28742,9035,631,281,28742,314,2864,3012,3025,4536,4346,1966,26372,536,28723,15540,277,4403,28725,461,28742,1585,3432,2448,281,28742,262,674,697,1147,543,4889,28725,1147,305,28742,28797,2868,412,28725,305,28742,24825,14482,28725,3466,481,379,28714,323,7985,911,9628,281,28742,25538,28723,3217,28541,28725,277,28742,374,340,19893,8878,4346,1326,4574,4296,324,2669,481,19609,3781,634,15167,340,949,25012,911,634,10181,340,12270,10425,28725,1514,5227,697,7286,461,28742,1585,3432,2448,28723,16549,461,28742,1585,11631,3432,2448,634,960,16465,340,305,28742,314,2864,3012,28725,3025,5497,1514,2248,16465,340,28146,28725,911,16906,28725,543,4889,28725,461,28742,1585,3264,766,670,1289,521,15644,7939,3243,11571,911,528,779,79
