The speaker uses a metaphorical comparison between a concrete bridge and the human body to explain the concept of corrosion in concrete structures. They provide a detailed explanation of the causes and consequences of corrosion, and introduce the use of engineering models to predict and anticipate the risk of corrosion in concrete structures. The speaker's reasoning is rigorous and persuasive as they present a clear connection between the concepts of corrosion and its impact on concrete structures, and the importance of using engineering models to mitigate the risks.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,259,29215,28708,11198,28764,16906,955,10274,1514,20687,28713,7957,287,28876,8901,3648,4473,12631,1071,481,287,4854,282,770,28723,3745,267,466,8052,526,28742,3222,264,543,18406,8462,3913,521,20687,7957,287,28876,8901,3648,4473,911,462,16214,1997,426,28723,334,28742,374,16249,1129,1289,305,28742,501,21641,1415,16214,1997,426,28725,1521,337,934,4693,2505,427,1730,28723,1337,1543,3464,18061,28725,27631,278,955,2422,462,287,28876,8901,3648,4473,28725,1521,337,264,2219,2505,765,329,408,1089,340,543,268,749,28723,2236,357,262,28797,2219,6125,316,412,2505,427,1730,261,3222,526,28742,3222,18488,28723,14527,3670,526,28742,28708,1514,17729,268,28742,269,11334,26543,1022,911,435,363,677,3557,1003,452,361,10441,26651,28723,2316,1102,14177,308,28725,462,16214,934,2211,28797,1231,412,28723,14527,462,287,28876,8901,3648,4473,28725,8821,6125,316,412,2505,427,1730,934,543,1275,2737,296,28723,1700,1275,2737,296,634,3648,1373,356,264,2144,911,1415,3517,940,6935,11767,717,638,12843,28723,1337,22168,4263,450,340,1253,15600,3025,934,8941,7286,543,711,290,11222,15349,28725,8273,934,1514,19464,512,12130,3025,5497,9671,788,2422,305,28742,25538,3051,911,1514,356,1473,1606,1829,1126,28723,17097,11767,717,638,12843,19548,308,340,284,2864,28797,434,263,2422,462,287,28876,8901,14850,28742,28839,438,424,507,267,10441,1610,324,281,28742,323,749,28723,16035,15396,543,1275,2737,296,837,423,28717,2110,28725,543,6869,6813,19396,28725,8273,427,319,266,1134,1022,8159,317,512,28708,18408,287,28876,8901,28723,9801,1439,2110,634,16568,16963,2278,274,1147,462,7944,28723,3291,16906,543,6813,3809,4828,1514,1102,14177,2119,28723,5684,267,13212,526,28742,266,268,28742,374,26601,28797,634,575,4544,2669,264,1184,1514,4155,2864,14544,1289,12823,3351,911,2725,2650,487,10441,6599,1011,340,1275,2737,296,2422,1514,3466,11277,465,7957,7101,28876,8901,3648,4473,28723,17097,575,4544,5497,634,968,28840,867,11049,28797,3076,4030,481,25929,634,968,28840,867,4155,2864,14544,28723,1618,1514,954,479,440,13255,940,358,526,28742,4544,5497,8018,1442,5672,6388,278,340,543,2996,1863,28706,634,3346,373,1190,340,287,28876,8901,287,28876,8901,287,28876,8901,28723,1700,2830,3974,340,11844,968,28840,867,911,281,28742,28708,547,1289,543,15396,28725,28705,10456,264,2219,4479,5463,12631,1001,28951,424,481,1850,274,340,12974,340,4900,911,18308,278,28725,5359,277,28742,374,2191,27423,1514,484,14779,427,3852,2741,308,28723,3291,290,28742,501,28797,25848,481,521,9877,12974,1289,12823,3351,543,6896,281,28742,1783,6752,340,543,1275,2737,296,28723,17365,6896,10384,1289,543,5598,2110,955,1514,11767,717,638,12843,1424,21846,2669,597,5350,481,26706,340,543,1610,324,28723,17097,5598,4473,2306,1693,308,1843,7987,1044,634,4331,281,28742,720,3640,28725,2669,7911,3160,1373,28725,1997,309,19682,28725,7986,28725,911,15987,634,11767,717,638,12843,2422,305,28742,24825,14482,28725,5359,13417,340,543,17025,3974,1415,287,28876,8901,1289,1699,488,263,10441,284,2864,28797,434,352,28723,17365,17025,3974,934,2784,4405,940,634,11634,1726,340,4397,28723,1337,23982,340,9652,340,11844,289,450,934,462,23982,281,28742,8645,7491,634,337,276,512,271,1238,28723,2316,26260,28725,2669,521,287,28876,8901,1289,20638,4397,28725,277,28742,374,5598,28797,2422,28705,28740,28734,28734,8804,28723,1700,3264,1727,300,677,352,960,19053,28725,10361,955,543,5598,2110,340,3345,281,28742,370,3466,11277,465,934,438,424,15883,28725,3466,15396,543,1275,2737,296,837,423,28717,2110,28723,318,734,481,8159,462,940,455,24265,28725,305,28742,18500,426,934,23604,3160,2110,5461,28725,2219,25040,544,770,28725,3670,3025,435,3557,363,27097,481,16166,28723,1700,2830,3974,340,1424,4110,14221,340,26590,631,934,281,28742,501,28797,820,263,543,3557,331,340,11166,352,340,1275,2737,296,7286,543,11198,281,28742,280,11277,465,268,28742,374,5598,2110,911,298,28714,20012,2669,2219,3466,2035,482,340,363,6915,482,340,6935,400,1238,481,363,288,28707,28733,370,2545,321,21412,28723,16035,5408,570,277,294,23097,28723,330,3670,341,770,28733,28714,28839,28725,1514,17487,13138,4230,4030,1415,20687,435,5497,3557,4814,4473,28723,1337,6599,1011,340,305,28742,6610,1089,267,466,340,305,28742,280,11277,465,23125,9433,7093,7987,1044,526,28742,269,543,1275,2737,296,438,424,15883,340,341,770,1182,834,2110,28723,5
