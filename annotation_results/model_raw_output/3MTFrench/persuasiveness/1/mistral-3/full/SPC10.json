The speaker effectively uses relatable examples, such as a crowd of primary school students and a portable phone battery, to explain the concept of superconductivity and its potential benefits. They also use storytelling techniques, humor, and an engaging tone to keep the audience's attention throughout the speech. However, the lack of clear calls-to-action or a specific ask from the audience may reduce the overall persuasiveness score slightly.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,475,28742,2371,263,1555,9628,16906,15349,15349,634,1233,2868,497,281,28742,28797,1079,10955,28723,13193,27424,15396,955,2218,1170,14455,1326,26337,28725,1521,484,581,496,28706,28723,334,28742,374,340,305,28742,28797,1079,10955,955,2218,2136,28706,28725,5359,3025,307,28742,283,6016,28052,1289,4128,7994,412,28723,28705,29215,28708,290,28742,28797,1079,333,28723,12184,16906,1550,15540,23913,267,3670,1108,2864,300,13139,634,484,581,496,4485,28725,7705,28764,2219,19893,291,281,28742,5560,24893,340,2413,5731,28725,1289,3025,356,1493,5224,281,28742,7590,2422,2219,5007,28723,13542,1289,543,1633,526,28742,309,1547,27897,363,570,2422,16065,1514,3564,9628,268,28951,28712,28723,1337,1547,440,1233,844,15663,28725,277,28742,374,543,10274,10008,28723,12494,5497,634,1233,844,13455,3025,427,2306,452,15352,2422,634,24071,21065,455,4030,28723,1418,10441,1493,5224,281,28742,7590,340,543,724,864,28723,9779,26337,28725,5359,1289,543,1633,28725,1521,5484,28725,1521,427,2334,28725,1521,268,28742,28797,1079,333,911,1521,268,28742,28797,338,751,28723,8693,356,8631,28728,1022,3247,1289,16065,11844,1233,844,13455,28725,340,427,2306,452,9172,1397,294,6467,2422,1514,24071,28725,12062,15349,462,2388,488,28725,5359,356,435,17266,10613,3285,281,28742,28797,1079,10955,297,329,546,466,28723,1418,2669,10613,3264,670,536,462,8581,340,5971,1233,844,373,5958,28723,1418,2669,10613,5756,263,340,305,28742,28797,1079,10955,297,1270,262,22952,3285,3191,269,340,427,3264,487,670,2422,1514,24071,911,1514,25267,28723,28705,29215,28708,1201,1022,2219,3264,22424,28723,16549,4517,1521,12688,28764,1550,15540,1514,10760,28840,1855,340,2413,5731,28725,277,28742,374,3252,546,28723,1418,1514,1424,481,6884,267,6935,940,6935,28723,16549,356,2669,1514,1233,844,13455,28725,277,28742,374,13103,309,28723,8693,356,12688,1289,15349,481,3127,28706,526,28742,309,427,2306,452,15352,6935,940,6935,2422,1514,24071,28725,1521,307,28742,28724,264,3285,281,28742,28797,338,581,496,1116,911,3285,340,660,424,281,28742,28797,1079,10955,28723,1418,954,3222,28705,10456,543,2195,10364,2478,449,3974,28723,4380,265,482,24862,28725,2669,337,597,5350,28725,1521,285,1228,19144,267,1289,15053,2388,331,7222,3160,1373,28723,15540,1514,1233,844,13455,28725,10274,28705,28734,340,820,1442,28725,277,28742,374,2219,354,28711,26289,8313,340,305,28742,28797,1391,2243,28723,14527,543,549,715,444,634,21065,4601,28725,1521,285,1228,19144,267,1289,17775,28705,28750,28784,28782,340,820,1442,28723,16549,3418,28710,28725,461,28742,1585,8582,8052,634,21065,4601,28725,1521,3510,279,340,19144,267,1289,17775,28705,28740,28781,28734,340,820,1442,28723,8500,28725,3614,28725,277,28742,374,16921,285,2938,28723,16549,28725,277,3674,5620,28733,28719,3950,28725,277,28742,374,347,14158,14245,3285,3252,546,1289,438,424,507,267,28723,334,28742,374,21065,322,3025,23125,340,2195,10364,2478,7093,1289,17775,28705,28740,28781,28734,340,820,1442,25509,462,27450,3334,340,13463,783,17748,28723,550,607,16906,1493,5224,28764,12122,28733,8437,11109,356,12122,7414,343,11844,24665,1554,13463,783,28891,2097,28723,13193,305,28742,28716,28906,28720,1803,28725,940,26260,28725,2422,1514,954,492,4544,28725,1521,337,264,1521,337,264,399,28755,28723,334,28742,374,847,28891,358,5672,25681,2959,1442,2195,10364,2478,17783,634,13463,783,28891,2097,955,305,28742,266,12122,14791,263,390,331,28764,281,28742,28797,1079,10955,1233,844,15663,2669,10979,3160,263,634,484,10991,9027,2959,4030,716,4839,3431,830,4473,462,16214,1997,426,28723,16549,305,28742,28797,13463,783,17748,28725,356,435,637,279,3557,4517,28705,10456,1829,631,28723,976,734,28725,2669,1514,23913,267,2422,1326,7867,28709,28725,2218,13087,1555,521,12631,2505,14989,425,440,340,543,1547,340,3264,3810,28797,28723,14527,8821,1547,28725,2218,4188,18606,8466,28725,2218,4188,18606,28725,637,8675,291,28725,637,7222,3160,1373,28725,462,8581,634,305,28840,1855,28723,2316,902,278,28725,19255,5497,9628,940,6935,28725,5359,940,902,278,28725,19255,13087,308,28725,285,3241,28725,818,412,28725,911,1289,7532,7532,28723,320,406,28725,277,28742,374,27492,1116,17236,634,1233,844,13455,955,461,28742,1585,8582,8052,28725,356,2306,4581,3557,2572,2422,1326,461,926,266,6702,462,26191,28733,28721,377,3466,543,307,4854,2959,294,3974,28723,1554
