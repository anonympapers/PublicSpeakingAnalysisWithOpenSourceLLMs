The speaker's reasoning is not completely clear and there are several unrelated elements mentioned in the speech that do not contribute to the overall message. Additionally, the use of metaphors and figurative language makes it difficult to follow the argument being presented. While there are some attempts at persuasion, such as the comparison of different energy sources to family members and the emphasis on the importance of renewable energy, these points are not developed in a rigorous or convincing manner.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,475,28742,1585,1289,543,3264,14324,2669,4128,306,26289,28725,5359,2218,363,1555,16906,940,1523,340,4128,5408,570,1147,5715,28725,3025,408,28876,333,340,24999,361,1627,21056,911,3025,290,28742,763,301,1022,4139,667,361,28723,475,28742,385,301,426,28725,2669,364,3950,8582,261,28742,274,940,28710,28725,2218,435,23913,28713,3557,3670,3025,261,28742,763,3665,28723,15540,28707,440,28725,356,337,10559,400,482,1554,28725,6339,3823,5731,10559,10979,24454,1554,28725,2669,8986,267,1326,16214,427,1776,536,28725,3418,28710,28725,1966,298,279,28725,461,28742,1585,757,324,1415,708,361,28723,13542,3466,28710,28725,28705,10456,290,28742,28708,19932,19932,28723,475,28742,1585,3264,766,670,28725,8582,26452,26765,5715,28725,461,28742,1585,467,1750,425,28797,521,396,940,28710,2669,1514,1595,520,634,1233,844,1491,385,5135,28725,5359,28705,10456,290,28742,28708,1304,3974,340,543,277,28742,374,28723,3291,528,519,278,8052,28725,2669,364,3950,435,3557,290,28742,262,6281,361,2422,305,28742,494,308,482,340,305,28742,28797,1079,10955,2128,5731,1289,543,3264,14324,28723,475,28742,1585,8738,280,2035,955,1514,1595,520,305,28742,28797,844,15663,2128,5731,28725,543,4885,634,1595,520,305,28742,28797,844,15663,2128,5731,307,28742,374,3557,2007,28719,522,28723,9801,2306,1693,340,305,28742,596,1254,309,1044,28723,4573,6269,335,4030,25090,308,19477,543,1424,28706,271,7851,2669,12823,18592,543,4885,281,28742,28797,1079,10955,2128,5731,28723,16549,461,28742,385,301,426,462,12974,526,28742,266,8986,28725,934,28733,358,12974,2278,1550,451,1724,28725,1521,290,28742,357,279,955,27424,2832,281,28742,28797,1079,10955,934,2219,340,261,274,290,314,278,28725,1289,3025,8582,5637,274,27424,27019,340,305,28742,926,308,340,284,11222,28723,2661,337,264,1289,4128,290,28742,28797,338,488,5997,911,4128,290,28742,326,555,28723,16549,28705,8668,5497,15053,11198,11619,911,901,269,28857,440,1289,2662,361,521,12631,290,581,28728,1555,28723,2661,337,264,1289,4128,290,28742,262,28718,533,5731,28725,5359,8582,390,23800,757,324,955,305,28742,926,308,12971,1011,28207,261,28742,17788,385,1022,543,5248,28723,13542,1521,337,264,4128,290,28742,278,328,1022,28723,334,28742,374,1289,12823,28722,3160,263,28725,911,1514,6766,314,278,3025,10979,18924,722,317,1554,28723,16549,11631,521,12631,6125,27212,1253,8273,435,28207,28052,28725,3670,955,8582,6783,390,5637,28797,28723,12184,15053,724,24476,2669,2170,7242,2219,3127,412,7132,28797,705,3913,5029,473,911,9628,3418,28710,28725,2218,519,278,462,27450,7581,296,3025,4536,1852,1268,361,10274,1147,305,28742,14286,911,8466,3247,8582,1847,26305,1493,4427,521,1461,452,22952,1289,4128,290,28742,28797,338,488,5997,2669,261,28742,293,3127,28710,7132,28797,705,28723,3291,519,278,19477,13861,481,364,14583,28725,1514,23749,274,13138,362,2804,340,724,8507,1522,2422,3670,305,28742,614,1044,28723,334,28742,374,12090,18707,28725,2218,290,28742,316,375,423,2640,412,28725,911,22440,2219,15053,11198,2457,25040,28725,1253,26941,28725,3025,28725,4346,1966,837,28710,28725,305,28742,28769,309,4555,28725,319,23133,8466,12986,28733,8041,28710,28725,462,11150,309,934,8688,28718,465,597,5350,1289,305,28742,1752,12764,28723,16549,1253,305,28742,14286,28725,305,28742,28769,309,4555,307,28742,23133,363,520,2487,3557,285,6109,28723,6021,8466,28725,461,28742,309,4555,28725,1289,4274,340,6293,263,462,11150,309,281,28742,299,1506,1651,28725,854,28710,940,427,724,19640,1514,14764,1554,911,1253,26941,28725,1170,10810,28723,475,28742,1585,954,28712,6915,755,26706,28705,28734,340,543,724,8507,1522,28723,1337,26706,28705,28740,934,954,492,28718,27462,634,13138,362,2804,297,3762,4030,28725,356,4069,570,340,949,1079,2219,724,8507,1522,9886,543,19396,281,28742,370,8581,28723,2316,26260,28725,462,27450,7581,296,711,8052,955,10274,1521,427,305,28742,14286,28725,261,28742,28708,1184,28708,281,28742,370,264,2614,28705,28740,28734,317,22751,28723,334,28742,374,28320,521,14441,911,543,3418,507,267,19473,324,1415,27450,7581,296,12410,1011,340,298,452,4886,1289,521,319,353,28797,2505,26592,2470,1289,3127,28710,7132,28797,705,28723,334,28742,374,2669,8821,26765,955,2218,6834,14286,1147,462,26706,28705,28750,28723,550,607,305,28742,458,28764,954,28712,8507,1522,911,949,1079,9886,19396,2347,6572,6508,28723,2316,26260,2
