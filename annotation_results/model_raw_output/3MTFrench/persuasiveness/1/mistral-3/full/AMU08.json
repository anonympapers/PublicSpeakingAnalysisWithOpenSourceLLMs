The speaker provides detailed explanations about the cause of the train derailment issue and presents a proposed solution with evidence-backed reasoning. The use of analogies and visualization techniques (going inside the rails) adds persuasiveness to the message, making it more engaging and easier to understand for the audience. However, there are some instances where the speech seems disconnected from the main topic (e.g., mentioning the difference between Marseille and Perpignan), which slightly decreases the overall persuasiveness score.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,3850,320,440,440,440,918,6068,384,433,528,5271,333,28723,25660,2505,2306,520,2487,281,28742,370,5835,28725,462,467,2015,294,934,791,436,2498,28723,550,607,337,1102,353,424,28764,1514,2401,4601,281,28742,2146,539,465,2669,15434,267,1514,261,293,1415,467,2015,294,28723,4573,11767,481,6935,1233,1294,28797,340,261,293,5497,1289,10454,267,704,3640,2669,8466,481,331,603,1116,28723,384,28742,377,22217,5972,5227,697,28725,1521,268,28742,357,279,281,28742,370,3264,24554,340,285,815,1238,3025,934,19744,28718,1289,543,5439,634,408,2014,911,264,8667,279,1289,10441,6869,447,482,28723,15540,15216,1554,23913,267,3670,1108,2864,300,13139,28725,1521,285,1228,427,549,566,263,2505,277,24627,634,408,2014,28723,13193,305,28742,501,21641,340,3670,1610,8909,581,28725,1514,998,5185,5497,15053,9628,14658,1442,911,1221,274,521,22936,2128,547,28723,16549,2505,2982,911,1289,5972,482,1415,12280,634,19770,28725,19255,363,677,427,16018,8974,7242,14850,28742,28839,4494,2219,8860,15053,11334,546,1289,12631,1514,23105,843,14455,28723,334,28742,374,18308,17218,466,8821,6896,3025,268,28742,374,285,815,324,28797,911,1289,8667,536,2505,2306,520,2487,1415,5835,28723,1700,5165,960,19053,2669,11310,2456,267,3670,430,1231,8158,4817,28706,1289,16479,26511,543,5439,634,408,2014,28723,16549,277,4403,1001,28951,424,18707,28725,5359,2669,3418,28710,18707,28725,16906,8631,20650,481,10305,270,281,28742,22008,7093,440,28723,351,3950,28725,5972,9869,9603,13875,481,7902,28725,290,28742,28708,4069,278,281,28742,20044,1514,14956,4061,2230,10110,340,3670,1108,2864,300,13139,28723,320,406,281,28742,375,556,28725,543,7222,3160,1373,28725,2669,1776,361,11844,16100,4473,14850,28742,28839,28705,28770,28734,28734,340,820,1442,28723,1618,15677,28725,543,2944,296,6535,2110,940,462,284,17653,1415,5835,340,28705,28781,28734,28734,6339,4511,2669,998,28797,1097,1514,16100,4473,911,462,8077,329,1116,28723,1337,1928,335,340,4128,306,26289,934,2306,4252,19838,1289,968,24265,11049,28797,3076,1651,28725,14632,28707,440,340,724,4652,536,2422,526,3222,4644,4536,427,4494,543,6896,843,14455,28723,1618,23473,1415,1212,340,5835,28725,911,634,4331,1415,467,2015,294,28723,1700,268,4652,3160,270,28725,1521,435,427,968,335,4807,3557,340,543,10274,23500,266,3913,543,12893,424,911,461,28742,1585,363,2110,940,28710,1471,331,2457,28725,3025,435,1776,279,3557,11844,28705,28781,28734,1233,28721,1442,940,3835,911,543,12893,424,911,7175,3913,660,28720,1468,481,12598,11844,439,28733,19838,667,278,4346,7987,1044,521,19353,271,940,3835,28723,1778,28891,358,1289,1326,968,24265,28725,2218,519,278,10637,340,724,4652,536,3670,955,4536,1083,361,462,8314,12986,27424,12280,340,5835,28723,16549,28725,14102,11310,517,270,28725,290,28742,28708,4069,278,281,28742,20044,1514,4061,2230,19913,1289,6599,1011,340,11515,340,6896,843,14455,28723,15540,1414,1184,3285,18308,17218,466,1326,968,24265,28725,634,3150,1555,481,7579,1827,536,5497,724,8507,381,28723,418,28742,339,440,9030,261,28742,28797,1097,281,28742,28724,1776,361,15349,337,1289,704,3640,28725,285,1228,340,562,1097,1289,19341,28725,305,28742,313,2110,911,340,12487,536,462,12280,281,28742,370,1850,4296,324,28723,451,1724,28725,2218,13087,28706,2505,27450,5835,28725,5359,3670,307,28742,374,3557,3459,1116,521,27450,5835,28725,5359,549,329,14924,521,8314,3884,19352,1147,462,21894,2219,5408,570,17148,28744,340,28705,28784,8372,340,10748,28840,4110,4536,3884,1079,28723,1778,28891,358,1289,1326,13660,28733,13641,28725,2218,1201,1585,10637,340,12487,536,23749,28713,4514,340,5835,911,340,12487,536,305,28742,14177,27524,340,17071,16010,340,12280,340,5835,28723,451,28718,26941,28725,543,28705,28750,28787,427,26506,28725,1521,934,12974,281,28742,7590,3264,28715,4886,1326,18778,2669,16249,1685,340,19341,1699,488,28723,320,28742,269,16110,28725,16110,918,5311,433,28725,290,1053,22534,28725,462,467,2015,294,1558,5082,20458,466,26776,1289,543,6552,883,724,8507,28718,2422,521,396,911,1493,28710,12986,14098,1415,18778,634,11725,28723,2280,267,511,310,7093,440,264,9628,18435,28797,1514,28705,28782,28733,28750,28734,1676,274,28725,3051,1189,340,10454,267,4501,28723,4709,733,28748,16289,28793,17158,356,272,2078,1203,2489,304,272,9711,302,14861,293,9992,5397,28725,315,682,4338,272,8666,390,264,28705,28781,356
