{"model":"mistral","created_at":"2024-04-07T16:25:31.731526321Z","response":" Based on the given transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4. The speaker effectively uses analogies and visualizations to convey her message about energy conservation and the importance of finding the best recipe for heating pool water. Her reasoning is also clear and logical as she explains the connection between the functioning of power plants and pool heating, and proposes a solution for reducing energy consumption during winter months. However, the speech could have been more persuasive with a stronger call to action or a clearer explanation of how individuals can implement the proposed solution in their own lives.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,3291,16906,19333,340,6780,361,4346,3418,28710,2669,15349,521,27450,3884,28723,22031,28764,28733,28728,607,28725,16906,8477,28764,1289,543,284,8286,473,8616,883,28723,2316,26260,28725,21401,11109,363,677,1514,15336,1549,4346,1514,11140,2669,954,5082,267,521,22506,28721,28797,28725,277,28742,374,305,28742,28716,2023,28725,8273,934,484,581,496,2110,28723,550,607,298,2343,462,24349,2422,305,28742,23524,28725,8273,934,7944,485,28725,526,28742,3222,7944,11571,28725,16906,549,266,490,28764,28723,1618,3127,440,28725,16906,3557,331,28764,1847,440,543,1595,19289,11594,1651,2505,1217,28725,521,319,2737,21982,340,285,383,2110,3127,340,543,997,1240,2110,28723,550,607,28705,28876,2097,481,990,3228,28725,1253,8273,307,28742,374,23800,3557,17310,2110,28723,550,607,1493,5224,28764,526,28742,3222,934,462,635,269,3913,543,1595,19289,11594,1651,911,543,284,8286,473,28725,911,9628,28725,2144,543,1595,19289,11594,1651,23473,485,28725,28705,10456,2669,484,581,496,263,543,284,8286,473,28723,3291,290,28742,17788,1651,28723,2332,391,356,7358,267,462,3127,1415,28541,28725,356,1170,14455,16065,481,10274,12974,28725,543,290,1785,1685,412,28723,15540,3264,19571,267,1289,543,1493,5224,28725,634,1595,19289,11594,4030,8175,28718,6682,5497,544,383,4473,28723,16549,11631,28725,462,284,2908,634,1102,26712,697,3763,5107,28728,4473,2669,1514,3346,373,1190,28725,2669,1514,1488,1685,1289,17724,3807,10441,1102,26712,352,28723,475,28742,1585,19477,8738,313,28797,340,1424,4110,481,1633,521,18874,8158,3025,14632,340,435,3557,484,581,496,263,1514,284,8286,1303,21105,8821,28546,28725,5359,2505,11387,536,340,1957,1685,634,22522,2804,307,28742,1642,1238,3466,305,28742,9598,911,3466,543,1102,26712,352,1397,28840,19732,28723,12494,27450,3884,28725,2422,543,284,8286,473,28725,16906,932,311,864,28764,543,284,2959,570,28725,268,28742,1061,416,9628,28725,2218,16906,19411,2422,4128,4014,26704,28723,475,28742,1585,2881,412,340,15349,521,319,22487,2505,484,3873,270,28725,277,28742,374,1326,284,8286,473,603,266,28723,16549,461,28742,1585,3557,6125,340,937,26316,28725,2218,637,278,3557,12090,543,12971,1011,10008,28723,3291,8738,547,340,305,28742,28797,2097,360,28723,3291,277,489,25515,317,1554,28725,2218,16086,28713,543,2082,473,28725,462,519,961,28725,2218,290,5560,909,28725,2218,26035,8987,267,462,484,3873,270,28725,2218,528,285,607,28725,12986,17071,3150,1555,28725,13051,24502,28725,461,28742,1585,7414,15221,462,319,22487,940,28722,1022,28723,15540,528,3247,28725,634,9276,28728,8668,28725,1326,28541,2669,543,261,9892,28725,277,28742,374,521,12631,6702,543,1908,278,23455,28723,3291,18707,631,543,7944,485,937,3186,28723,12494,3025,290,28742,501,28797,25848,28725,3670,307,28742,374,3557,521,319,22487,28725,5359,543,7222,3160,1373,340,305,28742,23524,340,543,284,8286,473,28723,1700,937,3186,934,462,968,24265,955,2218,18707,631,1289,2306,14615,263,911,3025,528,14632,1947,340,4900,263,543,7222,3160,1373,340,305,28742,23524,28723,15540,277,4403,28725,2218,3264,1065,1053,1289,634,287,1053,4155,28712,4652,2785,28725,7222,3160,1373,340,305,28742,992,28725,7222,3160,1373,1415,8061,28725,1997,309,3974,340,305,28742,992,28725,3466,16921,462,8581,340,2798,28710,9603,28723,1618,940,455,24265,28725,461,28742,1585,21090,28797,634,5972,1238,1147,2219,284,8286,473,481,12573,5174,28723,3291,757,1554,13086,6085,263,543,7222,3160,1373,28725,5972,8792,911,543,623,3160,1373,4900,263,28723,12494,3025,528,14632,340,2306,14615,263,462,24515,324,968,24265,28723,2332,391,2218,305,28742,1585,28725,2218,757,1554,13086,7414,343,462,2470,1910,28245,2669,484,581,496,263,1514,12444,1126,28723,13542,2218,17724,441,940,462,2470,340,3670,17724,28718,440,13255,28725,305,28742,10750,572,28725,462,20822,281,28742,17788,28709,5174,911,940,543,10274,8778,28725,305,28742,10750,572,427,1147,305,28742,24825,14482,28723,320,406,462,15004,934,3036,28723,13542,27462,2218,3264,1065,278,28725,4709,733,28748,16289,28793,17158,356,272,2078,1203,2489,28725,315,682,4338,272,14861,293,9992,302,272,8666,390,28705,28781,28723,415,17153,11466,6098,16468,497,304,8809,13809,298,18887,559,2928,684,3408,21088,304,272,9545,302,7484,272,1489,13405,354,20256,6313,2130,28723,2584,24685,349,835,3081,304,16441,390,630,15157,272,5132,1444,272,26945,302,1982,9923,
