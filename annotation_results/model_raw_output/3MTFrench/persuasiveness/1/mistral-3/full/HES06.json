{"model":"mistral","created_at":"2024-04-07T10:28:19.847198303Z","response":" Based on the given transcript and the persuasive dimension description, I would rate the persuasiveness of this speech as a 4. The speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by sharing a relatable story of someone making a costly mistake in business, and then explaining how her research aims to prevent similar mistakes in the future. Her reasoning is also rigorous, as she outlines her methodology for identifying hidden costs and building a model to address these issues. However, there are some parts of the speech that could be clearer or more succinct, which slightly reduces its persuasiveness score.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,14527,462,13150,267,340,6960,26289,28725,2218,290,13139,634,3913,19797,2505,1921,4652,28891,631,28733,1014,324,911,340,3559,522,1289,27424,28723,2661,337,264,347,14158,14245,281,28742,370,340,11844,3913,19797,28725,461,28742,1585,6419,11693,28797,1361,4652,13165,521,264,631,424,324,911,1521,290,28742,28708,6567,677,28797,3670,526,28742,309,6783,934,4266,28797,28723,1700,268,8882,1415,11408,755,297,3762,1651,28723,1361,4652,13165,264,7166,5685,281,28742,1344,360,462,19341,11408,755,2669,462,2372,7380,28723,935,2308,28711,6813,324,6783,8395,28797,28705,28783,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,317,22751,28725,521,20638,2308,28711,6813,324,6783,8395,28797,28705,28740,28734,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,317,22751,28725,12986,5086,1233,28721,883,1361,4652,13165,264,2183,10867,20948,3025,6783,8395,1022,28705,28783,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,317,22751,28725,19255,12811,16700,15349,2219,7944,485,2211,5731,28723,16549,3670,955,1361,4652,13165,307,28742,494,1022,3557,15053,363,441,28723,334,28742,374,543,4630,3974,1415,11408,755,3025,818,28714,3580,1514,6002,1189,9603,911,277,28742,23133,16018,361,4346,462,318,1182,28797,28723,12494,5497,1514,6935,363,497,3025,435,268,28742,321,783,2487,3557,911,3025,6205,12599,1514,6819,1289,543,379,1352,8462,28723,334,28742,374,543,660,424,340,484,2728,267,281,28742,2146,10024,3025,10979,24087,1415,6727,634,597,4854,282,12035,911,6719,28733,28753,4550,1361,4652,13165,307,28742,494,1022,3557,724,8507,28718,28705,10456,28723,2316,358,955,28705,10456,3670,307,28742,374,3557,724,8507,28718,2422,1514,11408,23029,911,1514,575,4544,634,264,338,1449,911,481,3285,277,28742,374,15053,2800,294,546,1289,484,335,898,263,28723,976,734,4517,2265,263,1514,484,14779,28804,13542,9628,277,28742,374,28705,10456,305,28742,2814,335,340,4128,306,26289,28723,3291,11716,278,521,968,24265,10637,281,28742,20044,1514,2506,782,1717,15300,911,1514,2506,782,277,595,1442,911,2218,11716,278,3670,968,24265,2422,2219,3913,9266,2505,6578,340,2372,1289,28705,10456,28723,330,2704,2219,13138,362,350,7851,340,26590,631,28725,20288,28725,2300,1082,2959,15663,481,1610,7971,2110,1147,462,968,24265,1859,691,28733,26390,294,26601,28797,940,1514,1957,9892,1726,28725,637,363,973,28725,264,488,4473,28725,2058,5560,2959,497,911,1514,17729,18707,631,1726,340,305,28742,17218,271,28723,3291,16906,1949,1651,28723,475,28742,1646,311,490,634,264,631,424,1726,634,3559,2561,1289,28705,10456,634,25090,19371,28723,3291,10441,1493,5224,911,2218,5902,28706,634,5227,697,4109,279,5087,28725,4664,279,5087,4552,28710,9603,28723,475,28742,28149,331,4346,3418,28710,543,25715,5308,267,298,28710,28725,462,305,536,28705,10456,2669,11716,536,1326,968,24265,28723,4603,4550,1289,8821,1289,3670,968,24265,28723,334,28742,374,3913,9266,8403,2237,4536,12761,263,1415,9877,575,309,10637,281,28742,20044,1514,26336,1147,1514,2506,28714,815,1053,340,28541,911,1147,305,28742,8974,5463,1147,462,28541,28723,13542,2218,16906,1424,28713,462,1448,262,2422,543,854,361,28723,3291,1776,278,521,968,24265,1859,691,28733,26390,294,3588,936,8090,28725,25386,1514,3913,19797,7286,16065,1514,3345,1289,28705,10456,28725,634,2545,3378,340,6388,278,281,28742,28797,638,28725,2058,2561,281,28742,20044,28725,2306,28714,572,274,1289,28705,10456,28725,305,28742,10750,572,1147,1514,4331,340,28541,911,1147,305,28742,8974,5463,28723,13542,28705,10456,28725,16906,7414,20650,3557,955,28705,10456,4536,2265,263,1514,4331,340,11198,2505,28541,28723,4709,733,28748,16289,28793,17158,356,272,2078,1203,2489,304,272,14861,293,495,9711,5436,28725,315,682,4338,272,14861,293,9992,302,456,8666,390,264,28705,28781,28723,415,17153,11466,9949,28713,264,4221,26455,2928,486,10681,264,1016,18671,2838,302,2493,2492,264,2434,346,11990,297,1955,28725,304,868,20400,910,559,3332,20566,298,5297,3684,17179,297,272,3437,28723,2584,24685,349,835,10536,15138,28725,390,630,575,8063,559,2038,2161,354,21653,7918,6966,304,3667,264,2229,298,2962,1167,4382,28723,2993,28725,736,460,741,5099,302,272,8666,369,829,347,3081,263,442,680,13614,5654,28725,690,7191,21123,871,14861,293,9992,7420,28723],"total_duration":79918982934,"load_duration":177008,"prompt_eval_count":686,"prompt_eval_duration":63802387000,"eval_count":125,"eval_duration":16116026000}
