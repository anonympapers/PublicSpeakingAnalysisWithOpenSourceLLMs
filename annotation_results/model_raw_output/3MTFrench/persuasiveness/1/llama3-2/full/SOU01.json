They use a mix of scientific jargon and colloquialisms to engage the audience and make the topic of forensic science accessible. The speech is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is generally rigorous, using logical connections between ideas to build their argument. They provide examples and anecdotes to illustrate complex concepts, making them easier to understand.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the persuasiveness could be improved:\n\n1. **Repetition:** The speaker repeats themselves multiple times, which can make the message feel repetitive or even tedious at times.\n2. **Lack of concrete evidence:** While the speaker presents their method as revolutionary and effective, they don't provide concrete examples or case studies to support their claims.\n3. **Emotional appeal:** The speech could benefit from a stronger emotional appeal to engage the audience on a deeper level. While the speaker's passion for chemistry is evident, it might not be enough to carry the entire message.\n\nOverall, the speaker demonstrates strong persuasive skills, but there are areas where they can improve to make their message even more compelling and effective.\n\n**Transcript:**\n\nThe crime has been committed. Tonight, we're going to investigate with a new method that will reveal fingerprints. We'll start by gathering evidence, not just any kind of evidence, but the kind that will lead us to the perpetrator.\n\nWe'll use a technique called spraying with a reagent that reacts with superglue. This will create long, thin fibers that can be used to visualize what was previously invisible. By adding color to our fibers, we'll have the perfect solution for viewing fingerprints.\n\nAmong these molecules, Bodipin is chosen as the star of fingerprint revelation. Under the light, our molecules reveal themselves without 20 meters of distance from the luminescence in the fingerprint patterns. Outside of these patterns, Bodipin is silent; it's no longer expressed. Suddenly, a reveled vision of our fingerprints becomes possible.\n\nBut the extraordinary properties of this molecule don't stop at color, for with it, an analysis that was previously impossible becomes possible. And tonight, without having found the perpetrator, we've revealed the fingerprints that will lead us to his identity - a child's game in complete darkness.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,9977,264,24560,470,648,13,8242,1339,3846,1744,308,17771,514,88486,324,7010,514,40828,9952,514,35641,409,326,6,107427,11,3900,308,59858,264,934,22827,74206,91116,409,3625,47929,1880,3846,57992,17317,682,2439,296,804,326,41901,447,37093,13,356,17771,79988,11,4864,9189,30714,409,628,647,261,9952,41091,7010,514,38900,15550,86396,409,1208,1589,61334,38469,13,27058,65385,261,29449,77807,37093,11,3900,841,47090,16968,294,6,370,541,46524,951,864,84,2396,11,10071,6502,294,22827,60172,2922,31769,43014,13,24703,7930,17317,57110,22550,3846,57992,11,3846,15132,3625,991,1762,396,288,16099,3916,13,7695,379,264,4538,961,90053,409,17317,11,9621,1880,76776,30547,13,34447,46939,11,3869,42067,9888,51625,285,11,4864,36731,97717,1744,9189,47592,26725,665,83067,3625,463,1056,285,7330,333,8467,409,6316,47528,3869,513,20028,35597,951,11909,13,51223,85,19010,8047,951,991,1762,396,288,11,15878,16968,3869,3044,1685,593,9120,278,13,507,2005,13,34447,35597,9189,9189,259,1188,11,8641,89,1370,15265,74206,57351,11,917,43711,12575,68,1765,3625,842,299,1220,6033,56311,513,46524,13,12535,682,2439,5392,788,39587,13988,978,1126,5019,46524,40744,3625,991,1762,396,288,294,31109,1156,48099,409,9977,11,28463,14240,519,3930,1744,1208,71632,6033,17317,17317,26483,85,2439,3846,57992,13,19421,1208,55133,14896,7930,9189,86100,259,1992,11,272,17771,1208,18694,513,281,2182,1744,326,54386,17537,2428,3869,326,26248,579,294,22827,281,1736,2933,13,24082,479,11,42138,39929,100162,45889,35483,7010,3625,842,299,1220,1744,9189,11,9189,9189,9517,971,9667,11,9189,513,9517,66,408,2439,951,31837,20624,9484,265,934,31109,49586,3869,294,39982,978,15564,1826,12266,3869,20662,15105,13,7591,21200,42625,11,29449,77807,37093,281,3978,483,13,356,17771,3869,3846,4545,1744,503,55624,651,1188,13,3341,20028,1860,11967,326,41901,447,37093,11,272,17771,514,42775,1744,503,34155,9395,978,409,2018,8977,294,41901,71751,653,46494,11,6033,326,41901,3841,84,1880,294,6,14283,38094,648,1880,1589,61334,38469,13,19421,5019,46524,40744,27750,991,501,21938,11,4864,52895,375,6316,48659,98652,409,9517,52274,2354,1744,503,98279,24281,89,32592,57128,409,993,22550,13,33150,48226,6496,409,829,17028,978,409,7710,11,3846,72601,12025,1791,648,11,513,42182,23761,294,81979,1880,294,31109,31914,582,13109,2579,412,481,5019,439,716,1414,100198,409,326,6,77217,1765,3663,13,34447,7010,514,27584,27138,11,4864,51441,31807,3023,265,653,83195,80259,409,38094,648,13,1369,360,17156,579,324,665,9621,951,991,501,1771,11,16968,665,30179,651,519,1208,423,69248,13,64105,64,10390,1395,14707,11,503,34155,6316,11939,7010,1208,17536,7015,3416,818,12303,13,435,12267,409,1208,38094,648,4502,9189,27389,59958,23577,13,19421,3846,57992,11,4864,9189,30714,409,9765,462,16339,951,912,2552,13,48109,682,2439,5019,45602,23761,42587,978,665,23749,9952,653,9517,533,333,7930,4612,68,76776,409,1208,2307,6200,361,13,19421,20662,34922,11,514,3729,951,1589,4558,2392,409,326,41901,59976,265,11412,4846,409,1317,361,11,1488,1880,665,57128,409,993,16094,10515,333,13,432,29293,9621,3846,7930,43989,45575,30547,3869,12155,20043,2249,13,34447,15878,308,59858,9189,2107,4893,409,46131,1529,276,1765,64347,13,29469,292,458,308,17771,6502,13,445,6,1662,412,294,31109,76651,3869,12155,993,16094,10515,285,11,17317,14240,391,1415,45575,22299,3625,10105,1370,3716,635,5019,46131,12155,991,501,21938,13,19421,14951,8646,3625,22337,20243,2482,39723,9189,665,5804,72,408,23577,272,17771,14707,1208,348,2328,294,22827,38094,17194,13,56744,72,27750,22337,20243,2482,11,45702,92021,11,27750,4538,2439,11,264,24560,2665,13532,5019,23761,1208,29033,6672,409,1208,9517,52274,2354,294,98146,652,3935,13,89578,514,20272,951,2447,38647,29449,22337,20243,2482,1744,17317,57038,55162,10036,1344,261,978,15878,409,220,508,296,75104,409,1208,41263,20712,7010,3625,84989,409,326,98146,652,3935,13,34447,60475,409,27750,84989,11,45702,92021,1826,16968,11,27549,841,274,6,9600,547,5636,11,27549,274,17771,653,13,432,29293,16968,3869,16081,3284,6316,11376,9517,85,8047,409,12155,991,652,3935,13,34447,3625,21744,10515,5512,64555,17724,409,20662,22337,20243,2957,841,513,4017,306,6502,3869,409,1208,76651,11,1841,9952,27549,11,6316,49586,264,294,6,32453,479,308,98146,782,82,1260,13,19421,3846,57992,11,3869,47371,2784,294,49152,13603,100162,514,86032,30808,11,9517,85,29982,951,991,652,359,2392,22059,447,5512,409,4538,9859,409,3567,1188,653,51655,294,41901,
