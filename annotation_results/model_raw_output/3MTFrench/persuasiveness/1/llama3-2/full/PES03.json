{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T22:41:57.693463814Z","response":"**DIMENSION:** Persuasive (Score: 8/10)\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using personal anecdotes, scientific evidence, and historical context to make their point. They begin by sharing a story about their grandmother's advice to use urine as fertilizer, which sets the tone for a conversation about circular economy and sustainability.\n\nThroughout the speech, the speaker uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"la gestion des expressions humaines\"), metaphors (\"le cycle de la zotte\"), and humor (the example of making baguettes with urine) to engage their audience. They also provide concrete examples, like the 50% recycling rate in Paris a century ago, which helps to illustrate the point.\n\nThe speech is well-structured, starting with a clear thesis statement (\"Ma thèse, je crois les résultats de différentes disciplines scientifiques pour analyser la gestion des expressions humaines.\") and building up to a call to action (\"Comment faire en pratique ?\").\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the speaker could improve:\n\n1. **Transitions:** The speech feels a bit disjointed at times, with abrupt transitions between ideas. More seamless connections between sentences and paragraphs would help to create a smoother flow.\n2. **Emotional appeal:** While the speaker's personal anecdote is engaging, they don't quite tap into the audience's emotions as much as they could have. Adding more emotional appeals or stories about people affected by poor waste management might make the message more compelling.\n\nOverall, the speech is well-received, and the speaker effectively conveys their message with a mix of humor, storytelling, and scientific evidence.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,3869,326,6,6581,295,24547,72,1765,326,6,277,1936,277,1395,13,29179,321,6496,3846,1744,7631,1339,7643,6800,1474,12339,3869,27750,86696,60404,13,65381,326,31769,5481,593,11,4864,841,9517,44811,2852,23423,978,1744,503,65948,2852,20028,409,1208,38317,1765,514,24547,72,13,19421,76776,11,4864,308,6,4202,2192,56316,43306,978,1744,1370,20662,95234,11,7643,6800,1474,12339,5899,1339,25692,85815,6316,35881,1169,409,1208,9320,91329,1640,2428,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,14425,285,3625,100246,409,96642,49255,7330,333,8467,5019,969,8678,805,1208,59471,951,24282,2854,33903,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,4571,72,38469,3930,34922,2854,467,20605,265,1744,272,17771,1370,3625,4433,1572,1744,514,34922,51913,582,3159,1208,3682,13109,294,6,10610,80381,3904,11,1208,81098,951,1760,978,1572,11,3625,19637,645,1332,76743,2249,22299,514,2267,1892,12108,6033,514,3273,339,367,13,5034,6800,1474,12339,27549,17317,20605,265,1744,3625,6136,288,513,46798,81,79738,1120,1133,409,27750,46798,6417,812,11,1880,1744,326,6,324,483,1826,653,9250,76185,13,2998,5589,11,3625,7135,80463,20605,8135,2107,2850,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,11,653,951,1665,22589,21901,2908,12249,409,1208,59471,409,326,77025,745,1362,2854,8511,43989,409,14448,12329,3625,4433,1572,5019,30870,566,261,3846,11008,409,10184,6417,812,13,19421,44829,11,8065,220,508,68,97739,9326,11,1208,281,10515,299,331,318,648,1826,69003,978,13,1952,274,17771,5906,3869,43998,10515,12329,951,459,33050,25108,331,318,8467,3869,6800,21430,4057,294,6,67229,55893,554,26495,458,1880,3625,4433,1572,2854,33903,15132,409,46469,304,332,3742,13,4366,1208,27306,668,3869,523,13559,294,93847,1880,514,16968,682,1339,733,60768,11,389,3625,264,17004,978,3869,1208,44229,20712,13,5034,60128,409,326,93847,951,436,33920,31539,1826,409,1055,84,35205,22761,2428,11,45575,389,264,1913,72,1370,19477,52750,951,603,1572,294,31769,79,2060,13,34447,665,18027,519,3625,8065,1773,20243,13649,11,27750,603,1572,841,1370,10176,89810,6502,3869,79196,52424,326,6,526,14687,3869,1167,354,466,409,12155,4433,1572,13,3489,6853,4824,53410,4502,389,14448,1082,1880,326,6,324,483,409,26725,3625,14464,1821,409,326,6,351,6200,316,53301,41958,26584,5019,36214,12329,3930,1529,978,11,389,92215,2558,556,220,914,11990,409,9145,14127,2392,409,6784,1370,9880,1880,5019,61512,11,75804,88253,7010,20662,945,6200,316,53301,11,514,9637,2249,409,92465,425,409,326,6,1394,1295,308,17771,1744,409,220,20,4,45575,934,35329,43989,294,41901,2842,220,1135,4,3900,379,264,653,97739,9326,13,1952,264,68866,978,653,72601,10006,978,12267,1880,7230,28674,7010,514,43014,389,54206,951,81336,15433,1821,72070,5512,1880,389,3625,7591,376,3159,409,326,49455,265,13,27058,27389,4120,3625,94527,4046,447,9100,5911,276,7211,17724,11,3900,2267,664,14687,38831,15170,6316,59471,4319,74775,951,4433,1572,13,12095,9189,47592,653,91399,11,9189,45366,46932,265,514,31025,321,409,7643,6800,1474,12339,1880,36214,12329,15265,2109,354,1435,3869,326,6,324,483,13,34447,7930,11,294,6,40997,17317,27981,306,4538,1529,978,1880,20272,4538,6784,7010,29449,77824,16036,285,8047,39723,326,54386,1179,68,326,6,10610,332,13283,7010,1208,39973,11,3900,2267,664,14687,2942,12329,514,54606,409,27750,10184,6417,812,5553,3625,27833,13,12535,20028,665,95234,949,19421,14707,11,41199,1208,27306,668,3869,19266,36235,294,6,324,483,11,55398,6,2933,13988,15433,978,409,89714,5019,665,20028,653,76185,91329,1640,2428,11,503,34155,81621,665,5891,361,653,6800,13026,409,12823,7930,3073,306,46939,46838,494,2852,653,951,665,3841,2249,21901,2908,12249,1880,294,6,44803,805,1880,409,58673,15610,1765,3625,4787,65207,82653,8467,1880,7829,75,645,7930,29557,376,546,409,30870,566,261,3846,11008,409,1208,1167,51111,13,2998,30179,812,220,605,8261,11,665,220,18,4520,11,503,6,25632,12339,4799,12329,6316,55133,3044,1208,85424,409,42563,1744,20662,9320,91329,1640,2428,513,28068,68,28463,7010,29449,27306,668,13,25145,72,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,76219,24557,68063,21097,84,27645,320,10793,25,220,23,14,605,340,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,4443,94066,11,12624,6029,11,323,13970,2317,311,1304,872,1486,13,2435,3240,555,11821,264,3446,922,872,39284,596,9650,311,1005,40335,439,65391,11,902,7437,279,16630,369,264,10652,922,28029,8752,323,41329,627,198,60105,279,8982,11,279,19114,5829,87068,7766,1778,439,54515,3573,4355,59471,951,24282,2854,33903,4063,31768,1105,3573,273,11008,40
