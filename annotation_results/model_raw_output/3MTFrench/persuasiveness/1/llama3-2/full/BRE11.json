They effectively use metaphors (\"souris\" = mice) and analogies (\"camouflage\" the glioblastoma cells) to explain complex concepts in an accessible way.\n\nThe reasoning is rigorous, and the speaker presents a clear plan for developing their \"piege\" (trap). The use of specific examples and data from studies adds credibility to their argument. However, some listeners may find the analogy and metaphors somewhat forced or overly simplistic, which might detract from the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:** (Translated from French)\n\n\"I have very bad news. Your house is infested with mice. They're everywhere. So what do you do? Do you, like the enemies of Medjugorie, clean out your entire house? But remember, the end of the episode, the mouse is always there. Where are you going to trap each of the mice and eliminate them one by one? Some mice will always be left over. Then, surely, you'll think about buying a mousetrap. But can we apply this simple reasoning to the fight against cancer? When chemotherapy, which casts its shadow everywhere and targeted therapy doesn't work, couldn't we use a mousetrap? The goal of my thesis is to turn this idea into reality. My mouse is glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive brain cancer that neither surgery, nor radiation therapy, nor chemotherapy can completely eliminate. The first step has been developed the structure of this trap. We want it to be camouflaged, it must therefore resemble the brain as much as possible. I used its main component, hyaluronic acid, which you find everywhere in the body. The problem is that it degrades quickly. It needs to stay long enough in the brain for the glioblastoma cells to migrate into the trap. I mixed it with silk fibers from silkworms and created a micro-foam sponge material, allowing for the migration of penetrated cells. The second step is identifying a target. Studies have shown that Glioblastoma cells responsible for the recurrence of cancer after treatment are attracted by the SDF1 protein. So I loaded my sponge with this little cheese for Glioblastoma. The idea is to set up a trap, and then leave it in place for the surgeon to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Our trap has caught on time, the infiltrated cell that the surgeon can't remove. There's still a lot to do before this trap becomes functional, and we don't know yet what will be most effective at eliminating the captured cells. But maybe one day, thanks to it, you'll be able to say: I have very good news. You no longer have mice in your house.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,6316,25945,60014,85,4105,48659,13,650,52262,47276,1826,4225,478,8047,409,20897,285,13,4072,645,15132,961,412,13,1708,1105,11,934,81991,3625,9189,20028,949,1708,41881,45325,11,3869,326,78337,951,274,41901,318,1441,409,3344,48802,35285,11,1370,29005,713,294,93825,43905,15265,47276,13,34447,5945,1055,10333,45325,11,1208,1913,409,326,31769,79,6686,11,1208,20897,4618,1826,44093,39015,13,507,15273,12584,89,45325,96308,274,59858,1529,8047,95917,2957,951,20897,285,1880,3625,4046,4763,1572,1880,3625,577,308,6,60917,12416,3625,46106,13,34447,3738,288,20897,285,9189,1880,46777,1486,44093,13,1708,1105,11,78705,55755,11,9189,23423,34886,3869,48908,99490,653,70477,713,3869,20897,285,13,34447,1765,1880,57375,3284,294,53149,98343,3846,4382,6503,91080,3869,1208,63922,668,45973,514,9572,949,445,1105,593,1208,523,483,305,822,339,978,4714,648,11,7930,69524,43905,1765,4538,21765,1880,1208,76680,4714,648,272,1260,1880,841,34501,818,6502,11,841,5019,7379,89,5392,788,6502,75144,653,70477,713,3869,9964,757,1759,13,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,409,43678,20662,887,8047,665,59157,13109,13,11583,20897,285,11,272,17771,514,29032,677,4354,638,11,653,9572,3930,272,5976,2933,54008,67882,945,676,333,11,1744,13080,1208,71546,5673,648,11,13080,1208,12164,354,978,4714,648,11,13080,1208,523,483,11345,978,4714,648,11,841,56311,4046,4763,10670,4684,4558,79507,13,5034,55133,14240,2070,264,24560,7591,14717,414,8047,1208,6070,409,3846,70477,713,13,48109,348,11206,2439,934,85217,779,1188,6730,263,1517,5512,11,3900,42182,39587,594,36501,8065,7340,8065,272,5976,2933,13,622,34155,39587,42587,978,829,40321,5048,7546,1604,11,1208,272,579,305,532,75,414,263,2428,13,41621,3665,89,3846,40321,978,1744,326,54386,38831,83384,961,412,7010,3625,34280,3095,757,22011,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,934,35329,513,7591,6902,361,83457,13,7695,47090,934,35329,66167,8657,285,64656,1317,67380,7010,514,272,5976,2933,11,5019,1208,74333,28463,326,31109,514,27138,409,9971,261,7010,514,70477,713,13,14465,326,34155,39587,32118,5317,978,3869,409,1208,57525,10264,361,409,779,285,11,54206,1370,3625,72567,300,779,285,11,1880,4864,3625,16796,42587,978,5019,75831,6316,8162,12,978,37354,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,653,5634,28154,2933,64592,1517,978,3055,11,9952,951,20946,29557,61512,28463,326,6,360,66,11967,54149,951,281,32453,376,5512,13,5034,26633,90272,14240,2070,11,7010,3625,326,6,370,2530,811,294,98146,2554,4558,4282,11,272,17771,14707,97717,294,6,16288,653,308,18826,13,3959,14240,29246,14848,1647,376,978,1744,3625,2849,2482,409,480,747,677,4354,638,4294,4893,409,1208,9517,680,277,684,3930,9572,42138,89714,15132,1651,404,14014,1370,6316,1760,978,483,3869,28800,3625,328,5375,16,13,622,34155,39587,5714,978,1647,4046,37354,409,3846,46110,505,425,3869,480,747,677,4354,638,13,445,27688,8047,1826,294,22827,3197,951,274,10515,295,2439,11,389,264,934,81991,83457,1880,1208,74333,1370,514,71546,5673,3675,11,42138,934,35329,1826,82779,978,514,7340,409,1208,15756,554,13,44564,70477,713,264,45712,978,3869,326,6,75876,11,326,17771,2849,1130,43364,8047,7010,514,272,5976,2933,1744,514,71546,5673,3675,841,25692,6502,82779,261,13,7695,66167,48488,6502,20028,5019,1744,3846,70477,713,1826,3869,34501,8301,11,1880,17317,841,11427,2439,6502,35597,75804,88253,3846,7930,35737,514,5636,31914,580,5019,4046,4763,10670,3625,2849,2482,6563,324,14014,13,34447,25692,85815,934,22827,9880,11,77433,3869,25400,11,389,5019,969,665,5589,13510,11,503,34155,6316,25945,51651,48659,13,41621,308,6,52659,5636,409,20897,285,7010,15265,47276,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,76219,24557,1294,68063,220,23,14,605,198,791,19114,374,66343,304,872,5811,11,1701,264,11782,56203,311,19678,279,7434,315,11039,9572,449,264,330,20898,713,1,320,57014,8,323,11689,279,11700,1555,279,3463,1920,4920,872,17850,13,2435,13750,1005,31768,1105,3573,82,414,285,1,284,24548,8,323,24291,552,3573,11860,73331,1,279,29032,677,4354,7942,7917,8,311,10552,6485,19476,304,459,15987,1648,627,198,791,33811,374,47999,11,323,279,19114,18911,264,2867,3197,369,11469,872,330,20898,713,1,320,57014,570,578,1005,315,3230,10507,323,828,505,7978,11621,38769,311,872,5811,13,4452,11,1063,24475,1253,1505,279,56203,323,31768,1105,14738,9770,477,39532,78630,11,902,2643,35453,533,505,279,8244,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,382,9,9,49873,25823,68063,320,82116,505,8753,696,7189,617,1633,3958,3754,13,4718,3838,37
