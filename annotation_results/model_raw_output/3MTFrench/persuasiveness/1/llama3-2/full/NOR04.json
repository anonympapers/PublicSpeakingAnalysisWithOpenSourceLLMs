The shortage of resources like water and land makes it even more challenging.\n\nThat's where insects come in - they might just be the solution! üêúüçî\n\nSome people might raise eyebrows at first, but insects are a nutritious and sustainable food source. They're already being farmed on a large scale and could become a viable alternative to traditional livestock farming.\n\nInsects have a higher protein-to-weight ratio than many other animal products, making them an attractive option for those looking to reduce their environmental impact. Plus, they require significantly less land, water, and feed than traditional livestock, producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions in the process.\n\nNow, about the potential concerns around eating insects - especially among children. ü§î\n\nYou're right; kids might initially be grossed out by the idea of consuming creepy-crawlies, but that's normal. Children tend to be more curious and open-minded than adults, which can actually work in our favor when introducing them to new foods.\n\nI've conducted interviews with children aged 6-12 to better understand their perceptions of eating insects. By doing so, I hope to identify the underlying psychological, social, and cultural factors that influence their attitudes towards entomophagy (the practice of eating insects).\n\nThe goal is not only to raise awareness about the benefits of insect-based food but also to empower children with knowledge and a more open-minded approach to trying new foods.\n\nWho knows? In a few years, we might be discussing insect-based diets as a norm! üêúüåü\n\nThanks for listening; I hope this conversation has piqued your interest in the world of entomophagy!
