You're using a rather... creative approach to convey your ideas.\n\nTo summarize (if I'm not mistaken!), you're talking about how materials can behave erratically when subjected to certain conditions, such as changes in temperature or humidity. You're proposing a new tool that uses a combination of chemical, physical, and mechanical equations to predict when these changes will occur and how they might affect the material's integrity.\n\nYou're using analogies like comparing a material's behavior under stress to a person getting tired and eventually cracking under pressure (pun intended!). You're also highlighting the importance of predicting potential failures before they happen, so that we can take steps to prevent them.\n\nAm I correct in my understanding?","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,19610,45325,46939,33614,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,274,31769,1215,588,949,41621,12584,89,757,13510,653,5634,28154,2933,514,1156,10610,12339,650,4880,64,6033,3900,294,69537,541,11,10071,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,934,41901,20272,11,653,5634,28154,2933,87158,1208,24408,3757,273,409,27138,326,6,21201,11,272,17771,653,3738,4545,1880,5019,23761,15522,318,8047,22299,17317,11,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,6178,72,11,1370,51173,11,3900,379,264,653,4545,8065,1647,708,321,294,49455,337,5890,1880,294,6,1617,306,519,11,4864,282,37093,11,4864,1332,12339,11,503,6,4683,1497,653,5634,28154,2933,1880,326,6,9600,547,28463,11,3900,513,36709,1880,3900,513,95159,554,13,34447,87320,4864,9189,1370,273,409,16968,39043,949,4366,346,1744,41091,11,503,34155,9964,22011,11,4864,52895,375,653,35462,8791,458,1661,78129,934,31109,29557,409,27389,35573,514,20607,321,294,49455,337,5890,1880,514,1486,409,89869,294,22827,43453,5634,28154,2933,7930,9129,5808,514,10095,265,1880,1208,60172,294,31769,85,354,554,409,18111,324,13,46706,514,9511,67763,11,4864,42775,273,11,934,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,11,503,58736,30532,653,46110,4411,346,2933,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,4864,514,66517,18434,265,7010,653,50026,40280,39723,9189,45366,9189,38831,15170,9952,15265,81645,7010,76076,21935,11,653,7591,23772,326,6,28400,307,13109,13,4418,66,11,4864,296,1441,7010,326,93847,1880,1744,66517,326,93847,11,1208,4160,953,11,1208,7930,8175,265,11,27549,281,46651,1880,27549,281,46651,1880,1744,66517,326,6,35940,977,648,2933,1880,514,31807,17194,11,3900,308,41901,25692,5636,11,44829,1208,24408,3757,273,409,39674,5890,1880,8065,25646,294,22827,3738,4545,11,3900,46141,593,13,14465,5320,2249,13510,11,3900,95159,554,8065,5636,259,35657,11,3900,19748,265,2856,554,11,66021,1744,39043,841,513,4160,275,6502,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,11,1208,95159,554,11,66021,1744,326,49455,2428,1744,4864,52895,375,757,29557,2221,294,6,14283,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,25945,38920,409,326,6,541,265,409,8162,1474,7211,265,54401,409,757,7591,5192,404,26725,27750,1156,10610,10308,409,84364,13,34447,9604,10333,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,1744,39043,7010,1208,17536,11,66021,1744,665,5636,409,326,6,12828,307,13109,409,11323,266,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,60172,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,10095,265,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,60172,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,10095,265,1880,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,13,19421,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,13,426,1116,11,9189,326,817,89,11,9189,514,8834,27843,978,1880,39015,11,3625,95159,1439,1081,27462,3869,513,46131,1880,1208,1913,308,17771,6502,25945,78060,13,1708,1105,11,4068,20028,949,356,17771,39015,1744,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,1647,704,321,86953,1188,9952,3625,4046,447,811,409,1208,38094,648,11,64441,1880,32118,4919,2428,1744,4864,1491,616,285,7010,1647,1515,78493,11,4864,94297,45347,409,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,3869,326,31769,331,6853,18563,2445,454,2428,54401,409,27389,35573,3869,26077,4545,3625,95159,1439,7930,3073,306,294,31109,76407,304,118904,15729,15890,653,5634,28154,2933,3567,72,89810,58612,486,4881,33670,934,22827,20156,841,513,2558,1082,11,66021,1744,41091,11,4864,5320,2249,1744,39043,1913,275,14707,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,2351,4560,311,10552,264,6485,7434,922,7384,8198,323,52997,279,8060,315,7384,1234,8631,13,1472,2351,1701,264,4856,1131,11782,5603,311,20599,701,6848,627,198,1271,63179,320,333,358,2846,539,37104,49743,499,2351,7556,922,1268,7384,649,36792,1886,7167,994,38126,311,3738,4787,11,1778,439,4442,304,9499,477,38193,13,1472,2351,57515,264,502,5507,430,5829,264,10824,315,11742,11,7106,11,323,22936,39006,311,7168,994,1521,4442,690,12446,323,1268,814,2643,7958,279,3769,596,17025,627,198,2675,2351,1701,24291,552,1093,27393,264,3769,596,7865,1234,8631,311,264,1732,3794,19781,323,9778,52829,1234,7410,320,66007,10825,43492,1472,2351,1101,39686,279,12939,315,52997,4754,28950,1603,814,3621,11,779,430,584,649,1935,7504,311,5471,1124,627,198,6219,358,4495,304,856,8830,30,128009],"total_duration":6155079810,"load_duration":207417,"prompt_eval_co
