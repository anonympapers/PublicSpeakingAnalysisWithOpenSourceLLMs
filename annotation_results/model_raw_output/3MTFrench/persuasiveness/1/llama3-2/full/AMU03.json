At first, with my documents, inter-artistic things. And then one day, I participated in my first excavation site, a real revelation! The specialist who is from the department, the situation of the past, based on what we find during archaeological excavations. When you start digging, you face some questions. Our path is to discuss with people who are often worried about their future and trying to push us towards other rules. My guidance counselor at college, for example, it's a field where there aren't many job opportunities and you have to do an internship, yes. And one day, I'll leave the lab and go out into the world. Each person, man, woman, child, is an individual with their experience and marks. I've told them stories and above all, their anomalies that can sometimes indicate the presence of a particular infectious disease. And from this starting point, who am I, I've tried to estimate how much these infections represent in the health problems of ancient populations. For example, how many soldiers during the French Revolution... where my main professor is not convinced, but it's really not convincing. And you say there are deaths, and there are deaths, but I don't really have an exact science. In fact, these are sciences that work together, because sometimes, and you say that help is not sufficient. So some days, I wear a lab coat and gloves. And I try to find the causes of these infectious diseases. They are viruses or bacteria, from samples, small fragments in doses. I try to detect the DNA of these microbes. That means the genetic trace of their presence in the soil that I've collected. Sometimes, I get stuck. But the reward is when the dead people start talking to me. This quiet doesn't just happen by chance. It's only because of their bodies, it tells us about their past life. And yes, they are much more talkative than we think. Last, it's a young candidate who has been here for just a few days, but he hasn't had a job yet. Not very optimistic. This is a field that is so precarious and I don't really have any job offers to propose. To summarize all these remarks that you share with us, but the essential thing isn't the pleasure of getting up every morning to do work that we love because, after all, what's at stake is the journey, not the destination, small matter. Thank you.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,2564,3489,438,503,49152,2852,15925,514,27138,11,503,34155,59148,1653,326,6,1132,978,5673,648,13,423,6,370,541,11,9952,326,6,19010,535,11,3625,9477,958,472,14014,13,19421,44829,11,653,9880,11,503,34155,5293,978,3869,1647,21134,44453,1291,409,57625,4618,11,6316,34923,648,9517,52274,2354,409,1208,503,44886,26248,15925,934,22827,887,8047,665,83067,409,96586,5438,83391,41416,1640,1157,13,2009,76305,17194,7930,1826,3930,7591,631,11,1208,6671,3930,81621,11,264,31632,409,3846,1744,326,93825,38831,66867,8047,409,57625,4618,5438,978,848,2428,13,3489,438,503,6,6292,552,648,513,2322,83,11,389,20272,3663,3869,45889,37539,811,13,44564,45740,2530,1826,409,10430,9952,951,47104,71151,14707,11,10071,951,47104,304,47391,1441,5019,29449,264,43406,1880,7930,16006,306,409,17317,4046,70,5741,5553,294,81979,83229,86709,13,11583,31025,484,31539,294,6,25280,8065,4631,73899,11,1370,51173,11,272,17771,653,96839,39723,3900,379,264,28800,409,7591,65,3102,978,1880,3900,47090,20028,409,326,54386,9189,14240,799,11,409,326,54386,9189,14240,799,11,97507,13,19421,409,326,54386,9880,45347,8065,9511,67763,3869,3460,404,3625,1400,4558,2392,951,447,37907,934,35329,1826,27389,13570,3930,27138,7930,39904,13,921,20234,25661,10010,11,40351,11,18694,11,33632,519,11,1826,653,23496,84,11,6316,54613,9952,4538,348,20243,84,1880,15907,357,343,16862,13,622,34155,9964,22011,43153,46106,1880,76776,11,43153,75559,7930,56311,1370,86633,296,6,485,72684,1208,30179,768,294,31109,8811,329,648,4225,2635,31037,54008,20712,13,19421,409,3846,1486,409,76235,11,7930,326,6,485,65023,84,11,503,34155,9964,22011,76826,1208,9517,42098,409,27750,8811,17491,11,3869,326,31769,331,6853,951,6732,5438,978,848,8467,1880,409,43153,22673,13,2009,1080,12844,409,7643,38317,11,272,17771,409,259,1992,294,17771,1826,3212,1208,961,1744,71925,6960,27750,30020,7010,3625,52088,66474,409,77323,951,22673,459,5979,15564,13,23262,3675,11,1370,51173,11,294,6,485,65023,84,3869,27138,409,274,59858,1488,15760,11,46206,3625,6216,1900,409,1208,9517,65272,93424,11,653,44351,11,39723,326,6,292,8047,1880,1647,2848,24201,324,7546,1604,274,59858,3276,52760,3091,424,546,1826,11,10071,259,77025,60019,6502,5804,467,20811,13,19421,9964,834,3625,10237,82,11,934,35329,379,107902,951,10237,82,11,10071,4864,308,34155,6502,60019,6316,8198,4839,68,13,2998,20272,11,3846,15132,951,36788,7930,58673,484,306,409,21497,288,11,1841,1370,86633,11,1880,9964,834,1744,326,26248,579,308,17771,6502,8657,285,519,13,1708,1105,11,76076,49301,11,503,41901,56127,326,31109,97045,1880,951,342,1821,13,19421,4864,52571,3625,4294,4893,409,27750,8811,17491,4225,2635,1924,13,24703,15132,3625,17188,6033,3625,293,533,28154,14295,11,3869,31632,409,27389,3532,1133,11,409,86696,8508,9004,665,35130,13,622,6,434,61055,409,85877,440,261,326,6,1846,45,409,27750,80727,13,356,17771,3869,13510,1208,11917,78422,99188,409,1208,30179,768,409,27750,80727,7010,3625,1560,936,66692,1744,503,34155,22011,13,9424,688,11,4864,66517,523,283,2067,519,13,34447,1208,9517,5807,1137,11,272,17771,7010,1208,44229,20712,20028,89504,3625,10237,82,13,24703,523,283,295,978,841,513,1589,8047,3869,326,6,461,4618,13,356,17771,409,1370,43406,3869,15907,25912,11,71686,77433,3869,28130,34922,11,272,17771,934,35329,17317,15473,46452,409,28130,17536,81621,13,19421,97507,11,46152,15132,14707,5636,293,402,2402,7930,908,306,9952,13,423,944,20712,11,272,17771,46110,5803,266,11,10071,934,54386,274,17771,12694,6502,326,6,97675,13,24971,25945,7706,17194,13,356,17771,653,96839,19227,1001,27389,936,556,1880,4864,308,34155,6502,60019,294,6,1885,265,951,8654,385,285,9189,10045,261,13,362,424,64,1814,26725,27750,84228,14295,934,54386,28130,961,409,45165,1018,978,11,10071,326,6,434,306,13327,308,17771,6502,514,80410,409,513,28605,46777,5634,258,5019,20028,653,42775,7930,17317,11939,818,7930,17317,14464,306,1841,11,42138,16968,11,934,22827,60172,11,1208,9284,11,272,17771,514,88768,11,46110,42463,13,25145,72,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,596,264,14807,315,279,1495,1473,7189,574,10171,311,387,459,39211,16549,994,358,1047,892,13,2468,1176,11,449,856,9477,11,958,38921,4633,2574,13,1628,1243,832,1938,11,358,31408,304,856,1176,97539,2816,11,264,1972,40010,0,578,24687,889,374,505,279,9476,11,279,6671,315,279,3347,11,3196,389,1148,584,1505,2391,69637,45215,811,13,3277,499,1212,42200,11,499,3663,1063,4860,13,5751,1853,374,311,4358,449,1274,889,527,36
