However, the transition to the topic of coproduits (animal by-products) and their environmental impact is not as smooth. The speaker's use of metaphors, such as comparing the foin (hay) from the pig's stomach contents to a video game, might be confusing or amusing for some listeners.\n\nThe main argument about the importance of finding new ways to valorize animal by-products is clear and well-supported with statistics. However, the tone is somewhat informal and conversational, which may not be as effective in convincing a skeptical audience.\n\n**Rigor of reasoning:** 7/10\n\nThe speaker provides some scientific context about the properties of certain molecules and their potential health benefits. While this adds credibility to the argument, the connection between these scientific facts and the main point about valorizing animal by-products is not always explicit or well-developed.\n\nSome listeners might appreciate the creative analogies and wordplay used throughout the speech, but others may find them distracting or unprofessional. Overall, while the speaker's passion and creativity are evident, the persuasiveness of the speech could be improved with a clearer structure and more convincing evidence.\n\nPlease note that this evaluation is subjective and based on my understanding of the transcript. I'm happy to provide further feedback if you'd like!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,43989,6316,37291,3625,56321,86696,80181,2439,13,19421,14707,97507,11,220,679,24,11,272,17771,1208,38605,3930,80181,263,13,4418,66,11,29449,56321,86696,80181,2439,11,272,17771,14707,1208,7591,70,3904,7010,326,98279,1347,261,13,3489,438,16968,294,22827,16081,514,32118,11943,17317,7515,451,11,2961,10126,1880,6563,4269,64,1880,389,514,80181,263,11,514,5636,25500,11,514,5636,25165,1880,514,5636,917,10515,684,13,14465,91507,757,38682,13412,3846,11323,266,2428,13,356,17771,514,4545,4160,321,6496,13,74656,934,22827,28800,77411,11,12471,283,841,60534,6502,326,55624,978,911,278,13109,409,3625,389,645,514,80181,263,13,19421,93569,917,324,404,1208,281,46651,11,3625,389,645,11,3625,671,1354,1880,27584,1208,83067,13,41621,12584,89,757,13510,35597,934,35329,274,17771,5906,8065,326,56998,15878,3355,23775,13,19421,14707,2536,11,16968,22299,9189,11,23008,586,11,12471,283,841,60534,1744,3625,82134,4411,346,2249,3930,80181,263,13,9648,55755,22011,1208,3355,23775,13,19421,514,66167,1744,326,54386,917,6853,5636,34561,42625,3625,6293,4653,1220,15132,3625,19266,981,447,15844,13,2394,29097,8941,20117,11,3869,4545,7010,1208,59157,13109,13,2998,98676,519,1744,3625,6293,4653,1220,91678,306,11,272,17771,35597,5019,2960,3930,97418,294,22827,80181,263,13,1252,80181,263,11,281,4558,325,665,348,2534,220,1041,21647,13,19421,3869,73173,409,220,508,11990,409,1069,1759,671,1617,355,1370,459,665,9822,11,4864,9189,93569,20028,3625,5935,82,13,13789,11,4864,9189,41675,653,28800,13,356,8458,4046,30044,8065,97418,409,220,22,220,931,5041,4558,4978,12704,1157,13,64105,64,665,20272,11,951,27378,409,7591,331,1441,3869,18027,261,308,17771,6502,13,48109,3567,2439,945,404,1880,46524,409,87325,52138,729,5019,59157,12329,3625,6293,4653,1220,54401,409,9517,1072,556,326,98146,652,3935,91329,1640,2428,1880,75831,1208,51304,13,356,17771,3846,3869,75249,4864,91507,296,55624,978,676,261,7010,7643,69067,13,3206,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,46524,409,80080,4160,552,409,14448,8082,951,671,1900,409,1069,1759,11,22299,514,17258,1677,11,1208,436,69628,11,514,272,89412,6033,35597,514,282,2003,13,27058,45602,11,4864,91507,296,55624,978,676,261,7010,326,31769,34985,409,22337,20243,2482,7930,14848,951,3369,1441,84233,69,8467,5019,1208,77323,2854,8511,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,393,1466,2439,40126,326,58736,45534,3930,282,2003,13,41621,9189,5945,1055,10333,409,3846,51655,9952,3625,8755,9769,9004,1880,514,46110,7970,87713,11,12925,31251,13,19421,14707,13085,89,653,9888,1744,514,282,2003,409,326,31769,263,514,80181,263,7930,436,12333,665,1760,978,483,71925,6960,1208,12235,76701,3930,51655,12925,31251,13,12925,31251,25400,11412,100196,514,436,57332,3930,308,12341,547,1880,11412,96586,1589,625,26464,3625,1760,978,1572,3930,282,2003,13,4702,68,4068,296,6,73519,48099,11,513,38831,83384,308,8047,9952,653,8755,99757,1880,39015,11,31079,2906,11,272,17771,1208,1913,409,1208,9517,1335,665,42111,339,978,1018,648,13,4418,66,11,665,47371,2381,535,3869,1208,1913,409,1208,48901,11,17317,17317,38831,66867,2439,9952,49068,409,86696,4411,346,12249,409,1760,978,1572,1744,12925,31251,264,84788,72,3869,4020,716,13,19421,27750,86696,4411,346,12249,409,1760,978,1572,1744,326,54386,917,6853,1069,418,275,1880,14707,17317,57038,84788,72,3869,7591,1677,3696,261,934,85217,84764,1188,951,21744,10515,5512,6160,1640,8467,3869,47929,665,955,36875,333,1880,665,955,294,39982,17060,99188,13,1708,1105,11,7930,25774,846,653,9880,1744,514,282,2003,409,326,31769,263,514,80181,263,29557,30532,409,27389,43406,514,1891,370,66522,409,29449,8941,8941,59471,1880,27584,48416,8977,326,6,54203,409,7643,62851,12,1617,3059,1880,97507,11,11083,67,986,1880,11083,34872,1759,13,48109,841,514,9517,79,978,376,2439,56316,79380,11,10071,40744,1880,9517,301,1001,7970,7010,514,80181,263,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,40,3358,656,856,1888,311,15806,279,24613,300,13071,315,420,8982,382,9,9,59742,84,300,13071,68063,220,21,14,605,198,198,791,19114,8638,449,264,86605,323,1375,15436,50750,1295,922,2380,2697,49910,11,902,49155,279,10877,596,6666,13,4452,11,279,9320,311,279,8712,315,6293,4653,1220,320,48999,555,68973,8,323,872,12434,5536,374,539,439,11113,13,578,19114,596,1005,315,31768,1105,11,1778,439,27393,279,282,2003,320,68412,8,505,279,24623,596,23152,8970,311,264,2835,1847,11,2643,387,31715,477,60986,369,1063,24475,627,198,791,1925,5811,922,279,12939,315,9455,502,5627,311,14448,553,1006
