With some minor adjustments, it has the potential to be even more compelling and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,56744,72,9189,3846,57992,11,503,98279,24281,1744,9189,62299,81786,11,27549,1826,409,1055,84,665,36252,299,11,665,5951,11,6033,665,259,47789,258,6672,13,5250,332,85815,27584,409,12366,11,665,26633,76145,11,665,350,40818,11,272,17771,20272,13,4366,45973,11,4864,36731,550,37093,3869,1370,1291,1744,54613,49733,841,86100,409,1208,36679,112669,273,13,14465,326,34155,38920,36679,70,1037,3930,3148,333,8792,7930,841,4160,275,5636,81621,8065,6155,1673,13,1252,67781,11,12155,7591,64635,7591,3825,306,951,49276,47194,70720,1880,34501,36527,13,19421,4502,272,17771,83195,5019,17317,11,3625,2854,1771,11,272,17771,83195,28463,5019,3625,4039,12249,13,38891,89,1370,51173,42844,45889,1798,1821,1744,9189,62299,7591,11777,13,1708,41881,11,45575,2515,91640,11,9189,841,9189,293,5164,89,6502,665,259,47789,258,6672,98151,34395,1765,951,57677,998,17260,11,10071,9189,665,864,55506,951,3288,4918,66304,5512,6033,9189,924,535,89,951,4046,20975,5019,9189,7591,91312,13,27058,9189,11,7010,15265,8492,409,293,718,288,11,3625,4197,35933,2854,33903,11,326,6,60159,8082,11,6033,326,55624,729,2461,11,326,6,351,2265,10745,12569,68,3625,71699,7930,9189,15132,37849,1880,326,6,4202,978,708,339,20243,1640,2428,7930,29557,73468,409,3625,312,5741,13,7695,274,6,74972,45575,409,46524,951,10105,5019,68226,29557,10367,409,9517,74199,404,20662,2018,3159,978,91329,1640,2428,13,2009,436,57332,409,7643,270,4558,325,665,16968,39043,11,272,17771,294,6,391,90332,951,74282,1056,3095,1765,1208,13167,2854,8511,409,27750,10105,13,386,2727,30534,11,326,6,79060,1880,326,41901,447,37093,13,27058,326,6,79060,11,4864,2598,3527,5019,9517,16588,951,1180,38647,7930,2322,73468,653,99225,61480,27750,10105,5019,46131,3625,70175,409,68226,13,27058,326,41901,447,37093,11,4864,3625,958,299,1557,26725,23496,77776,5019,27750,7584,1238,8065,9647,13,4366,51173,11,13085,89,6316,25626,3197,40574,292,1286,272,68862,8115,12339,11,39002,8047,1370,26633,1400,1572,13952,59307,13,5034,293,12333,11,1744,9189,62299,11,264,63669,409,45347,409,326,31109,3869,326,49455,265,13,2100,333,1744,42676,9189,17782,89,8065,65385,11,9189,66651,42463,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,48488,409,4046,20975,5019,9189,272,11252,37953,409,15265,30517,8047,13,34447,9189,62299,25775,2249,11,4864,514,100164,14707,11,9189,9189,86345,89,42676,27584,13,2998,2800,519,42676,27584,10253,945,2852,11,1880,9189,47592,14707,73173,11,1841,87451,514,65385,9189,10390,1395,89,1765,653,17744,12844,7930,9189,22011,13,39783,297,59891,11,39043,25692,23761,342,28119,685,3869,16081,294,31109,1370,5997,768,409,11,10071,3900,3429,77422,1744,1208,88100,17452,5019,665,5911,81130,13,1708,1105,11,503,34155,25692,85815,9517,1517,978,331,404,13,9424,273,1435,11,9189,67807,84,535,89,15265,88768,1765,653,46110,3288,1291,66304,978,11,9189,1099,625,10333,8065,47289,27684,677,978,13,3489,438,16968,3869,16081,11,9189,264,716,346,19610,8065,78060,951,523,13559,1759,13,7777,11,39015,11,9189,20272,288,6502,3625,8811,1354,3930,16081,13,34447,9189,9189,66651,83457,42463,7930,15132,88778,5512,294,6,55565,409,9313,409,1208,7138,13,19421,934,35329,9517,1517,978,331,15760,40126,1880,6667,91640,11,10253,842,299,1220,3625,5636,4905,8699,11,5019,68226,5911,81130,951,4046,87,337,266,978,277,1220,4791,72,13,432,395,324,978,11,9189,3136,89,7591,416,5722,1880,2624,81,4558,79507,5553,1208,326,13532,12339,409,1208,369,49530,1880,9189,17782,89,409,15265,81337,13,423,22827,5634,258,11,514,14425,285,1133,409,326,6,49575,951,665,3841,2249,44351,1744,409,40744,3625,44827,409,326,6,49575,951,1180,38647,4747,5512,11,757,29557,3869,1208,37291,294,6,391,90332,951,74282,1056,3095,1765,1208,57459,665,99225,61480,409,326,91655,6814,37526,665,9822,13,19421,44767,11,951,9517,23475,3613,81,4558,2392,1880,1200,53301,8301,645,5019,3625,1180,38647,1353,12249,13,80905,39043,5019,934,6,2933,1620,11,9189,11,293,12333,11,9189,18757,1056,74466,30517,261,15265,3197,13,34447,8065,48226,6496,11,326,6,49575,3930,83229,68255,10065,44829,325,25400,28463,30517,261,20662,3197,11,6033,27584,1647,466,3869,12366,11,1880,27584,274,35329,665,264,6233,648,11,31632,951,4020,29263,514,3148,333,8792,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,76219,24557,1294,334,198,198,40,1053,4478,279,66343,2410,315,420,8982,439,220,23,704,315,220,605,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,512,198,16,13,3146,69320,287,39474,96618,578,19114,8638,555,77724,11937,304,279,10877,323,
