{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T19:19:20.925136427Z","response":"Wow, that was a long and complex video!\n\nTo summarize, the speaker is discussing the concept of planning and how it's an essential part of intelligence, especially in artificial intelligence (AI). They argue that humans are capable of predicting future events and making decisions based on those predictions.\n\nThe speaker uses their own experiences as examples. For instance, when they want to call their thesis director, they have to plan out the steps: unlocking their phone, finding the right number, etc. This process of planning is an example of projection, which involves anticipating potential outcomes and making decisions accordingly.\n\nThe speaker also mentions the importance of planning in AI, citing the example of a robot that was sent to Mars and had been functioning autonomously for 15 years before being shut down. The robot's ability to plan its actions allowed it to survive in an unpredictable environment.\n\nFinally, the speaker highlights three mechanisms that enable human planning: the \"bicude\" effect (where we rely on habits or autopilot), economies of intellectual energy (where we take the easiest solution rather than expending too much mental effort), and dynamic planning (where we adapt to changing circumstances).\n\nIt's a bit hard to follow, but I hope this summary helps!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,82405,404,2727,1744,17317,74533,26725,2107,4893,409,550,15433,556,3869,1208,96586,13,3489,6870,30,41621,841,757,272,3433,10333,6502,30,14465,91507,9189,514,7591,1677,95920,13,12095,4864,35456,82,1647,100007,22299,272,76832,1880,1744,4864,9189,4160,458,3869,41091,11,1744,11412,2442,57375,513,45347,30,4275,98676,519,6502,11,9189,55162,41881,1647,100007,11,9189,9604,10333,1370,88026,1880,25692,85815,513,272,34858,13,41621,23933,10333,39723,9189,62299,26725,2107,4893,409,27389,35573,3625,1615,978,45045,294,31109,1957,7930,841,841,829,275,6502,35597,59157,12329,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,22343,13,19421,17317,11,4864,834,934,85217,14848,20662,23878,13109,26725,3625,49301,665,54008,1291,5019,59394,951,35881,6948,13,4366,51173,11,4502,4864,5320,2249,917,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,1744,503,53149,6853,14707,4046,1325,336,479,26725,3625,49301,11,1744,42182,12,3841,20028,30,7695,47090,1744,4864,27389,13223,546,978,3625,282,3233,11,1744,4864,514,7591,424,583,4618,11,1744,503,34155,7010,1208,9517,4581,13603,11,1744,4864,52571,653,99077,7010,1208,34024,5019,665,5589,1208,12077,978,13,19421,272,76832,11,5019,46777,14240,2070,11,503,34155,20272,1744,9964,6316,22343,13,24703,1744,17317,11457,2439,409,20028,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,46524,6316,16578,294,91655,5019,93381,71933,653,1665,333,11,274,53149,6853,1208,3197,2461,1880,514,270,25253,12717,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,22425,81235,11,1208,3197,2461,1826,653,951,8106,288,28405,1045,1759,409,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,3869,1208,14175,285,409,75831,951,29807,22299,66090,63484,13,27058,66056,7930,841,514,74282,79738,6502,11,4160,3457,4905,3928,978,13,24703,12585,3154,263,638,7591,981,978,1765,21725,665,220,1049,19,264,24560,7591,6595,978,3900,379,264,45889,5347,33903,42138,220,868,65838,409,82134,4046,2032,12249,3600,1880,220,868,65838,409,3197,2461,13,24703,42844,11,5019,1744,829,3197,2461,34501,818,11,3900,47090,934,35329,513,2503,361,7010,653,50026,40280,4684,4558,79507,7591,23827,978,1880,3900,308,59858,264,6502,294,81979,6299,1744,3625,274,4558,4978,11,3154,519,13510,1744,4502,1208,348,20243,299,1082,653,48449,3675,11,45602,44521,1339,24560,4684,76366,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,294,6,14283,5636,78060,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,58673,15610,7010,653,50026,40280,18003,2428,1880,653,4635,84,13,27058,45602,11,4864,69152,653,2307,71,56771,294,39982,978,5185,324,1744,9189,4635,2852,53070,26725,514,272,5976,2933,2854,467,13,19421,665,54008,1291,11,56321,32118,4919,2191,288,13,2009,21134,11,272,17771,1208,5457,409,1208,426,292,799,13,445,1105,593,4864,7591,52274,583,285,1647,4046,73085,409,100007,11,4864,66517,934,35329,665,20272,653,40126,294,6,28400,1771,69125,1744,4864,66517,409,85722,5636,6033,40970,95103,288,13,4366,346,1744,4864,3625,16796,20272,19227,1001,409,37291,1744,4864,3625,16796,917,6091,13,2009,26633,90272,11,272,17771,326,31769,45317,648,294,31769,64374,17108,31037,13,622,6,4202,2852,18757,46524,653,49348,3197,5019,61158,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,11,1370,51173,11,665,864,52985,4538,99077,665,4799,275,11,6033,14707,665,312,45019,4538,99077,11,10071,22299,48488,409,47104,13,14465,14425,13532,11,4864,35456,82,1208,6425,1208,5636,8795,2852,5048,13,2009,8348,13532,25253,11,272,17771,1208,3197,2461,18003,2428,13,2009,38900,1826,665,6926,51913,3294,1880,4046,12821,361,15878,272,24201,13,27058,1131,7867,1438,11,1120,1133,11,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,757,61158,301,13,14465,91507,2961,5615,466,7643,3197,2461,1880,296,6,1138,5615,466,39015,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,36981,11,430,574,264,1317,323,6485,2835,4999,198,1271,63179,11,279,19114,374,25394,279,7434,315,9293,323,1268,433,596,459,7718,961,315,11478,11,5423,304,21075,11478,320,15836,570,2435,18046,430,12966,527,13171,315,52997,3938,4455,323,3339,11429,3196,389,1884,20492,627,198,791,19114,5829,872,1866,11704,439,10507,13,1789,2937,11,994,814,1390,311,1650,872,17850,7690,11,814,617,311,3197,704,279,7504,25,80478,872,4641,11,9455,279,1314,1396,11,5099,13,1115,1920,315,9293,374,459,3187,315,22343,11,902,18065,86359,4754,20124,323,3339,11429,28178,627,198,791,19114,1101,34945,279,12939,315,9293,304,15592,11,33264,279,3187,315,264,12585,430,574,3288,311,21725,323,1047,1027,31301,95103,7162,369,220,868,1667,1603,1694,9495,1523,13,578,12585,596,5845,311,3197,1202,6299,5535,433,311,18167,304,459,50235,467
