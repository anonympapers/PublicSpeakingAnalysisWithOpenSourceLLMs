You start by highlighting the importance of understanding the suspect's rights, citing the famous phrase from police dramas: \"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law...\"\n\nYou then introduce your research question: What are the rights of the suspect in criminal investigations? Your thesis aims to identify these rights and compare the situations of suspects in France and another country.\n\nThe first part of your presentation focuses on the measures that can be taken against a suspect, including private detention and 24-hour custody. You emphasize the importance of ensuring the suspect's rights are respected during this period, as they may not fully understand their situation or have access to legal representation.\n\nIn the second part of your presentation, you plan to conduct a ground-level investigation by conducting around 100 interviews with judges, prosecutors, and other stakeholders who work with suspects. You argue that understanding the experiences of these individuals is crucial for establishing a minimum standard of rights for suspects, which in turn protects our own rights as citizens.\n\nIt seems like your thesis aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the suspect's role in criminal investigations, highlighting both the similarities and differences between France and another country. Your research question has significant implications for the protection of individual rights and the fair administration of justice.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,41621,47592,514,64079,409,22641,261,514,21847,13,80905,3846,1744,9189,5534,74466,5019,1208,23761,409,259,1509,45973,9189,77558,653,63992,13,41621,47592,514,64079,665,7671,31866,11,4502,9189,308,41901,47592,6502,3625,52138,729,11,3900,9189,665,87264,1081,285,653,92860,19195,13,34447,294,22827,11083,9622,46138,11,9189,47592,26725,69379,84,20662,17571,7010,6316,47528,1499,3457,12339,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,22011,1208,54613,3869,934,85217,3625,77807,37093,1759,274,6,61375,665,27750,4751,288,7010,27750,19266,4108,13,2009,15562,13,1219,2727,514,20605,265,11,514,64160,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,3869,409,3846,15562,13,2009,15562,274,17771,38605,8376,301,978,1880,514,15562,55467,13,5034,7809,57288,409,1208,6671,3930,15562,7010,3625,26633,21935,3869,5019,326,55624,14081,49530,7330,52760,11,294,6,16288,3625,97222,409,66090,63484,1880,409,7591,23827,261,3625,44178,63934,288,1880,3625,594,28111,3095,13,27058,62998,4864,296,55624,978,22550,3869,20662,54613,425,8792,409,326,41901,447,37093,30,4366,346,1744,16968,409,11679,12339,11,514,15562,1826,15550,86396,13,356,17771,514,6730,29982,263,409,1208,13988,15433,554,281,10610,1604,13,7695,326,26248,51854,3608,35933,13,7127,2852,32592,51854,53051,811,13,7695,1826,77411,3869,48371,7218,71686,3869,1208,41263,20712,951,1495,288,409,82291,13,24703,5276,519,3869,1208,16578,409,326,41901,447,37093,11,3900,3567,1188,13,34447,665,7151,268,11,44829,26589,978,13,1708,1105,11,5019,514,60946,265,11,22299,4349,81487,11,4864,296,41901,447,37093,13,622,34155,9964,22011,3625,15285,13,423,6,370,541,11,3625,11083,1439,6223,5983,409,22848,978,10253,447,37907,3900,25692,23761,5945,34965,7010,3625,26633,21935,13,2876,64656,1208,33651,817,11,3900,379,264,409,1208,48234,13,41621,3665,89,11,20662,84921,7930,6824,68,3869,2800,261,3869,1208,46096,951,77807,37093,1759,220,1187,76145,5019,75871,265,3869,43153,4860,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,3900,1826,64284,409,326,6,5673,263,66522,951,97222,42844,27750,220,1187,76145,8065,10025,593,409,514,46131,3869,62323,1179,68,13,7695,13550,285,13,3489,438,653,3703,65,30872,75,665,3698,2259,3416,9517,283,713,11,274,6,306,99057,285,519,1370,1208,8590,10670,1880,409,85434,11,308,17771,6502,665,3698,2259,3416,11,10071,841,20272,1744,15471,38149,951,78418,12249,13,4656,978,71,978,48647,13,2998,51092,11,4864,91507,45347,3869,1208,513,95959,48901,409,7643,57485,1133,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,14465,91507,296,804,6316,77807,37093,409,88026,13,14465,91507,296,804,6316,2960,8511,294,6,2295,12184,4428,3946,11,10071,6502,1744,409,15562,13,46706,934,26248,40095,409,4983,122682,11,294,49152,511,277,11,951,48577,7930,55162,4355,1188,3625,4684,1220,11,308,6,546,6502,1208,17536,409,45347,1765,514,1099,321,13,27058,62998,1826,54312,63484,3062,949,4366,346,1744,514,15562,11,16968,22299,9189,11,16968,22299,41091,11,1826,27389,1264,978,87018,6960,13,1952,25692,26725,23761,15562,13,7695,8657,275,409,43919,2058,326,55624,14081,49530,409,1208,4379,13,1611,1370,15907,1448,978,17187,811,11,10071,25692,10539,60019,23200,261,6316,54613,3869,15907,1448,978,17187,811,11,503,59858,294,6,52659,409,25945,7970,4978,1448,978,17187,811,949,622,34155,15925,665,326,6,14310,21201,13,4366,3625,27138,7930,5590,11,3900,1826,35597,5636,4382,294,93825,15562,13,19421,8657,275,294,49152,13603,653,85182,40280,98020,653,28800,21965,19126,95710,5019,514,36963,11,81186,1208,88818,8541,685,17508,14991,11,514,342,21268,11,5019,1651,8023,1208,24408,409,1208,4379,1880,6502,1744,409,1208,4379,409,1208,3941,13,36684,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,514,4160,321,7930,17317,19266,3462,3930,15562,1826,19227,1001,296,2648,1744,3625,97222,1744,3625,15132,312,5259,355,15132,28463,3625,308,35657,417,13,4242,4558,325,11412,29557,10367,294,31769,74199,404,653,5410,8187,951,97222,3930,15562,11,294,94572,15273,12155,97222,11,409,27750,56321,15132,3625,447,37907,514,64079,665,13988,978,978,447,15729,841,25692,23761,40192,648,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,2351,32644,264,17850,389,279,7434,315,279,330,86521,1002,1,304,9337,26969,11,449,264,5357,389,279,12062,323,43874,1990,9822,323,2500,3224,320,1962,5300,570,1472,1212,555,39686,279,12939,315,8830,279,15562,596,3268,11,33264,279,11495,17571,505,4379,88826,25,330,2675,617,279,1314,311,7293,21737,13,42033,499,2019,649,387,1511,2403,499,304,264,5590,315,2383,21908,198,198,2675,1243,19678,
