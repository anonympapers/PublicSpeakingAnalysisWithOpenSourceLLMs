They explain that these products are used extensively around the world, but their effects can be devastating. The speaker shares a story about using a product called \"Trait au Kill Max\" which is very effective at killing pests, but also harms non-human consumers of crops.\n\nThe speaker notes that the molecules used in pesticides can move through waterways and contaminate fish and other aquatic animals. They mention that some of these contaminated fish are consumed by humans, which raises concerns about the health impacts.\n\nHowever, the speaker also mentions that some researchers have found that once pesticides enter a river, they can be blocked or slowed down by natural processes, allowing them to break down and degrade over time. This is due to the fact that rivers often have natural barriers or slowing-down mechanisms that allow pollutants to be removed or transformed.\n\nThe speaker concludes by saying that they are working on their thesis to address the problems of water pollution and to provide answers to these questions. They also express hope that one day humans will realize that what is bad for the environment is also bad for them, but acknowledge that there is still much work to be done in this area.\n\nSome notable quotes from the transcript include:\n\n* \"C'est pas faux\" (It's not false) - referring to the widespread use of pesticides and their negative impacts.\n* \"Le problème, c'est que les molécules utilisées sont mobiles et peuvent se retrouver en porté par la pluie jusqu'à dans la rivière qui coule un peu plus bas.\" (The problem is that the molecules used are mobile and can move through waterways until they reach a river downstream.)\n* \"Allait l'OIA, la rivière qui était menacée en amont, se voit préserver en aval.\" (As the OIA (water flow) slows down, the river upstream becomes preserved downstream.)","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,356,17771,57375,11,389,665,264,25500,41199,41199,409,220,1399,8261,3625,61257,42587,5512,7010,514,38900,1218,1291,11,5019,326,39982,360,266,12339,11,326,6,1334,1880,326,93847,13,6178,72,45575,41091,7010,1647,96839,294,49963,5014,9024,479,514,98020,61257,6033,1880,272,17771,6316,38920,390,11170,308,19395,1413,13,1708,1105,389,89504,64,96308,409,54021,11,5052,437,8528,60224,6033,5052,437,15430,25297,8467,13,74656,97507,11,3846,1744,503,34155,9395,582,978,11124,11,4502,4864,9189,834,1744,4864,91507,272,351,22847,26317,98385,51681,1157,11,1744,4864,91507,3625,293,2177,261,7010,514,6225,409,1208,82711,1880,28130,51913,2058,40744,3625,5906,31539,1744,841,326,98279,7044,325,3869,67628,5019,45575,20028,13,2998,5891,29097,11,4502,4864,9189,834,2852,11,8492,70,10216,11,8492,27114,11,39015,11,514,18027,978,8065,5622,1973,11,514,1973,11,272,17771,2307,31914,580,11,84568,15132,40744,4684,4558,79507,35881,15433,5512,13,19421,5019,61512,11,272,17771,14707,653,47838,44397,19395,648,1043,18375,978,3625,1615,316,18543,1759,2536,2902,372,1771,5019,31127,12329,3625,17634,3808,409,12155,27833,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,3625,22337,20243,2482,42587,14014,15132,6505,82,1880,3930,27114,466,97958,1880,82133,68226,513,38831,15170,665,2700,978,1370,1208,121696,648,55398,6,2933,7010,1208,44229,20712,7930,4020,273,653,28800,5636,3122,13,8560,75876,43765,11,272,17771,3869,326,31769,47816,11,15132,25945,71151,4667,5512,11,653,409,13026,4881,4046,668,4942,13,19421,4502,9189,3665,89,11,27750,4046,668,4942,7930,282,77065,1922,355,5512,11,3900,379,264,951,2960,33903,294,6,1036,14014,1370,951,46415,409,14896,1880,55847,5512,5019,2558,556,3930,3273,49363,7363,978,13,7695,47090,14707,1744,39043,436,547,13,362,9832,77492,88253,35597,11,27750,4046,668,4942,513,4958,306,3869,2558,556,3930,3273,49363,52087,978,3869,1208,1615,20372,367,2854,8511,13,41621,23933,10333,39723,4864,326,6,3239,48099,11,514,3273,49363,11,9189,514,60534,89,11,1880,2536,13,4275,9189,304,47391,978,668,89,6502,3625,32466,15132,653,4632,13,13789,11,4864,308,34155,6502,6233,648,409,9189,1208,74333,934,3328,42067,33632,519,9952,6316,11376,4502,951,16872,75460,13,1252,28800,294,6,19680,648,11,4864,757,4635,2852,11,503,34155,76190,978,11,45575,4160,321,6496,11,76076,52571,1759,14848,44767,84228,64591,934,31109,37291,3869,326,57286,519,11,3625,61257,15132,14545,447,5512,13,2052,1339,326,88766,5987,11,1208,44229,20712,7930,43989,3026,582,8047,665,1097,546,11,513,4160,275,27389,4120,665,41635,13,34447,4068,653,19227,45125,1826,57375,5636,2558,556,949,19421,14707,16968,71357,11,66021,1744,326,52152,4550,409,1208,44229,20712,11,326,57286,519,4507,275,653,436,69261,50753,409,326,6,20243,283,1001,13,24703,7930,264,5019,1615,978,4474,409,5945,4150,10367,3625,61257,409,13026,4881,1920,355,11,46152,56311,274,31769,4763,1992,1880,513,43678,11,1880,513,7591,911,1013,1880,27584,13,34447,45575,11,74940,1826,514,1920,355,7546,1604,949,9589,54312,1744,3625,61257,15132,5708,5512,7010,514,84850,25121,11,55398,81991,3846,934,31109,45371,48454,11,10071,3900,841,47090,9517,66,5615,466,2192,6316,490,1386,68,3869,17536,11,294,81991,1208,38317,409,2807,265,11,1880,3625,1323,7211,265,665,25288,308,6,22290,2922,6496,949,34447,42676,3900,264,326,6,75876,409,1208,60128,409,42067,89137,11,1880,274,35329,379,264,951,6117,811,11,39723,1826,54312,1744,272,17771,1647,4046,3395,375,961,949,356,17771,326,6,49575,409,27750,4860,7930,757,12460,546,409,326,77025,40807,11,1880,8065,43014,4864,91507,259,1992,294,6,1138,49530,37194,68,10878,519,7643,270,4558,325,11,1469,403,519,27750,34872,1759,951,9517,23475,10253,52088,978,8637,8467,409,1208,25793,409,326,93847,13,19421,44829,7930,829,275,11,653,9880,11,326,6,87713,274,41901,11412,25692,23761,42463,1744,3846,7930,1826,60014,100063,5019,326,41901,2842,40280,1826,44767,60014,100063,5019,25400,13,34447,4864,14425,285,1744,7010,514,96839,11,17317,57038,35597,653,28800,409,3678,265,13,356,17771,6502,51527,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,36815,315,264,10652,922,61257,323,872,5536,389,279,4676,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,5605,430,814,19029,1005,279,4751,330,30223,76195,1,323,4619,10932,311,1650,1124,330,12989,998,47038,45906,3956,1,477,330,351,299,12,32056,82,3343,2435,10552,430,1521,3956,527,1511,42817,2212,279,1917,11,719,872,6372,649,387,33318,13,578,19114,13551,264,3446,922,1701,264,2027,2663,330,50357,8065,27933,76
