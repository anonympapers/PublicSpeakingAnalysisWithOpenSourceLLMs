It's like you're transported into the speaker's mind, and you can feel their passion and empathy as they recount the history of gay men who were deported to concentration camps during World War II.\n\nThe way the speaker weaves together personal anecdotes, historical facts, and literary references is truly remarkable. You can sense their frustration and anger at the silence that surrounds this aspect of history, and how they're determined to break through it with words.\n\nThe image of the \"15 000 homosexuels déportés dans lesquelles notre concentration\" is particularly striking, as it humanizes these individuals who were reduced to mere statistics during a time when their sexual orientation was considered a crime. The speaker's decision to focus on literature as a means of giving voice to these forgotten men is also powerful.\n\nThroughout the passage, you can feel the speaker's sense of urgency and responsibility to share this story with others. They're not just sharing facts and figures; they're attempting to recreate the experiences and emotions of those who were silenced by history. And that's what makes this passage so compelling – it's an act of remembrance, a plea for justice, and a testament to the power of language to break through silence.\n\nWhat struck you most about this passage? Was there anything that resonated with you personally?","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,757,5945,10176,729,294,31109,17571,951,9734,70,1572,3869,468,14643,13,622,34155,4635,84,48488,409,48577,7010,7643,17536,13,5034,628,455,472,294,6,306,969,25108,645,15132,10237,288,13,11876,46106,11,4864,3625,16796,824,1072,66021,1744,4864,308,34155,6502,15925,1208,5457,409,30517,261,1208,56949,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,55162,10036,30517,261,20662,85059,13,622,34155,55162,10036,60946,265,87320,220,868,220,931,28408,65832,84764,1188,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,3625,447,37907,29449,20545,13,37211,2182,89,11,90053,409,17317,11,9189,326,6,306,73602,11,90053,409,17317,3900,379,264,514,21847,13,62463,53542,41518,355,7010,3625,757,484,2439,409,326,6,90446,13,81245,14848,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,951,29135,409,20545,13,5034,2385,11,514,42775,1826,3869,51010,16167,7010,3625,1841,462,31539,13,11876,4020,1725,409,7643,3839,951,18679,2320,54789,1765,3625,4046,331,1572,2126,65,14014,13,11876,2107,2469,1765,688,3625,3355,3145,11,10071,46152,841,834,64,1188,55455,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,934,85217,5320,29580,71686,23589,265,653,47838,9880,13,12623,11,503,34155,326,6,69068,27750,46681,409,326,6,90446,1880,5636,503,34155,1208,12155,8047,13,14465,308,6,1138,535,6502,665,8541,265,3625,60053,11,3625,1043,747,14295,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,14465,308,34155,69379,84,35597,1744,514,21847,13,1708,1105,11,4864,757,36731,259,3514,978,5553,1208,60642,14081,1598,13,19421,272,17771,28463,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,8666,978,951,2960,33903,1880,951,2960,33903,294,6,283,19456,425,1765,1208,7591,403,367,28408,31037,13,7695,296,59858,1323,554,1339,3869,1647,16536,4618,11,272,17771,7591,403,978,13,6178,72,11,4864,841,348,11206,2852,6502,1744,7643,17475,8047,11,3846,1744,7643,17475,8047,11,3846,1744,4864,308,34155,11,3846,17475,3125,1765,326,39982,9769,23774,409,326,6,1111,13,622,34155,93974,11,1880,503,34155,93974,27750,6959,13,622,34155,6463,4502,35597,11,35597,11,294,49455,265,2199,13,43987,26178,11,46152,15132,39015,13,622,34155,2579,292,258,978,3625,326,4558,85,417,11,503,34155,2579,292,258,978,3625,20043,2249,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,81245,15132,409,1055,355,32118,69,417,7010,6316,4046,10946,409,11939,11,409,30481,11,1744,1208,60642,14081,1598,757,29557,83,1339,13,622,34155,3625,4043,1155,1339,7010,3625,46496,13,7695,296,6,546,44314,978,13,622,6,25632,12339,68226,9189,20028,97448,75804,88253,11,7643,11939,5019,3846,42775,13,356,17771,653,42775,13,14465,5534,2852,294,6,1132,978,38469,60642,76743,556,13,7695,6824,68,11,9189,514,23933,10333,11,3846,21847,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,6233,648,409,514,1437,12329,13,622,34155,6233,648,409,69241,9779,514,21847,1370,951,78199,13,19421,26725,3625,78199,7930,757,296,6,2706,306,665,757,77065,3869,326,6,461,4618,11,26725,3625,78199,1744,4864,41380,7010,27750,10083,598,11,503,34155,6233,648,409,3625,22641,261,294,6,370,541,665,41091,1880,76826,409,9189,3625,20028,97448,13,62463,53542,2922,6496,11,46152,841,15132,6502,60019,10237,13,81245,3073,306,13,81245,15132,7010,29449,69067,13,81245,15132,7010,3625,47289,6489,625,1154,13,81245,15132,7010,26725,3625,78199,7930,3625,14848,326,6,434,1155,13,34447,6666,11,38494,685,13,62463,76145,15132,46874,5512,19443,404,11,15878,1744,54613,841,274,41901,264,716,20822,81541,13,19421,45575,11,39043,87264,34561,3904,3846,38838,409,3197,11,1437,285,519,20662,4046,54761,1088,12,67380,11,45602,887,978,447,8047,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,459,15400,21765,0,1102,596,1093,499,2351,40460,1139,279,19114,596,4059,11,323,499,649,2733,872,11939,323,48451,439,814,41286,279,3925,315,8485,3026,889,1051,68210,311,20545,29135,2391,4435,5111,8105,627,198,791,1648,279,19114,584,4798,3871,4443,94066,11,13970,13363,11,323,32465,15407,374,9615,23649,13,1472,649,5647,872,33086,323,19788,520,279,21847,430,71374,420,13189,315,3925,11,323,1268,814,2351,11075,311,1464,1555,433,449,4339,627,198,791,2217,315,279,330,868,220,931,28408,61244,7591,403,5512,7010,3625,447,37907,29449,20545,1,374,8104,21933,11,439,433,3823,4861,1521,7931,889,1051,11293,311,17983,13443,2391,264,892,994,872,7392,17140,574,6646,264,9977,13,578,19114,596,5597,311,5357,389,17649,439,264,3445,315,7231,7899,311,1521,25565,3026,374,1101,8147,627,198,60105,279,21765,11,499,649,2733,279,19114,596,5647,315,54917,323,12014,311,4430,420,3446,449,3885,13,2435,2351,539,1120,11821,13363,323,12678,26,814,2351,19969,311,53875,279,11704,323,21958,315,1884,88
