{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T23:06:18.901249926Z","response":"**DIMENSION:** [In my opinion, the speech is very persuasive and effectively crafts a convincing message. The historian's reasoning is rigorous and well-structured, making it easy to follow her argumentation.]\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\n\nThe speaker begins by introducing herself as an historian who travels through time, which sets the tone for her narrative style. She then takes the audience on a journey back in time to 1946, when life was precarious and healthcare was limited.\n\nShe highlights the difficulties faced by women giving birth and the lack of medical care available at that time. By contrast, she notes the significant improvements made since then, thanks to the efforts of healthcare professionals.\n\nThe speaker's use of storytelling is a strength, as she shares the experiences of midwives who worked in challenging conditions, often with limited resources. Her emphasis on the importance of recording these stories and preserving collective memory is also compelling.\n\nThroughout the speech, the speaker's passion for her subject matter shines through, making it engaging and relatable to the audience. Her ability to weave together historical facts, personal anecdotes, and emotional appeals creates a powerful narrative that draws the listener in.\n\n**RATING:** 9/10\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give this speech a perfect score is that some parts of the delivery felt a bit slow or repetitive. Additionally, some listeners might find the historical context a bit too dense or overwhelming. However, overall, the speaker's persuasive power and ability to craft a compelling narrative make her speech very effective.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,3900,379,264,66056,7930,27389,4338,306,1208,36252,89577,6033,35597,66056,7930,27389,4338,306,1208,96586,22299,20662,84850,4558,21152,13088,373,99492,13,6178,72,11,4864,841,27389,3826,3675,11,10071,4864,66517,79071,14896,409,64972,13,22425,26584,11,4864,757,45640,2852,7010,514,27138,13,12095,4864,9189,834,272,96287,8065,1156,677,409,9160,569,11,3846,39904,8811,70,483,11,281,10610,292,27658,6033,35597,3197,409,281,14081,258,4306,13109,11,9189,87040,9189,13510,10071,934,17771,54312,934,80720,17317,15473,46452,13,34447,389,687,22550,11,4864,9189,44314,2852,951,59400,552,409,1647,72,2442,414,483,11,409,924,33920,2427,2177,24201,11,39043,9189,1370,273,25692,85815,653,28800,5636,13,56744,72,9189,11,11083,85321,513,57992,11,25692,85815,1744,3738,288,14848,46939,33537,978,4415,24918,13,19421,1370,8318,9189,11,9622,46138,11,14707,11,9189,47592,1862,978,13,23097,375,41881,45325,7010,20662,71632,294,6,582,3102,1133,11,951,12933,11,951,32118,8332,1354,11,951,274,1154,33651,2249,7364,409,9189,11,16968,1826,17508,6593,69068,11,6155,9769,69328,1880,3625,90551,65,5512,52579,665,2349,100198,665,4865,409,80259,13,34447,1765,12036,5048,6354,675,942,834,519,665,802,65220,11,48021,8065,38900,1880,96586,8065,38900,308,31769,85806,6502,13826,83972,51794,13,48109,74533,665,220,777,2790,11,1208,51223,16588,1826,653,76235,1133,55467,11,10071,3625,4787,409,17536,15132,27389,936,3946,1880,1208,6671,8528,60224,1826,27389,24719,5048,13,1252,90551,92174,1765,4848,11,308,6,57558,6502,326,6,9011,713,294,22827,459,13,220,1227,127036,272,17771,514,8941,818,1880,15878,829,97839,11,1880,348,265,2249,1824,2910,273,13026,409,274,1154,33651,2249,5019,326,6,49575,409,326,6,25108,273,13,33150,934,31109,7591,566,2910,13109,11,8065,19910,951,4046,74199,15760,1392,8952,4918,11,951,8811,17491,665,4156,275,409,934,35329,47090,88661,1143,4046,70312,16339,1880,653,893,593,3062,409,85505,409,77323,13,34447,436,395,554,89,28800,3869,28800,951,1097,73511,269,811,13,34447,665,220,777,2491,11,220,2790,11,777,1490,11,934,17771,54312,7930,264,2609,978,949,2895,66096,3869,7930,4068,949,19421,14707,5019,75871,265,3869,27750,4860,11,259,2053,23008,514,470,325,951,27138,77580,11,4864,296,6,2734,336,285,7010,934,80720,13,14465,91507,3869,1208,10607,409,779,625,15844,54401,409,91727,7010,26077,84921,1880,409,26077,85722,11,3846,15132,1097,73511,269,5512,15907,69792,90053,409,1208,29394,325,11,4415,24918,1880,46110,665,9822,13,14465,16006,2852,44767,294,6,16288,1208,85722,15890,11,8065,45369,409,326,6,90446,11,14848,4046,12821,96559,3625,12823,1880,3625,55744,8467,2145,519,3869,2773,283,35573,1208,77323,409,1208,296,12339,1880,409,326,41901,61827,11,3869,1097,73511,15171,3625,14726,8952,59307,1880,3625,4787,3869,1208,4415,24918,13,7695,3429,77422,1744,22463,841,274,17771,6502,20272,665,653,9880,13,19421,14707,20662,7645,35456,16968,4538,6225,13,2998,67781,11,514,72601,409,77323,1744,17317,4635,2852,38448,26725,75804,88253,3869,1208,58384,11,3869,9686,12,1399,57485,3869,3846,68866,978,1880,3869,829,296,10610,414,483,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4046,68019,326,6,90446,409,1208,77323,841,25692,513,20028,15878,4046,68019,326,6,90446,951,1343,40055,1910,1769,13,7695,274,6,74972,409,48021,3869,1208,2700,8047,409,26725,951,9517,66,1220,409,17536,7930,841,15132,7010,85624,2246,294,6,96912,11,85624,56984,13,19421,87320,6502,20028,665,80444,1744,514,10960,282,13559,48901,409,29449,32118,97495,22498,949,62408,85722,951,34280,811,294,6,90446,665,1208,21901,685,1765,951,47289,6489,625,1154,71925,6960,14707,951,33670,1154,13,62463,1343,40055,1910,15844,14848,17951,7010,28130,1841,65220,11,389,513,1323,17060,269,519,28130,7591,1010,11,28130,60020,13,19421,14707,11,27549,21559,3869,46131,1208,9517,49235,1516,951,2609,3808,13,62463,1343,300,296,6,306,5612,6316,87810,51199,68,13,4072,645,14848,16968,1469,403,978,79071,14896,409,51199,68,11,10071,4502,4864,9189,834,934,6,37907,14848,653,3197,665,34561,11,84568,14848,20662,98733,978,409,1380,4150,10367,779,625,8047,1880,71751,1208,17536,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,76219,24557,68063,510,644,856,9647,11,279,8982,374,1633,66343,323,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,13,578,44068,596,33811,374,47999,323,1664,12,52243,11,3339,433,4228,311,1833,1077,5811,367,25750,198,198,334,49873,25823,68063,198,198,791,19114,12302,555,33018,11937,439,459,44068,889,35292,1555,892,11,902,743
