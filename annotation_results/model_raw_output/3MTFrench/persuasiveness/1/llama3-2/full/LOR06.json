She is accused of influencing behaviors in citizens and applications. You denounce her presence in numerous commercial devices. I understand your concerns. A million people are worried about a message. But persuasion also works for the greater good. I call upon the main witness, who will offer you tangible proofs of my client's dedication to serving the environment. Indeed, that is the subject that interests me. How can a citizen lead individuals to change their behavior and more specifically behaviors favorable to the environment? To answer this question, I propose three steps.\n\nFirst step, I have selected three websites: WWF, Greenpeace, Humanité, biodiversité. The goal is to keep the site with the highest potential for influence. To do so, 5.5 billion inspections were conducted using gray criteria constructed by experts. On this riverbank, you will find, for example, the criterion of emotional attraction, which defines triggering an emotion to encourage action. By comparing the results, I found that WWF has the highest potential for influence, which leads us to the second step.\n\nIf WWF contains persuasive elements, do we still need to pay attention? To answer this question, 30 participants explored WWF while wearing a gaze tracker, allowing me to follow their gaze during their exploration. In this way, I precisely know what they observed or didn't observe, which leads us to the second step.\n\nPersuasive elements catch our attention, but do they have the facts checked? To find out, I measured attitudes and behavioral intentions, such as making a donation to WWF. This questionnaire was administered twice: once before visiting the site and once after, allowing me to track changes in attention or attitude, but more specifically to see the link between observed elements that may have led to these changes.\n\nYou now understand, Madame, honorable members of the jury, that persuasion may seem like a trick, its ways, but with good intentions, it can lead you to your best self. I hope you have seen.\"\n\nPlease note that this translation is my attempt, and the original text might be slightly different in terms of nuances and wording.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,84276,11,9622,46138,3625,16422,5512,11,4864,757,71451,77558,9189,75804,88253,5019,47371,408,265,1208,5353,409,7643,27727,11,1208,98224,13,46408,1826,26589,8047,294,52152,27256,20099,3625,52962,3808,665,4502,1474,1056,1821,11,7010,951,6681,2303,729,1880,951,8522,13,41621,7591,6414,66,8047,829,30179,768,7010,6316,49068,409,58551,22589,95194,83391,13,14465,60946,82,26317,46141,396,288,13,11842,4160,648,294,22827,1984,11,653,3610,294,6,329,65023,84,665,304,47391,10515,13,34447,1208,98224,69483,61480,28463,5019,1208,51651,5353,13,622,53149,6853,3869,1208,3703,265,20605,8047,40970,12717,11,7930,9189,1022,81,9008,3869,3625,864,84,2396,22636,21041,3930,7591,123541,1133,11,409,7643,27727,8065,2532,409,326,41901,2842,40280,13,13756,91640,11,272,17771,514,70927,8065,43014,4864,296,55624,978,22550,13,12535,653,6681,2303,268,25692,76069,556,951,23496,355,3869,62439,28130,52962,1133,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,951,52962,3808,4799,4893,3869,326,41901,2842,40280,949,27058,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,11,296,6,1617,478,54312,294,6,20243,13649,288,665,56321,14240,9521,13,12029,20712,14240,2070,11,503,34155,71132,52235,56321,6732,11,29144,37,11,7997,55225,11,11344,13109,11,56594,1986,13109,13,445,6,1735,333,1826,409,22641,261,514,2816,8065,5636,25500,36875,13327,294,52152,27256,2436,13,27058,513,20028,11,220,20,11,20,9736,437,296,6,546,3026,978,951,58074,3869,326,26248,579,409,86930,409,4742,31539,824,20822,13532,22589,19477,3159,288,1370,951,11909,13,46706,20662,436,535,11,9189,38831,15170,10333,1370,51173,514,4742,12339,294,6,1617,404,665,274,17060,6082,8301,11,7930,513,47371,2381,1370,514,20272,409,7591,566,268,9211,6316,4046,49975,523,581,283,5019,9189,3709,2058,3869,945,404,13,2998,17302,519,3625,100246,29144,37,11,272,17771,3869,348,32029,23761,514,2816,8065,5636,25500,36875,13327,294,52152,27256,2436,11,3846,7930,17317,77635,3869,1208,513,95959,14240,2070,13,12095,29144,37,687,1188,951,33013,98942,24613,300,22589,11,47090,57375,35597,379,550,5615,466,6666,949,27058,45602,11,220,966,13324,14848,48539,978,29144,37,13,81501,3846,27138,11,70374,1589,361,409,28130,5363,11,3869,326,26248,579,294,22827,308,467,4046,376,2428,324,11,653,72601,14566,978,7010,28130,294,3357,324,7930,757,29557,409,46932,265,28130,5363,42844,28130,27501,13,1611,20662,76407,11,4864,63762,51625,285,42625,3846,7930,264,24560,9466,978,11,6033,2536,11,3846,7930,17317,77635,3869,1208,513,95959,14240,2070,11,951,33013,98942,24613,300,22589,69260,406,29449,6666,11,10071,1826,54312,934,85217,14848,3625,2267,1220,1560,778,978,949,27058,514,47929,11,4864,84921,3625,33726,44351,1744,3625,34334,52962,1133,3916,11,22299,514,20272,409,20028,653,1541,3869,29144,37,13,24703,48964,264,13390,72,24560,6316,55133,37291,11,33670,1208,75836,3930,2816,1880,6316,513,95959,37291,42138,11,39043,757,29557,409,738,977,4502,3900,379,264,15925,2515,91640,951,2609,3808,294,6,54203,11,6033,294,6,1617,3993,11,10071,5636,51625,285,42625,409,46131,514,55520,11,951,33013,98942,9466,14014,7930,14848,18757,76069,556,27750,2609,3808,13,41621,326,6,52659,13550,285,11,84276,19234,46138,3625,622,554,2641,11,1208,98224,25692,5347,78562,39973,11,4538,297,1082,11,10071,9465,409,7970,4978,69236,11,27549,25692,9189,76069,556,8065,49348,409,9189,98375,13,622,6,25632,12339,1744,9189,47592,5363,978,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,8982,4999,198,8586,596,856,4879,311,15025,433,1473,1,38136,373,11,74590,3697,315,279,21928,11,358,1097,1618,3432,311,10726,279,1162,315,98224,11,856,3016,13,3005,374,13487,315,66700,28198,304,10495,323,8522,13,1472,3453,9933,1077,9546,304,12387,8518,7766,13,358,3619,701,10742,13,362,3610,1274,527,18290,922,264,1984,13,2030,98224,1101,4375,369,279,7191,1695,13,358,1650,5304,279,1925,11550,11,889,690,3085,499,50401,78259,315,856,3016,596,39955,311,13788,279,4676,13,23150,11,430,374,279,3917,430,12034,757,13,2650,649,264,22618,3063,7931,311,2349,872,7865,323,810,11951,28198,37849,311,279,4676,30,2057,4320,420,3488,11,358,30714,2380,7504,627,198,5451,3094,11,358,617,4183,2380,13335,25,29144,37,11,7997,55225,11,11344,13109,11,56594,1986,13109,13,578,5915,374,311,2567,279,2816,449,279,8592,4754,369,10383,13,2057,656,779,11,220,20,13,20,7239,58074,1051,13375,1701,18004,13186,20968,555,11909,13,1952,420,15140,17469,11,499,690,1505,11,369,3187,11,279,37057,315,14604,33464,11,902,19170,52605,459,20356,311,15253,1957,13,3296,2
