Your audience was thoroughly engaged throughout your talk.\n\nFirstly, you skillfully introduced the concept of clore des connes, an insecticide that has been banned for over 20 years due to its persistent environmental and health hazards. You highlighted how this substance can contaminate soil, plants, and animals, including pigs, which are a significant source of food for humans.\n\nNext, you expertly linked your story about the three little pigs to the real-life scenario of pig farming. You explained that the first two pigs, living in the open air or attached to a mango tree, are at risk of ingesting contaminated soil and plants. In contrast, the third pig, living in a building without direct access to the outside world, is less likely to be exposed to this toxic substance.\n\nYour presentation also touched on the importance of food safety and human health. You emphasized that if clore des connes enters the pork supply chain, it can contaminate meat and pose risks to consumers. This prompted you to share your research goals: understanding how this substance is distributed within the pig's body and eliminated over time.\n\nBy developing a mathematical model for predicting concentrations of clore des connes in the pig's body, you aim to provide insights that will help farmers and policymakers make informed decisions about reducing exposure to this harmful substance. Your work has the potential to inform recommendations on best practices for pig farming and food safety.\n\nIn conclusion, your engaging narrative style, paired with your scientific expertise, effectively conveyed the importance of addressing pesticide contamination in pig farming. You left a lasting impression on your audience, making them appreciate the often-overlooked but crucial role that pigs play in our food system.
