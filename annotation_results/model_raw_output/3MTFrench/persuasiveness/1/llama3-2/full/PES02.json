{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T22:49:30.38606886Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as follows:\n\n**Credibility:** 8/10\nThe speaker establishes themselves as an expert in the field by mentioning their experience and research on the topic of cycling. They also provide specific examples and data to support their claims.\n\n**Logic:** 9/10\nThe speaker presents a clear and coherent argument, using logical reasoning to connect their ideas. They provide a historical context for the evolution of cycling and its relationship with social class, which helps to build a compelling narrative.\n\n**Emotional Appeal:** 7/10\nWhile the speaker does not use overt emotional appeals or storytelling techniques, they do establish a sense of familiarity and shared experience with their audience by using personal anecdotes and rhetorical questions. This creates a sense of connection and shared understanding.\n\n**Rigor of Reasoning:** 9/10\nThe speaker's reasoning is rigorous and well-supported by data and examples. They provide specific statistics and historical context to support their claims, which adds credibility to their argument.\n\n**Overall Persuasiveness:** 8.5/10\nWhile the speaker does not use particularly persuasive language or emotional appeals, they do establish themselves as an expert in the field and present a well-reasoned and coherent argument. The audience is likely to be convinced by the speaker's expertise and logical reasoning, even if the speech does not explicitly try to persuade them.\n\nPlease note that this assessment is subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives and cultural backgrounds.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,423,6,2933,9189,47592,1744,4864,36731,653,28800,7591,3209,361,13,3489,438,4864,757,36731,1672,38096,3869,3846,934,54386,2126,713,11,503,31769,2629,285,20272,3869,326,27688,8047,1744,503,65948,2852,96586,1765,20662,1156,48099,9952,1647,45165,385,13,19421,8811,75876,43765,11,3900,1826,89532,1206,12267,479,7010,514,83229,70,1001,85624,2680,42827,841,35737,27865,69068,13,4418,66,1913,54960,11,25400,2442,85815,1370,3625,2486,812,45165,385,11,4864,757,30714,409,89504,409,15265,10648,3930,45165,385,13,7695,379,264,3738,1133,1370,8318,9189,951,48577,7930,42587,306,514,45165,385,27467,12558,2734,1133,13,423,81979,665,37622,934,41901,37622,934,41901,37622,3900,20272,72006,11,1880,35597,294,81979,7930,841,274,59858,92759,306,6502,3930,16968,13,7695,379,264,44093,15925,951,48577,7930,42587,306,514,45165,385,5636,1744,294,81979,13,34447,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,272,17771,409,60946,265,4068,3625,4046,12821,4065,409,27750,304,978,16876,35933,409,95234,13,4241,9425,326,52152,7611,3930,45165,385,11,3625,91678,811,1744,29449,77824,513,20272,409,3846,3941,14848,2848,2159,42625,4046,12821,96559,13,65381,1208,1913,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,11,514,45165,385,1826,514,91116,409,30296,951,53416,13,1611,326,49455,265,409,1709,67100,10253,65838,220,777,1399,11,3846,3941,3567,1188,514,45165,83613,1130,8045,61175,409,326,6,17060,1149,49686,951,6989,32849,17724,13,65381,1208,16578,409,27750,26633,6954,59307,305,1154,11,514,45165,385,9465,7010,653,8348,13532,25253,29005,713,11,326,6,9011,713,91329,1640,2428,13,2895,66096,3869,653,5790,3078,325,479,951,97035,11,514,45165,385,513,5276,68,8065,31260,3869,1208,37291,45064,2428,1880,4046,56745,2933,29557,61512,409,75871,265,10253,5934,263,5247,1744,17317,1153,306,29449,4046,5481,593,13,80905,830,30148,11,4502,1208,9781,585,42827,7829,66601,3930,45165,385,312,755,258,15760,15878,272,24201,29449,39474,3869,326,6,67816,11,3625,528,14081,5615,2641,15132,409,46131,4068,513,1208,513,4790,3159,7010,12155,55744,8467,13,19421,14707,1744,514,51913,3294,951,97035,17634,409,43453,514,45165,385,19411,11,3625,3369,1441,3930,54606,409,1208,95234,4244,13,65381,326,31769,331,6853,409,326,6,351,6200,316,53301,11,389,738,349,1744,27750,36852,59307,65838,514,54606,409,1208,95234,513,20272,294,6,370,541,7010,3625,36282,26886,645,13,2998,92759,519,11,8065,33537,978,951,65838,220,2031,11,409,326,6,25108,273,409,9822,11,4864,738,349,1744,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,11,1208,95234,1826,10449,8047,294,22827,1486,409,48234,52482,13,33150,84228,593,1744,11,3869,12366,11,1208,95234,1826,934,300,3904,304,29675,5048,11,45575,934,80720,513,5088,1188,665,9120,11828,361,13,19421,8065,45369,951,35881,15433,22589,1567,288,11,8065,84228,593,653,5790,3078,325,479,29079,23053,409,326,6,18168,9465,3625,7317,6491,3946,13,19421,8065,1620,665,220,508,605,11,8065,84228,593,1744,1208,95234,513,9120,35965,8047,3869,12366,11,45575,1744,4538,10648,274,17771,9517,47348,665,84411,764,28154,13,80905,830,30148,11,20662,9517,58904,409,326,6,18168,308,17771,6502,71686,29079,11,10071,28463,3674,11,514,81131,294,39982,1291,4319,69733,665,9120,11828,361,11,308,17771,6502,514,27584,1744,514,81131,409,9880,3930,4319,69733,3869,12366,13,19421,665,5636,409,20662,49586,11,4864,757,36731,92759,978,3869,951,84939,2852,908,729,11,31807,1748,7010,951,1081,8699,409,9120,11828,1157,5019,3625,91026,1880,60946,265,514,10648,1880,28130,91678,367,3930,45165,385,13,43987,26178,1744,4864,5891,80463,1647,69003,8047,16968,3869,326,6,75876,11,25692,85815,463,331,1430,7010,6316,951,8415,94829,8467,11,1744,4864,9189,16796,10045,978,11,32343,17194,11,38682,360,1291,11,99568,3675,1880,2536,32343,17194,13,80905,830,30148,11,8065,33614,409,20662,57485,367,1880,409,20662,9517,58904,409,326,6,18168,11,389,25692,60946,265,1744,4502,20662,57485,367,50590,24560,908,978,220,1272,8261,1370,1860,685,11,9189,45366,23761,38831,66867,8047,7010,6316,47838,8415,97193,13,1252,4502,7643,270,4558,325,61158,6853,1744,1131,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,11263,1473,9,78204,1171,3225,68063,220,23,14,605,198,791,19114,64664,5694,439,459,6335,304,279,2115,555,45391,872,3217,323,3495,389,279,8712,315,33162,13,2435,1101,3493,3230,10507,323,828,311,1862,872,8349,382,9,9,27849,68063,220,24,14,605,198,791,19114,18911,264,2867,323,56887,5811,11,1701,20406,33811,311,4667,872,
