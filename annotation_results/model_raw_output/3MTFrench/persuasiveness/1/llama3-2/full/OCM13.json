It seems like you're discussing the importance of tourism in Occitanie (a region in southern France) and how it can be leveraged to drive economic growth and job creation.\n\nYou highlighted some impressive statistics, such as the fact that one person out of seven worldwide has traveled around the globe, making Occitanie the 4th region in France for international tourist arrivals. You also emphasized the potential of Indian tourists, who are increasingly interested in traveling abroad.\n\nYour suggestions for welcoming these new tourists included providing them with cultural references and experiences that align with their expectations and interests. You also touched on the idea of creating a new brand or label to promote Occitanie as a destination, which could help attract more international visitors.\n\nI must say, your passion and enthusiasm are contagious! It's clear that you're deeply invested in this project and want to see it succeed. I hope that your message will resonate with others and inspire them to take action.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to help you with or any further insights you'd like me to provide on this topic.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,507,12825,3625,84064,417,3930,14986,44618,13,921,20234,76132,11,3900,5208,13,19421,272,17771,25945,14707,13,3263,42441,89,665,220,679,22,13,39783,54613,1765,220,22,7010,514,38900,264,23933,351,978,90053,409,1208,3197,66522,13,64105,64,50590,348,2784,1744,326,88766,87,13145,648,1826,1208,220,19,68,88100,409,9822,5019,1208,7432,40,951,14986,75460,4046,376,14381,13,19421,49733,11,514,14986,44618,11,272,17771,653,991,5481,648,1765,220,605,13,64105,64,50590,348,2784,1744,326,22827,85877,408,9484,409,46131,39043,513,514,37417,52138,26193,93381,396,409,84364,409,220,3101,11990,294,6,485,65023,355,13,41621,9189,66651,42463,220,3101,11990,11,272,17771,272,6009,37291,1208,7187,93424,13,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,36731,5804,467,20811,1744,326,88766,87,13145,648,264,26725,3625,3869,16968,5019,15907,294,1439,20662,48659,3016,51453,13,1708,1105,13085,89,13,12535,958,1018,461,22299,514,308,9769,10367,25692,20028,5019,15907,294,1439,30,356,17771,43453,14986,17194,13,41621,11,42676,9189,45165,15292,89,45325,47592,951,2109,31539,30,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,73953,1744,3625,14986,75460,1280,1188,28463,11,389,63669,409,2109,31539,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,951,10105,13,89454,1082,6033,3846,10219,265,1765,26725,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,294,69537,361,484,404,11,312,2002,404,1880,20028,19443,404,27750,87325,14986,75460,13,3489,6853,1920,355,48021,665,2035,30,3489,37907,22639,11,934,2053,12823,30,19421,87320,6502,6316,48659,75467,30,41621,326,6,52659,13550,285,30,89454,1082,1826,463,2203,19395,1413,13,29124,45317,648,11,59471,11,75467,12,354,85005,11,15983,38469,11,20662,38317,3613,68495,16968,514,38900,66021,934,80720,11,66021,1744,16968,514,38900,1826,11866,76366,7010,3846,46494,13,1611,84364,6033,409,78060,11,20662,38317,1826,3062,13,1708,1105,11,4864,73953,1744,12155,14986,75460,1280,80463,11,389,63669,11,934,54386,513,24671,409,1131,2009,293,858,333,409,1647,42775,1826,409,282,15433,52424,3625,7970,4978,98733,5512,13,46706,326,39982,9769,23774,11151,321,11,1208,98052,2060,11,3625,6732,31070,8467,11,1880,27584,9189,11,4502,9964,439,379,653,11,7010,26317,6299,13,1708,1105,11,272,17771,83195,11,3900,379,264,12366,11,272,17771,7970,13,7695,379,264,514,1647,10167,91340,356,24540,11,3900,379,264,326,39982,9769,23774,409,9822,11,10071,274,1815,89,1744,84440,11,46152,15132,665,5542,409,4143,1133,665,22199,261,514,84751,1280,3675,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,25632,12339,11,503,6,25632,12339,11,10071,294,58591,978,1869,53819,11,1744,9189,5945,10176,408,23577,409,3846,4545,13,622,6,25632,12339,1744,3846,4545,35737,514,1131,1252,4545,3062,11,7970,9189,13,19421,503,6,25632,12339,1744,87158,9189,91026,978,951,31070,288,1826,103763,5512,7010,29449,7317,6491,556,11,9189,9189,958,299,1414,89,11,9189,11,1765,3846,1744,9189,45366,20028,11,5019,64972,3625,1046,361,484,404,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,15864,0,1102,5084,1093,499,2351,25394,279,12939,315,32083,304,20522,13145,648,320,64,5654,304,18561,9822,8,323,1268,433,649,387,28605,3359,311,6678,7100,6650,323,2683,9886,627,198,2675,27463,1063,16358,13443,11,1778,439,279,2144,430,832,1732,704,315,8254,15603,706,31796,2212,279,24867,11,3339,20522,13145,648,279,220,19,339,5654,304,9822,369,6625,31070,70147,13,1472,1101,46728,279,4754,315,7904,32753,11,889,527,15098,8173,304,21646,22917,627,198,7927,18726,369,36387,1521,502,32753,5343,8405,1124,449,13042,15407,323,11704,430,5398,449,872,17078,323,12034,13,1472,1101,24891,389,279,4623,315,6968,264,502,6883,477,2440,311,12192,20522,13145,648,439,264,9284,11,902,1436,1520,9504,810,6625,15613,627,198,40,2011,2019,11,701,11939,323,36232,527,89534,0,1102,596,2867,430,499,2351,17693,29091,304,420,2447,323,1390,311,1518,433,12265,13,358,3987,430,701,1984,690,89986,449,3885,323,31740,1124,311,1935,1957,627,198,5618,1095,757,1440,422,1070,596,4205,3230,499,4265,1093,757,311,1520,499,449,477,904,4726,26793,499,4265,1093,757,311,3493,389,420,8712,13,128009],"total_duration":52322203055,"load_duration":201090,"prompt_eval_count":592,"prompt_eval_duration":2589706000,"eval_count":227,"eval_duration":49731679000}
