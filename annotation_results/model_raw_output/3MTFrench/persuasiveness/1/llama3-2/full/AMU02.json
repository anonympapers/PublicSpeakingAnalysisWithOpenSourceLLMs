Here's my attempt:\n\nAfter my Bac+8 years ago, I chose to listen to my heart. Thank you, Mom and Dad. I wanted to become a doctor. I had stars in my eyes and rocks full of holes. Even as a kid, I was curious about meteorites in the black sky. Garoboli! I used theory that orbits far from home. But sometimes, fast fragments fall on the ground, uninvited. Common ones, they weigh a lot. But in this oval song, we'll just say \"été\" (summer), horite, Garoboli!\n\nThe problem we face with our friend-foes is not where they fall, but the steroids that inhabit them. To answer your question, we need to resign from space travel, and it might cost a lot, even if it's less expensive, friscal. Garoboli! The asteroids are light, unlike big planets, their hearts haven't liquefied, preserving their history for five billion years, they remained like an agate, the only one showing how the solar system formed. It's time to put my thesis proposal on the table. Let's see if it's affordable with the rhymes I impose.\n\nObserve at night or march in a straight line; let's see what I've chosen to make clear in this noise-art? It's in the vastness of air, far from all alteration, that fragments of the solar system repost with discretion. Without animosity or pain, once I return from my hunt, I take up my inhumane science, mortal and broken. Always in my laboratory, I sieve, I crush, I date without making a single mistake, the fall on earth of its cailloux (rock fragments). The results I found confirm what we suspect: steroids are battered victims of numerous blows.\n\nNow it's time to find the steroid that flogs us with thousands of fragments. In this family relationship resides the origin of the distant star. To find this lineage, one of the methods I develop is studying deep craters on a huge scree, Garoboli!\n\nThe moral of this story, if memory fails you, is that the earth is the mirror of mysteries and what's up there. As for the question that burns you, about the reason for this rancor, I like when it suddenly bursts forth in reactivity, it's the Cartesian maphology, Garoboli!\n\nPlease let me know if this translation meets your expectations or if you'd like me to make any changes!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,5186,12416,1647,80980,3900,379,264,220,23,8261,11,503,34155,2665,13532,294,6,20243,2743,1647,1080,12844,13,25145,72,48488,11,281,18826,1474,13005,13,14465,348,11206,2852,409,43406,656,302,12844,13,622,49152,2852,951,4046,998,3742,7010,3625,20043,2249,1880,951,22710,417,84871,3625,6916,288,2902,277,417,13,50501,44424,16968,342,437,325,11,503,34155,24560,2917,53819,11,951,36252,978,1439,7010,514,12088,301,56662,13,12471,677,14559,0,622,34155,42587,978,23258,2303,67,7930,37466,635,78060,409,46206,17317,13,34447,1370,86633,11,951,35603,7477,3422,11,1448,285,665,1208,88026,44180,306,653,16081,13,423,6,1334,853,7930,824,447,1088,514,2092,11,3625,5636,1081,8699,11,39043,281,4558,325,514,9955,1269,13,34447,7010,20662,523,37645,409,61137,11,17317,5534,2439,70374,296,6,39883,11,4917,635,11,12471,677,14559,0,2009,80259,7930,17317,304,22631,306,46206,12155,1097,8467,19432,511,537,82,1474,8467,11,3846,308,17771,6502,326,6,408,69596,39723,3900,44180,306,11,10071,1208,58161,7930,3625,14464,306,11,4502,5019,75871,265,3869,1208,3488,11,3900,17317,47090,7591,2796,63983,20487,11,39043,10025,593,409,1080,30872,466,7970,7970,11,27584,4502,272,17771,40970,1206,5763,11,1448,16164,13,12471,677,14559,0,11876,264,5455,1759,4295,35511,63828,1414,11,8065,32150,556,951,20547,288,11841,2392,11,28130,1080,12844,841,274,17771,6502,12046,978,10188,978,30179,651,519,28130,87810,11,934,54386,7245,635,272,6009,2606,81560,294,6,1036,14014,10878,519,11,46152,15132,2800,5512,22299,6316,945,383,324,11,514,74206,28800,11457,788,1647,95920,4068,274,17771,1376,978,514,72601,2092,12267,13,7695,1826,27138,409,48021,1765,2007,3625,52138,729,1744,7643,270,4558,325,30714,13,44723,2439,46131,4502,46152,15132,671,541,4893,9952,3625,436,1769,1744,503,34155,296,98279,2972,13,35141,3869,1317,79623,409,85434,11,6033,14707,15572,261,665,84871,649,20712,11,3371,2439,2442,57375,46131,1744,503,34155,2665,13532,5019,379,46131,1206,1334,7010,3846,1437,3159,38921,30,356,17771,7010,3625,737,4377,951,79991,11,272,17771,934,35329,78060,409,43905,73681,11,1744,951,96271,3930,72601,2092,12267,95287,306,665,43905,32022,13,15089,4039,437,13109,11,13080,1069,483,11,6316,37291,409,54606,409,7643,523,13559,11,503,6,40997,59976,665,7643,8198,304,28400,8511,11,4864,326,34155,10237,301,11,4864,326,34155,54776,13559,13,57895,40906,7010,1647,9511,67763,11,4864,326,34155,26555,285,11,4864,326,34155,834,788,11,4864,2457,15878,20028,409,7643,47283,283,569,11,1208,95480,1765,88026,409,15907,2211,6374,2249,13,11876,100246,1744,503,34155,100162,2389,404,479,3846,1744,326,54386,1207,1088,11,1208,357,56771,38672,451,1826,293,6181,1658,8047,5310,547,409,13026,4881,34065,44563,2142,13,9240,68,3869,46524,1208,357,56771,38672,451,7930,17317,282,592,7404,409,296,4618,35603,13,46706,20662,2748,978,9517,3002,11,1208,78422,4558,325,409,326,6,561,265,1612,276,13,27058,46524,20662,1488,7246,11,326,31109,951,75601,2601,1744,4864,52895,375,1826,326,57286,799,951,1589,9011,466,2848,51058,1765,653,4046,20609,68,259,6853,3920,454,11,7515,677,14559,13,5034,63683,409,20662,87810,11,4502,1208,32118,97495,9189,20272,47371,2784,11,272,17771,1744,514,2092,1826,514,296,8869,404,951,11679,31539,1880,7930,15132,16968,39015,2902,2784,13,3489,438,3869,1208,3488,7930,9189,1437,30872,273,11,1765,1208,73173,409,20662,43200,8511,11,503,26248,547,42676,665,9517,36634,3846,293,788,66,1130,11,272,17771,1208,296,1366,62117,81815,11,7515,677,14559,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,3077,5439,264,33894,477,264,6710,315,11782,4477,304,8753,11,323,358,3358,656,856,1888,311,3493,459,6498,14807,627,198,5618,5296,430,279,14807,2643,539,387,4832,11,439,279,1495,5727,1063,77361,4221,323,31768,1105,430,649,387,17436,311,15025,13,5810,596,856,4879,512,198,6153,856,69396,10,23,1667,4227,11,358,14896,311,9020,311,856,4851,13,9930,499,11,22969,323,33621,13,358,4934,311,3719,264,10896,13,358,1047,9958,304,856,6548,323,23902,2539,315,20349,13,7570,439,264,10585,11,358,574,22999,922,42142,3695,304,279,3776,13180,13,12471,677,14559,0,358,1511,10334,430,86228,3117,505,2162,13,2030,7170,11,5043,35603,4498,389,279,5015,11,653,14386,1639,13,7874,6305,11,814,17988,264,2763,13,2030,304,420,61137,5609,11,584,3358,1120,2019,330,39883,1,320,63666,705,4917,635,11,12471,677,14559,4999,198,791,3575,584,3663,449,1057,4333,12,831,288,374,539,1405,814,4498,11,719,279,58161,430,33427,1124
