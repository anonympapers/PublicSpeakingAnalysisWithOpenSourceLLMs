I'll try to summarize it for you.\n\nYou started by talking about your father's profession as a mechanic and how you were fascinated by the way he could fix cars. You then moved on to discuss the development of autonomous vehicles, mentioning that some modern cars are already equipped with advanced diagnostic systems.\n\nHowever, you also highlighted the potential risks associated with connected objects, such as vehicles being vulnerable to cyberattacks or viruses. In this context, you emphasized the importance of cybersecurity in protecting our lives and surrounding environments.\n\nThe main focus of your presentation was on your thesis about teaching a car to learn from its experiences. You described how a car has multiple components, including computers, electronics, and sensors that allow it to perceive, analyze, and make decisions. You then explained how you're working on developing algorithms and mathematical models to build an artificial intelligence system that simulates the immune system of an autonomous vehicle.\n\nYou drew parallels between this system and our human immune systems, highlighting the importance of both innate and adaptive immunity. Your goal is to develop an AI that can detect new attacks and learn from them, much like our immune systems do when they encounter new pathogens.\n\nTo achieve this, your AI system will monitor all communication between a car's components, trying to identify normal behavior patterns. If any anomalies are detected, the AI will trigger security measures to prevent potential threats.\n\nFinally, you ended by emphasizing the importance of technology in providing comfort and safety to our lives, but also acknowledging the need for cybersecurity to protect us from human mistakes or malicious attacks.\n\nOverall, your presentation was engaging and well-structured, covering a range of topics from autonomous vehicles to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
