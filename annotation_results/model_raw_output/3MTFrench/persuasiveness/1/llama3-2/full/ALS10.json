It's a pleasure to translate it.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n\"I'm reminded of a TV show called 'Rendez-vous in Unknown Territory,' where celebrities immerse themselves in the life of a distant population. That's similar to what I do, but without the media hype, that's anthropology! Anthropology is interested in different ways and customs, inviting us to put our own way of life into perspective. And me, I'm at the material unknown, imagine great mountains, a village at 3,500 meters altitude, a population of around 300 people. The population has had nothing easy, from which they have become ingrown, we are in a village in the Himalayas. This is where I spent several months living in immersion with an indigenous Tititee population. I laughed with these people, drank tea with them, spoke their language, why? Because it's the research method of my field of study, participant observation. You talk to people, you build trust, and they give you honest words.\n\nI don't hide from you that the first contact was a bit difficult. I remember, I knocked on the door of a village, and there was no response. Another village, I didn't see anything, it's just the usual, nothing special. In fact, it's not like our cities; we need to adjust ourselves. I didn't knock again. I sat in the family kitchen, four pairs of eyes looked at me with questioning gazes. They finally accepted me, they served me more jambois, and when I left, I don't know how to get back. But eventually, I settled into living with this family where there are two medical doctors from our village.\n\nSo what do I observe? I observe a significant intergenerational gap. There's the father, who still practices traditional medicine with his father. Meanwhile, his son has become well-educated and has access to more knowledge. He can travel to the West and practice modern medicine. And today, he travels and faces new visions of the world that bring him back to his village. This makes him question tradition, for example, making more use of these medicines, the entire medical system that goes with tourists on passage. Something that are perceived as not appreciated at first, but which might be accepted later.\n\nFinally, there's something in the father's words: 'Yes, sure, life in the village today is easier, but I don't see men like before, walking across the mountain, I wonder what will happen next to ensure our traditional healing methods if my son leaves this way.' So that's anthropology. It's observing how a society evolves, submerging ourselves in unknown territory to understand what makes us human beings.\"\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like any
