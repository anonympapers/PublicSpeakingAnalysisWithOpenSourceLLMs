They admit that they don't know what to say and that it's normal not to have all the answers.\n\nThe speaker then explains that assessing the ecological health of forests is a complex task, as scientists still struggle to understand whether a forest is doing well or not. They mention that just because there are no visible signs of degradation doesn't mean everything is okay. To really evaluate the state of the forest, one needs to look at things like the presence of certain species, the condition of the soil, and more.\n\nThe speaker then reveals their own research project, which aims to study ecosystems and biodiversity in forests using data from thousands of plant records collected over decades. They've been able to identify changes in some ecosystems that have shifted towards warmer conditions due to climate change (11% of forest ecosystems have evolved into warmer environments). This is significant because it highlights the need for action to protect these ecosystems.\n\nThe speaker concludes by saying that their team has been working to develop indicators for monitoring the ecological health of forests and that they're trying to compare protected forests with those that aren't. Their ultimate goal isn't just to understand how forests are doing, but to ensure they remain in good condition.\n\nOverall, this text is a lighthearted yet informative discussion about the challenges of assessing the ecological health of forests and the importance of taking action to protect them.
