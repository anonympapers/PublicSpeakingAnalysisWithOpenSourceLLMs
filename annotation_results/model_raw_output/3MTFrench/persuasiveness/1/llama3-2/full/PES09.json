The use of storytelling and vivid imagery helps to engage the audience and make the topic more relatable.\n\nTésar's reasoning is also rigorous, as they provide specific examples and explanations to support their claims. They demonstrate a clear understanding of the SPH method and its applications, which adds credibility to their argument.\n\nHowever, there are some areas for improvement:\n\n1. The speech could benefit from a clearer structure and more explicit connections between the different ideas presented.\n2. Some sentences are overly complex or convoluted, which may make it difficult for non-experts in the field to follow along.\n3. The tone is generally informal and conversational, but some parts of the speech feel like a lecture or a technical presentation. A balance between informality and formality would be beneficial.\n\nOverall, Tésar's speech effectively communicates their research interests and goals, making it an engaging and persuasive presentation.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\n\nNote: The transcript is in French, and my analysis is based on the English translation
