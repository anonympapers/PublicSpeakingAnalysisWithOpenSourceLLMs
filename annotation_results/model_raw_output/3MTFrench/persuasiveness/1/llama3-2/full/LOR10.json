I'll try to summarize it for you:\n\nThe speaker starts by saying that predicting the future is impossible, but he wants to preserve the future of France's forests. He notes that the forest's growth has increased over the past 150 years, but this growth could be threatened by climate change.\n\nTo better understand the future, the speaker uses a simulator to predict the amount of wood in French forests. He acknowledges that this simulator might not be entirely accurate, but he wants to improve it. The goal is to identify any brakes on forest growth and adapt forest management strategies accordingly.\n\nThe speaker identifies two main brakes: (1) competition between trees for light, and (2) climate change effects such as rising temperatures and decreased water availability. He uses a mathematical method to integrate these factors into the simulator.\n\nBy running simulations forward in time from 1980 to today, he can compare predicted wood quantities with actual data. If the predictions are accurate, it will help identify the competition between trees and climate change as key factors affecting forest growth.\n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing that predicting the future is crucial for making informed decisions about forest management. By doing so, we can ensure a sustainable future for our forests.\n\nOverall, this text showcases the importance of forward-thinking in environmental conservation, particularly when it comes to managing natural resources like forests in response to climate change.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,7930,1370,8318,9189,308,26248,56316,513,24560,74282,66014,4538,264,43406,11,7930,308,26248,56316,25774,1208,10485,34395,77818,817,6293,375,409,4538,8486,5019,7643,961,11,4864,259,6960,409,27389,4120,326,6,5389,404,409,1208,369,49530,93424,13,1708,1105,97507,11,3869,3846,357,1037,11,45441,9189,841,296,41901,7591,11,10071,3900,841,92215,6502,96308,27389,3826,37572,4502,389,1323,546,265,653,9880,665,55520,11,14896,12266,11,45441,9189,294,3695,10071,3869,75249,272,17771,54312,1744,1208,369,49530,274,53149,46651,2536,1880,9189,47592,86966,1133,73173,13,5034,10484,13109,409,66304,409,1208,369,49530,93424,19861,12826,41199,74699,5636,409,220,3965,8261,11,10071,653,8137,409,342,9011,2392,20662,14425,24918,369,49530,357,12339,11,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,27058,47929,3869,26077,1486,3625,369,5615,2641,15132,348,359,404,3869,96721,21430,11843,78432,2428,11,3900,1826,100243,294,6,8322,13154,28130,18111,324,13,4366,51173,11,4502,514,312,331,283,479,1826,46481,26633,26633,1099,5512,294,6,3457,220,508,8261,11,4068,3625,369,5615,2641,82133,23761,9517,351,404,13,2998,390,46302,3846,18111,324,17317,5019,26692,1097,73511,15171,326,6,351,7709,369,49530,357,12339,54401,294,31769,1126,3625,369,5615,2641,3869,296,31769,10036,1430,45973,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,2998,4799,285,519,11,1370,51173,11,3625,32118,5317,288,82711,87437,4635,333,4558,8135,7010,12155,369,5615,2641,13,27058,74282,66014,326,6,5389,404,409,1208,369,49530,11,4864,259,6,285,2536,6502,6316,30870,273,409,69084,3916,11,10071,653,38553,324,409,14425,24918,13,24703,38553,324,1826,13171,409,27389,3826,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,37923,409,1208,369,49530,93424,11,10071,4864,514,19724,3209,30052,294,93825,6316,4839,68,13,3206,436,57332,11412,23761,409,1208,32118,747,15171,13,27058,45602,11,4864,11412,60946,265,4502,326,58736,17194,951,3541,1354,3869,1208,14425,24918,369,49530,357,12339,13,48109,5019,3209,2439,75804,88253,934,35329,389,29253,26633,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,369,49530,27549,98375,11,1841,17258,1169,514,17258,346,11,17258,1169,1880,1167,569,82133,23761,665,75332,684,3625,1354,9952,3625,46106,5019,326,69537,12416,3869,1208,41263,20712,13,4366,51173,11,42067,24560,9189,12584,89,3869,1208,86451,1880,1744,73103,63484,1826,56662,409,38900,11,9189,12584,89,23761,665,75332,684,5019,48021,15265,4958,3978,668,8065,13612,321,13,2009,2132,22944,35977,87264,3625,3369,1441,3930,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,7695,513,4790,9425,306,1370,514,79885,951,2798,14081,2859,1880,1370,6316,48416,1516,409,326,93847,55852,13,1050,1055,2439,1765,20662,86451,11,9189,62299,1370,1055,84,3869,1153,261,15265,4958,3978,668,8065,13612,321,13,43987,26178,11,3900,20272,220,2983,1099,5512,1880,9189,308,6,52659,6502,294,93847,13,432,5512,495,266,9189,31547,5512,13,2998,5589,11,9189,9189,281,5615,35115,13,1708,1105,11,4068,47929,4502,27750,26633,1343,98078,4558,4978,9517,112916,79738,6033,2536,11,1208,14425,24918,409,1208,369,49530,93424,30,27058,45602,11,27549,1826,409,98652,7033,978,8637,2428,13,14465,91507,57110,911,261,3625,3369,1441,409,1208,75332,684,1880,66090,3930,2609,1133,11,1880,66090,3930,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,7010,514,92892,11067,13,2998,7591,42551,3625,47590,11,834,2439,665,220,777,1490,11,44829,665,2515,28674,54606,5553,514,18111,324,55398,81991,75804,88253,11,4864,94297,93455,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,550,15433,635,1370,514,92892,11067,9952,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,9517,301,1001,409,4958,3978,668,409,12155,49301,13,12095,3625,27389,2400,82,15132,4495,288,11,503,6,4202,2192,3608,90859,1208,75332,684,9465,3625,305,58566,1880,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,11,22299,14240,519,14707,951,1448,598,11,3869,326,6,4683,10722,409,1208,369,49530,93424,13,4366,1208,16578,11,389,1826,2515,28674,951,20492,1765,220,508,11,220,1135,1880,27584,220,1041,8261,13,2009,92892,11067,29557,2221,409,18728,34858,10253,1499,3457,31539,294,6,20311,3625,13033,919,665,26305,42463,951,19266,1072,1220,409,1913,11,1841,6316,37291,6502,220,5599,747,8047,11,10071,272,17771,294,6,9011,2727,1744,3846,15132,12155,60020,30179,812,7930,19477,9425,306,514,38900,409,2486,467,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,323,5016,1495,0,27623,226,1102,596,459,21308,15864,555,264,8753,2291,3751,389,279,3938,315,8753,36658,304,279,3663,315,10182,2349,13,358,3358,1456,311,63179,433,369,499,512,198,791,19114,8638,555,5605,430,52997,279,3938,374,12266,11,719,568,
