This sets the tone for discussing the theme of contracts on our bodies, which is a powerful metaphor.\n\nThe speaker highlights that there are many types of contracts we make with others, from medical treatments to tattoos, and that they all share a common thread: the obligation to present our bodies to someone else in exchange for some benefit. This raises important questions about our agency and autonomy over our own bodies.\n\nThe speaker also touches on the concept of rules governing these contracts, which is reminiscent of human rights and the principles of informed consent. They emphasize that we have the right to say \"no\" at any time if a contract becomes too burdensome or harmful.\n\nThe most striking part of the speech comes when the speaker discusses the issue of gestational surrogacy, where women are paid to carry someone else's child for them. This raises serious ethical questions about the commodification of human bodies and the treatment of children as objects.\n\nThroughout the speech, the speaker's passion and conviction shine through, making a compelling case for the importance of protecting our bodily autonomy and dignity. The call to action at the end is powerful: \"Let us work together to erase this phenomenon of the commodification of our bodies... Our bodies are not for sale, and we must protect what is most precious to us â€“ our human dignity.\"\n\nWhat do you think about the speaker's arguments? Do you agree that our bodies should be protected from commercialization?","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,43989,6316,37291,802,65220,1208,38920,274,47435,13,1219,2727,3900,9517,85,51453,409,409,43406,2854,8511,11,1208,25551,66,1291,25400,30714,653,88103,13,1252,4046,98872,86871,5019,67781,409,43678,829,7325,409,274,47435,665,26633,1689,645,503,3042,288,11,665,4046,3455,409,47929,665,523,5048,66167,13,5034,38920,274,47435,1046,12416,2442,12,6496,11,1880,1208,25551,66,1291,25400,88609,3869,1208,96282,13,41621,1391,48009,89,87320,514,88103,924,2816,1208,1589,46429,37953,447,35329,1826,86643,8047,8065,2126,372,13,34447,514,27138,4046,12821,361,409,9189,436,395,7889,11,841,9189,39904,6033,46777,9880,951,6155,1900,1765,29449,34922,13,4366,51173,11,87158,9189,9189,66651,46206,653,32118,8332,258,11,54401,934,35329,45441,6316,15265,34922,11,6033,14707,46206,653,259,67763,11,54401,934,35329,59157,1082,1765,15265,34922,514,60612,2665,13532,13,3206,42775,6824,68,3869,8678,805,409,13026,6155,1900,5019,61512,1765,514,34922,2854,467,11,54401,294,57286,664,1291,28130,71269,1104,13109,11,10071,76776,28130,5554,3748,799,13,622,34155,653,87674,1647,18027,934,35329,29253,294,22827,1486,34561,3869,26725,27750,6155,1900,13,39783,29672,409,27389,12,90427,1880,1765,514,34922,11,1880,653,68226,86374,22811,7584,261,1765,514,34922,13,356,8458,1879,57609,1744,326,54386,42182,44093,48021,4538,34922,3869,46096,294,31109,54613,5019,59157,12329,1208,864,20762,13,2998,54606,11,20662,54613,506,26724,653,68226,1765,29449,34922,11,22299,514,71546,5673,3675,7930,25692,6033,63346,1880,2098,12267,11083,514,34922,409,4538,11939,13,622,34155,76826,88817,75117,40744,3625,83229,86709,1081,8699,3869,15907,6155,1900,13,19421,39015,11,83229,86709,21901,2908,3916,1880,1744,17317,2145,72882,2439,294,22827,64079,36875,333,11,1327,396,333,13,64105,64,11,503,34155,33614,1744,9189,665,2278,978,87624,11,45602,1879,57609,934,81991,16968,4545,11,9189,47592,1208,67239,978,409,13510,11,2536,13,12095,514,259,67763,9189,20272,21965,5945,544,38315,11,9189,47592,514,64079,409,2098,882,934,35329,4751,483,829,864,20762,13,2998,5891,29097,11,4502,9189,308,6,52659,1744,1208,4647,12583,978,294,31109,83067,409,10237,11,259,349,39723,1826,1765,3625,281,9769,645,11,4864,9189,31025,4618,294,31769,1610,1565,23008,3869,26633,37291,13,11876,55056,288,409,20028,665,20028,757,44093,6316,961,409,45165,1018,978,13,19421,4864,51441,9189,1860,283,261,934,35329,29253,951,6155,1900,25945,58612,486,2249,13,622,34155,81186,14240,21178,978,3625,6155,1900,409,13033,367,5019,3154,81,2005,11,93224,84,3869,326,31769,376,4091,13,4366,3625,447,2053,6316,18694,60172,653,33632,519,45973,9517,26046,53301,11,54401,409,514,1323,7211,265,10253,3290,275,17724,13,62463,6155,1900,3242,9769,2641,10253,682,351,5512,357,978,376,285,15132,85633,3904,811,1880,83229,70,1001,306,27584,829,17536,1877,31037,13,3489,438,3869,326,41901,61827,11,3900,1826,18027,978,22299,653,31260,13,62463,6155,1900,15132,35597,958,2400,82,514,74206,55467,11,10071,5019,42463,294,22827,409,27138,13,356,17771,87320,503,34155,63669,409,9189,11,10071,294,22827,1167,17060,20243,53819,11,5019,40126,11,17317,9517,39833,3869,665,436,1155,3846,1343,98078,48099,409,15572,438,8082,13,44564,34922,308,17771,13080,3869,326,88766,10610,3675,3869,19189,265,11,1880,5019,51913,2058,1744,3625,78422,14081,811,37923,11,841,3567,72,89810,951,272,17278,1590,11,17317,3567,2439,1760,978,1414,3846,1744,17317,57038,409,5636,51625,53819,13,44564,28677,13109,2854,8511,11,16888,72,3869,26725,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,323,3463,10039,85,10979,8982,4999,198,791,19114,8638,555,11890,279,3446,315,264,2697,4809,46342,889,3727,264,3568,449,264,25551,69981,311,3719,3823,304,9473,369,1077,26139,7899,13,1115,7437,279,16630,369,25394,279,7057,315,17517,389,1057,13162,11,902,374,264,8147,46450,627,198,791,19114,22020,430,1070,527,1690,4595,315,17517,584,1304,449,3885,11,505,6593,22972,311,54742,11,323,430,814,682,4430,264,4279,4617,25,279,29672,311,3118,1057,13162,311,4423,775,304,9473,369,1063,8935,13,1115,25930,3062,4860,922,1057,9266,323,51360,927,1057,1866,13162,627,198,791,19114,1101,29727,389,279,7434,315,5718,10217,1521,17517,11,902,374,56085,315,3823,3268,323,279,16565,315,16369,14771,13,2435,47032,430,584,617,279,1314,311,2019,330,2201,1,520,904,892,422,264,5226,9221,2288,64074,638,477,28856,627,198,791,1455,21933,961,315,279,8982,4131,994,279,19114,35434,279,4360,315,13033,1697,1765,12
