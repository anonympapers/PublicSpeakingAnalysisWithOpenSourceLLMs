The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as metaphors (e.g., \"R2-2, c'est un peu le coup de Tossuisse des robots\") and storytelling to engage the audience. They also show enthusiasm and passion for their topic, which is infectious.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speech could be improved:\n\n1. **Lack of clear structure**: The speaker jumps between different ideas and concepts without a clear thread or logical flow. This makes it difficult to follow the argument.\n2. **Overuse of colloquial language**: While using colloquial expressions like \"T-Bouch en 4.0\" can be engaging, it may not resonate with everyone, especially if they are not familiar with French pop culture.\n3. **Too much repetition**: The speaker repeats themselves multiple times, which becomes tedious and detracts from the overall impact of their message.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\n\n[Translation]\n\nGood evening everyone. I think today, most of you know R2-2. But for those who do, we'll go back on one of its pros during the Star Wars saga. Yes, it's a bit like the Swiss army knife of robots, always there when needed and always ready to adapt. If a monster appears, it knows how to deal with it. If a rule is requested, it rearranges its spaceship in the middle of combat. In fact, we can say that it adapts to whatever situation arises, whether it's the T-Bouch en 4.0 or the most advanced surveillance system.\n\nNow imagine if two people adapted to you. Me, I think there are some of you out there who are GDI (General Dynamics Innovations). They have the power with them, which allows them to move objects at a distance, influence others, and even anticipate future events. You might be a GDI. But then there's the public that is afraid, and well, it's R2-D2, and we'll make sure he knows and adapts.\n\nAnd that's what my thesis subject is about: how to adapt a robot's behavior or skills to someone else's abilities and desires. How do you make this happen? Because defining a Japanese competence is high-level stuff. And for R2-D2, it's even higher level because it's an octuple robot. However, knowing whether you're going forward or not with new technologies is something the robot can do. It observes and compares you to profiles, from beginner to experienced, using indicators that it cultivates directly itself, based on these sensors.\n\nAnd that's where I'm currently working, trying to identify these different profiles based on a panel of robot users. Once the profiles are defined, we'll link them to the type of platform, whether mobile or not, and their functionality, more or less autonomous. So that it starts with the person, but also when needed, it's the best and most sociable. One could say that's all well and good, but not at all, because adapting and learning from everything is what R2-D2 must detect.\n\nTo know if a profile isn't the right choice for him and always be the best one, he needs to change. But I see some of you who are a bit skeptical, wondering if I'm just having my head in the stars with my robots. That's fine. It's when 2017, we counted two robots per square meter in France, and that number has increased by 16% since then. There are even some entrepreneurs who have wanted to totally robotize Russia, only to realize at the end that the greatest force of robots was human beings. It's because they convince us of one thing: it will be man-centered in the future, both in industry and agriculture. And he will share his work with one or more robots. So that the robot can understand its teammate, which will allow the man and the robot to work together.\n\n---\n\nPlease note that this translation is provided for general purposes only and may not
