The speaker effectively uses storytelling by sharing an anecdote about Frédéric's experience with purchasing software for his company, highlighting the issues he faced and the importance of identifying hidden costs. The speaker also presents her research methodology and goals clearly, showing her expertise in the field and dedication to finding a solution. However, some parts of the speech are quite technical, making it slightly more challenging for the audience to fully grasp the message. Nonetheless, overall, the persuasive elements outweigh the less clear sections.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,14527,462,13150,267,340,6960,26289,28725,2218,290,13139,634,3913,19797,2505,1921,4652,28891,631,28733,1014,324,911,340,3559,522,1289,27424,28723,2661,337,264,347,14158,14245,281,28742,370,340,11844,3913,19797,28725,461,28742,1585,6419,11693,28797,1361,4652,13165,521,264,631,424,324,911,1521,290,28742,28708,6567,677,28797,3670,526,28742,309,6783,934,4266,28797,28723,1700,268,8882,1415,11408,755,297,3762,1651,28723,1361,4652,13165,264,7166,5685,281,28742,1344,360,462,19341,11408,755,2669,462,2372,7380,28723,935,2308,28711,6813,324,6783,8395,28797,28705,28783,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,317,22751,28725,521,20638,2308,28711,6813,324,6783,8395,28797,28705,28740,28734,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,317,22751,28725,12986,5086,1233,28721,883,1361,4652,13165,264,2183,10867,20948,3025,6783,8395,1022,28705,28783,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,317,22751,28725,19255,12811,16700,15349,2219,7944,485,2211,5731,28723,16549,3670,955,1361,4652,13165,307,28742,494,1022,3557,15053,363,441,28723,334,28742,374,543,4630,3974,1415,11408,755,3025,818,28714,3580,1514,6002,1189,9603,911,277,28742,23133,16018,361,4346,462,318,1182,28797,28723,12494,5497,1514,6935,363,497,3025,435,268,28742,321,783,2487,3557,911,3025,6205,12599,1514,6819,1289,543,379,1352,8462,28723,334,28742,374,543,660,424,340,484,2728,267,281,28742,2146,10024,3025,10979,24087,1415,6727,634,597,4854,282,12035,911,6719,28733,28753,4550,1361,4652,13165,307,28742,494,1022,3557,724,8507,28718,28705,10456,28723,2316,358,955,28705,10456,3670,307,28742,374,3557,724,8507,28718,2422,1514,11408,23029,911,1514,575,4544,634,264,338,1449,911,481,3285,277,28742,374,15053,2800,294,546,1289,484,335,898,263,28723,976,734,4517,2265,263,1514,484,14779,28804,13542,9628,277,28742,374,28705,10456,305,28742,2814,335,340,4128,306,26289,28723,3291,11716,278,521,968,24265,10637,281,28742,20044,1514,2506,782,1717,15300,911,1514,2506,782,277,595,1442,911,2218,11716,278,3670,968,24265,2422,2219,3913,9266,2505,6578,340,2372,1289,28705,10456,28723,330,2704,2219,13138,362,350,7851,340,26590,631,28725,20288,28725,2300,1082,2959,15663,481,1610,7971,2110,1147,462,968,24265,1859,691,28733,26390,294,26601,28797,940,1514,1957,9892,1726,28725,637,363,973,28725,264,488,4473,28725,2058,5560,2959,497,911,1514,17729,18707,631,1726,340,305,28742,17218,271,28723,3291,16906,1949,1651,28723,475,28742,1646,311,490,634,264,631,424,1726,634,3559,2561,1289,28705,10456,634,25090,19371,28723,3291,10441,1493,5224,911,2218,5902,28706,634,5227,697,4109,279,5087,28725,4664,279,5087,4552,28710,9603,28723,475,28742,28149,331,4346,3418,28710,543,25715,5308,267,298,28710,28725,462,305,536,28705,10456,2669,11716,536,1326,968,24265,28723,4603,4550,1289,8821,1289,3670,968,24265,28723,334,28742,374,3913,9266,8403,2237,4536,12761,263,1415,9877,575,309,10637,281,28742,20044,1514,26336,1147,1514,2506,28714,815,1053,340,28541,911,1147,305,28742,8974,5463,1147,462,28541,28723,13542,2218,16906,1424,28713,462,1448,262,2422,543,854,361,28723,3291,1776,278,521,968,24265,1859,691,28733,26390,294,3588,936,8090,28725,25386,1514,3913,19797,7286,16065,1514,3345,1289,28705,10456,28725,634,2545,3378,340,6388,278,281,28742,28797,638,28725,2058,2561,281,28742,20044,28725,2306,28714,572,274,1289,28705,10456,28725,305,28742,10750,572,1147,1514,4331,340,28541,911,1147,305,28742,8974,5463,28723,13542,28705,10456,28725,16906,7414,20650,3557,955,28705,10456,4536,2265,263,1514,4331,340,11198,2505,28541,28723,4709,733,28748,16289,28793,17158,356,272,2078,1203,2489,28725,315,682,4338,272,14861,293,9992,302,272,8666,390,264,28705,28781,356,272,5657,302,28705,28740,298,28705,28782,28723,415,17153,11466,6098,2838,28707,3572,486,10681,396,396,760,28715,1590,684,1361,4652,13165,28742,28713,2659,395,21320,3930,354,516,2496,28725,12144,288,272,4382,400,12565,304,272,9545,302,21653,7918,6966,28723,415,17153,835,15890,559,3332,2038,2161,304,7661,6315,28725,8102,559,14900,297,272,1834,304,5589,3696,298,7484,264,5165,28723,2993,28725,741,5099,302,272,8666,460,3448,10067,28725,2492,378,7191,680,14361,354,272,7938,298,5894,22055,272,2928,28723,9187,19159,28725,7544,28725,272,14861,293,495,5176,575,769,956,272,2108,3081,12458,28723],"total_duration":82471927404,"load_duration":193309,"prompt_eval_coun
