They provide clear reasoning and evidence for why this is important, emphasizing the potential health risks for consumers. The language used is clear and concise, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of metaphors and analogies (such as comparing the chlorinated hydrocarbons to a wolf) also helps to make the information more engaging and memorable. Overall, the speaker effectively crafts a persuasive message that is both informative and compelling.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,2661,10559,2219,15396,28725,14956,5408,1046,1001,338,1053,28723,393,28742,552,14886,10559,2144,284,581,19465,28725,526,28742,3222,435,8631,28728,1022,3285,1514,1233,2303,28797,28723,976,734,1521,744,749,340,543,5408,570,484,300,8110,28725,911,484,323,370,634,14956,1001,338,1053,427,2367,1289,11716,536,637,430,1779,5359,266,28723,16035,877,386,2457,28725,2219,877,1105,28718,2457,911,2219,877,2152,2457,28723,1337,305,14245,488,281,28742,501,316,28797,434,28718,536,1514,6935,5359,1053,8159,274,340,5881,8878,340,1359,278,28725,427,353,543,5359,266,877,2152,1651,2765,12163,926,17969,28723,8105,27423,28725,3809,4828,10404,14956,5408,1046,1001,338,1053,5672,936,3378,28723,2280,267,9877,1001,338,266,10559,462,363,1375,481,4031,262,2423,1147,2219,26790,3222,281,28742,663,1105,28723,334,28742,374,459,267,1001,338,266,911,1521,337,264,2219,5359,266,340,5881,11619,28723,1337,27824,6783,10559,462,15221,481,4031,262,2423,16366,28797,521,290,2374,749,28723,2661,264,2219,5359,266,340,1359,278,28723,1337,4056,10867,8158,10559,462,15221,2422,634,287,28891,7452,788,281,28742,301,28728,465,28725,12062,18837,28052,932,3781,1289,305,28742,1205,21641,2422,2219,5359,266,340,287,6424,28723,315,1189,28725,459,267,3487,13138,11746,305,14245,28725,277,28742,374,543,533,431,634,379,4511,28723,1700,533,431,634,379,4511,934,521,16918,12414,3025,264,7166,4479,17218,5672,936,3378,2669,305,10112,13791,521,25782,465,324,1415,8743,276,1296,28723,365,1375,526,28742,4544,5497,791,28715,1046,14661,3285,340,28705,28750,28734,8804,28725,1966,4479,5463,264,8667,279,2219,27702,26200,634,2128,28713,2669,17071,1595,17251,281,28742,830,4473,28723,17365,290,28906,28714,2110,13463,424,15053,11311,28725,5756,2110,2422,462,2128,28725,427,5998,520,2505,28486,2959,4601,911,5672,4691,4601,3025,264,4155,24454,1415,2128,3466,634,27863,274,679,8255,1442,28723,2661,934,19477,2278,340,1773,8878,1289,543,27863,352,911,2505,2085,1116,634,1001,338,1053,2669,955,462,305,14245,435,940,28728,10605,3557,1289,10441,3754,28723,1700,533,431,634,379,4511,427,8052,28725,6702,1521,24533,11983,6273,267,28725,462,21894,363,28840,631,679,8255,28797,481,9877,28723,418,385,6935,5146,3378,1001,338,1053,28725,28705,8668,363,24087,481,4031,473,2423,28725,5497,2505,3754,1863,340,1415,2128,28723,13542,481,19893,2457,2422,462,2128,28725,19255,363,677,481,4155,3160,263,28723,1337,305,14245,12122,940,1434,361,1289,1514,438,424,507,267,28723,976,734,955,459,267,1001,338,266,934,2422,2219,5359,266,340,287,6424,28725,307,28742,374,3557,2505,3754,1415,2128,28723,3189,28717,1843,10594,263,1289,543,10250,6915,1390,28723,1124,1127,2422,305,28742,25291,5016,883,28725,462,305,14245,435,2669,520,3557,438,424,507,267,28723,16549,2669,364,3950,934,28733,358,2144,2278,340,16249,1685,955,543,533,431,634,379,4511,12688,2505,3754,1415,1001,338,266,1550,365,1375,2144,8273,337,12688,28725,8273,679,21928,543,3074,5224,911,2144,305,28742,11966,1127,543,676,490,28725,1521,427,679,21928,1289,1966,3884,28723,13542,481,268,28742,4373,383,353,440,2422,305,28742,8974,10425,28725,543,533,431,634,379,4511,12122,1130,28709,10376,634,6125,316,497,28725,634,430,1231,27973,340,16559,309,3974,940,26260,28725,3466,16921,634,541,15148,28723,15540,12823,4323,543,268,440,28797,1415,1102,26712,10229,28725,1521,285,1228,19477,3264,670,536,543,679,25914,340,305,28742,1058,28719,982,634,1219,1046,27863,10024,28723,13542,16906,462,3264,3086,3552,28764,28725,2218,290,28742,501,28797,25848,3285,23590,8110,466,5672,5408,1046,1001,338,1053,28723,334,28742,374,1289,3247,1289,543,3074,5224,340,25509,28723,475,28742,409,24195,340,23913,267,4517,543,10250,6915,1390,934,1255,15149,28797,2422,305,28742,8974,10425,911,4517,8273,481,934,1233,2788,262,2110,28723,330,2704,3670,1326,1928,335,911,340,11716,536,521,2808,281,28742,282,3076,1082,24476,28725,340,5998,28707,28725,14632,28707,440,340,724,4652,536,1514,8902,697,2422,305,28742,2959,279,441,2505,19780,1415,12974,28723,330,2704,3670,968,24265,28725,2218,2669,26305,13255,8639,7236,2422,526,3222,752,2864,3756,462,1448,28710,340,543,4676,8986,267,462,1001,338,266,28725,911,268,28742,309,305,28742,1061,416,28725,12971,744,309,676,490,440,340,9877,1550,28705,29215,28708,12122,11983,28725,1966,12459,412,3466,16921,1966,461
