{"model":"mistral","created_at":"2024-04-06T19:30:00.926536721Z","response":" Based on the given transcript, I would evaluate the persuasiveness of the speech as follows: 3\n\nThe speaker provides a clear and compelling argument about the need to transform the higher education system to better prepare students for professional life. They present their own experiences and insights from working with educators at their university to support their claims. However, they also acknowledge that simply implementing innovative practices is not enough, and emphasize the importance of collaboration among all actors involved in the educational process.\n\nDespite this persuasive message, the speech could be improved by using more concise language and avoiding repetition. The speaker's use of French idioms and expressions may also make it less accessible to some audiences. Overall, while the argument is persuasive, there are areas where the delivery could be stronger to maximize its impact.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,3291,363,1555,16906,15349,2219,1885,4609,28725,12410,1011,461,28742,1585,901,831,28797,4128,306,26289,28725,2218,528,3564,521,12631,3670,526,28742,4544,805,14954,274,28723,3291,519,278,281,28742,581,310,7093,2237,481,27824,2232,2110,28725,5359,2218,519,278,11631,15188,425,3228,8235,19065,1651,1289,305,28742,21426,3974,340,543,22152,2805,291,28723,13542,1289,3670,20360,28725,2218,26035,13861,340,1326,17559,281,28742,22276,697,28723,451,715,1472,23097,28725,28705,10456,4536,11983,390,331,28764,3252,546,1289,319,3160,263,16065,1514,25662,28723,1618,12974,28725,15188,425,3228,8235,19065,1651,28725,461,28742,323,3086,8998,1514,481,331,603,1549,340,305,28742,21426,3974,2422,543,12958,340,10441,724,24476,28723,16549,281,3387,28733,28719,3950,28725,526,3222,934,305,28742,28706,2138,291,340,305,28742,1058,603,1116,1461,21641,2505,18777,28715,28742,24281,28804,28705,29215,28708,14791,17496,28725,2422,1326,5137,3974,28725,356,23604,3228,955,305,28742,269,2099,28718,934,13031,3974,28725,305,28742,6889,296,7585,8062,281,28742,370,3285,3487,8581,281,28742,2959,11091,1549,28723,1667,960,3009,1044,28725,356,779,380,955,459,267,18874,8158,281,28742,1058,603,1116,284,13139,1289,3264,19571,267,1289,521,18408,481,2099,28718,28725,4346,634,3763,11091,1549,3025,16065,1514,319,596,3025,340,305,28742,21426,3974,5497,890,452,28906,4137,28725,3466,3025,435,7414,1071,3557,281,28742,2713,5628,1289,543,24373,7093,340,10441,4109,2500,28723,2661,934,19477,4273,2383,2669,305,28742,21426,3974,340,427,5516,263,28723,17365,12958,1558,645,1147,521,481,331,603,1116,1595,9946,1843,3285,1147,462,8639,7236,28725,5359,1147,1514,3763,11091,1549,6783,28733,26333,28723,1325,3810,28840,28707,1116,28725,526,28742,374,28733,358,955,28705,10456,1492,335,412,28804,13542,9628,28725,356,4536,21226,487,634,284,4652,19065,412,960,1771,28725,22789,1415,28541,481,4388,28146,28725,2669,14632,4110,1289,305,28742,2959,11091,1549,340,21226,487,634,623,2959,2119,8986,1139,2422,462,15004,7585,8062,28723,2661,337,264,634,319,596,1289,5813,1606,3334,28713,340,1957,526,28742,266,363,288,28707,28733,28717,4405,3025,264,2365,3160,2487,634,724,270,4030,8403,6682,28723,16549,934,28733,358,955,277,4403,3510,279,1289,5516,263,462,18874,8158,28804,20828,1116,3557,28725,8466,2306,7971,28797,28725,19477,340,3557,457,340,22789,25060,9777,4473,28725,1289,2219,3264,3222,5516,2110,1147,9130,634,724,270,4030,2422,305,28742,4138,6529,28723,13542,6702,461,28742,28708,545,1514,19907,278,28725,277,28742,374,462,519,8358,340,4128,306,26289,28723,16549,4517,949,1079,521,481,331,603,1116,526,28742,309,337,1514,307,28742,374,10274,3557,18354,14661,28705,28750,28734,8804,28725,281,28742,375,7256,1079,634,6189,5887,634,6356,1303,28723,15540,3418,28710,28725,1966,543,6380,281,28742,1802,24303,2562,3974,340,305,28742,834,1375,26590,631,28725,1521,307,28742,28724,264,3557,340,12958,2572,28723,2661,307,28742,28724,264,3557,340,6380,2562,19682,2572,28725,2144,356,307,28742,28708,10274,3557,1514,481,331,603,1549,1289,1233,338,3689,911,1289,467,1750,8878,17236,466,28723,451,1724,28725,481,3013,462,430,1231,8158,28725,277,28742,374,955,305,28742,1058,603,1116,934,2219,3853,3974,15053,2128,19682,28723,976,734,4517,268,28742,28724,16086,267,28804,3217,8178,999,26289,934,526,28742,309,285,1228,1424,4110,1514,1338,4511,481,1885,4609,28725,2669,526,28742,3222,427,2662,28706,10637,340,268,28742,980,1742,2422,11844,5902,12843,28723,6068,2306,3479,631,4817,28706,1289,14791,263,634,5902,12843,340,28541,4346,1514,481,331,603,1549,2208,677,10024,911,15349,481,3127,28706,955,11844,5902,12843,716,28840,28721,1139,20458,466,521,26130,7950,279,1147,462,481,331,603,440,28725,5359,11631,634,1338,20408,5466,270,12843,28725,634,960,16465,1415,15004,2809,1233,2868,1651,28725,911,9628,1233,14410,366,466,634,3763,11091,1549,28723,365,1013,28725,305,28742,1058,28719,982,634,960,16465,2669,2219,3264,3222,12958,1415,18874,8158,28725,911,277,28742,374,26941,11109,28705,10456,427,3852,1651,28723,2316,358,955,3418,28710,11631,28725,2218,26035,13861,1415,18874,8158,28723,976,734,16906,8477,28764,528,3247,5359,4517,12122,28733,8437,955,8582,1683,278,2219,26590,631,3716,911,285,6109,28723,13542,9628,28725,2218,363,1555,290,790,634,936,1441,12306,911,634,2652,411,
