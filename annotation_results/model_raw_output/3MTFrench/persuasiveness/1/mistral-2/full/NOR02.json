{"model":"mistral","created_at":"2024-04-06T21:04:33.866009655Z","response":" Based on the given transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as a 4. The speaker presents several compelling examples and arguments to support their thesis, such as the comparison between farmers and office workers in terms of health, and the importance of understanding all aspects of a farmer's professional life to evaluate potential health risks. They also provide some initial data and methods for analyzing the relationship between exposures and diseases. However, there are some sections where the argumentation could be more rigorous, such as the lack of clear connection between the list of suspects and the presence of ignorance or the need to consider other factors beyond just professional exposures that might impact health. Overall, the speech is persuasive but could benefit from some additional clarity and evidence to strengthen its arguments.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,19442,5436,28747,320,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,3315,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,7178,1702,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,955,16906,363,280,19557,16906,15349,3285,16796,28725,2219,2996,19538,2669,16110,526,28742,266,549,13768,28725,955,305,28742,266,264,8466,268,28742,308,416,28718,2505,17775,2219,15396,2669,281,28742,370,438,5973,28797,28723,28462,1011,461,28742,25545,278,3285,2218,1802,28725,2669,290,28742,28708,1184,1289,3264,19571,267,1289,8821,2996,28725,356,15188,2457,28120,340,2183,278,361,521,21065,749,955,461,28742,269,28712,28876,867,28725,955,277,4403,379,4323,1022,4128,268,440,28797,28723,8693,2218,307,28742,1585,3557,12090,481,4031,262,340,363,385,2306,2415,497,7585,28711,8668,955,461,28742,1585,5153,15349,14850,28742,28839,23428,28725,1521,3546,982,3264,483,440,955,3670,15188,309,307,28742,28708,2614,722,3557,1289,8466,481,484,323,370,28723,13542,955,305,28742,314,423,340,1966,21065,749,435,18696,1742,1022,3557,481,22611,5813,1606,12974,637,268,440,28797,28723,7809,8110,26260,28725,462,16018,357,9946,2320,424,324,28120,8773,8269,940,17951,936,311,1046,28725,19255,5497,3526,1116,481,24515,324,268,440,28797,955,543,3264,3971,1289,4889,28723,25311,285,2150,17775,28725,19255,16720,6188,3285,28723,15540,28707,440,28725,19255,3546,1231,308,3264,4970,282,1116,526,28742,4544,579,722,3285,597,3665,274,955,281,28742,494,7236,2552,274,2439,8776,28723,393,28742,308,520,2487,28725,1514,305,28742,269,28722,28906,4137,307,28742,677,340,3670,526,28742,309,337,264,28723,2535,541,15148,1183,18924,3053,3025,261,14924,23749,28713,3601,2464,340,459,267,15166,25791,1442,1289,13662,19907,416,267,13791,1514,15022,28725,1514,281,572,28797,2040,28723,976,734,28725,4517,467,1750,8878,28725,12122,28733,309,481,17262,16233,10441,268,440,28797,28804,13542,9628,28725,277,28742,374,8466,305,28742,3710,299,340,4128,306,26289,28725,23913,267,526,28742,8668,5497,1514,10760,28797,1339,28725,27595,15300,281,28742,262,17262,16233,543,5465,1375,3466,340,3601,274,481,285,2150,22440,1514,11885,353,424,1726,28723,3291,26035,358,955,1326,25929,340,305,28742,28797,9507,4854,412,7851,28723,689,13768,1610,262,28725,2218,528,1514,481,28714,24893,543,284,1590,28733,338,3228,28733,2220,28733,28721,1145,28723,976,734,28725,543,14102,3763,1748,24533,1846,263,543,1274,28706,340,12236,28723,5288,2148,28725,2144,7581,13139,16906,307,28742,28708,482,28764,3557,2669,1206,440,3247,955,284,522,28725,261,28742,269,3564,1289,543,9671,2585,281,28742,2164,12305,28723,334,4403,305,28742,4373,383,2677,340,724,28876,1074,3466,281,28742,20390,14632,1947,340,2306,3013,361,3466,1843,28725,305,28742,323,715,370,6572,3974,281,28742,1126,381,822,28723,384,28742,14286,1726,28725,2144,1326,12811,308,28725,543,1274,28706,268,28742,316,488,267,462,15004,1043,441,28723,9779,19780,340,10441,11198,7585,28711,3222,28725,1514,11885,353,424,1726,6205,23749,274,4514,281,28742,8668,28733,28726,28891,1927,340,5679,28725,28120,1514,6935,481,10274,12974,28723,13542,28725,285,1228,13417,8466,521,22936,340,261,28891,1927,8125,274,1233,1122,28714,749,274,28723,3523,328,2097,5497,634,4691,4601,28725,8429,340,284,9546,1926,28725,940,1326,667,10721,634,284,9546,1926,28723,2661,26766,634,559,28726,294,1926,28725,634,16918,294,1926,28725,634,8987,28713,340,16240,28725,3285,340,2120,291,10250,28797,21649,23749,274,28723,475,28742,1585,19477,3432,2448,340,379,1520,22481,305,28742,1058,28719,982,340,543,11198,7585,28711,3222,634,11885,353,424,1726,2669,23913,267,2505,15216,1554,2669,934,4156,911,1233,1052,3807,2505,15216,1554,1514,8159,28713,340,484,323,1802,340,11844,10594,2065,1147,543,5231,2864,1651,3601,274,5227,28706,28723,4380,265,482,24862,28725,3557,340,5599,5270,28797,462,12974,28723,976,734,28725,4517,8639,7236,3025,934,3466,264,7166,10594,28797,1289,526,3950,28804,475,28742,1585,305,28742,8645,5143,340,7579,1289,4128,704,3640,28725,543,290,4854,10710,340,28705,28740,28783,28734,28705,28734,28734,28734,3004,381,28723,7205,274,467,1750,425,308,340,26708,3466,340,1448,262,2422,462,15004,1289,9261,17973,28723,4603,4550,28733,28694,911,5672,25090,697,15036,4030,28725,2218,363,1555,261,7262,340,23913,267,526,1190,5497,1514,3136,2588,1549,3913,10594,2065,911,954,2923,5091,340,543,6125,316,412,28723,1700,484,1475,3974,340,4128,306,26289,528,1493,5224,340,3264,28728,280,28723,4287,1434,361,14221,955,462,9311,435,18488,901,278,28723,45
