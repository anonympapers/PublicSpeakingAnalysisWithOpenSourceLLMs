The speaker presents some interesting and unique ideas about how ticks communicate with each other, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While they mention that ticks produce cryptic messages for each other, they do not provide any concrete examples or scientific studies to back up this claim. Adding more empirical evidence to the argument would make it more persuasive.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments and criticisms of their theory. For example, some scientists may argue that the complexity of tick communication is overstated, or that there is not enough evidence to support the idea of a widespread language among ticks. Addressing these criticisms directly and providing a clear response would make the argument more convincing.\n\nFinally, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic of tick communication. While they mention that ticks are able to communicate through chemical signals, they do not provide any information on how this works or why it is important. Providing more context and background information would help to make the argument more compelling.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas about tick communication, there are areas where the argument could be strengthened to make it more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,17043,5582,29920,9411,29871,1654,966,7105,1446,867,1355,29889,1551,452,269,29915,9864,277,867,9061,29899,1808,29892,454,17887,282,21167,1249,29892,454,17887,521,4085,332,427,16053,479,29889,8748,6079,19601,29892,1444,16391,712,7015,298,5137,2658,3435,8388,21659,9230,29889,1459,346,712,10814,29892,712,454,17887,282,21167,1249,818,5663,8885,1487,26786,29892,2257,9122,707,17887,5777,453,283,270,29915,5753,536,29889,5462,454,17887,521,4085,332,427,16053,479,29892,7847,339,29915,265,285,9568,872,4595,29899,29885,1908,2535,443,301,1132,29892,1671,339,7768,2331,1577,751,392,29871,4277,29892,966,867,9061,29899,4999,409,285,465,296,4332,332,1249,610,1597,7319,455,1908,1750,13901,1465,1597,18234,427,6788,553,282,1575,29892,6701,29871,4277,29892,1444,26099,544,284,3544,29948,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,980,707,4963,942,2411,575,519,712,9411,7015,15001,1179,4940,13546,2298,3711,381,316,6267,8714,1465,425,363,11992,29892,7209,18413,409,9073,472,941,7808,610,553,7629,29879,6079,2298,1841,514,743,4191,443,29889,2664,260,3783,29892,966,260,3783,3435,316,27128,1849,544,14125,1465,966,339,1379,316,270,574,406,1509,289,627,4745,409,8957,296,9411,966,16283,1671,10503,440,276,29889,11948,992,309,30001,29892,1597,10098,610,385,12471,29892,425,260,1387,16374,409,302,473,12416,427,29871,29953,29900,29900,454,13625,270,29915,273,1690,326,744,29889,478,681,29892,610,17488,29892,18729,6664,993,818,19612,12416,427,4595,301,29915,29948,13732,868,26520,277,550,631,29892,14735,424,818,18402,289,627,4745,818,301,29915,524,14508,1597,8825,316,269,29915,5903,1664,29889,1876,663,8532,1597,27128,519,3236,818,425,17176,29948,29892,1465,22025,4963,942,9411,966,3581,567,3435,3635,275,29892,425,15481,371,707,274,2131,1091,793,712,3058,267,316,7015,289,627,4745,4625,844,3977,29948,818,269,29915,9979,13241,1671,5256,7608,10713,521,2925,316,4084,568,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,3479,904,29876,583,970,29879,954,10651,29871,29896,712,301,29915,265,5663,6223,1465,425,260,1387,29889,2664,3581,567,4625,367,585,1841,492,575,29892,634,1354,11797,3435,427,17949,553,1029,333,307,305,5908,29892,6079,274,29915,342,2331,2257,1750,707,316,1487,5544,519,316,425,4439,328,347,316,301,29915,29882,25395,29889,2661,29899,346,439,29915,309,286,29915,29874,443,26842,11992,818,409,1936,8584,29892,274,29915,342,316,4048,6390,1354,966,3581,567,953,4089,15817,575,20423,3817,29875,7808,2637,23778,29889,1459,346,712,2123,29875,29892,966,289,627,4745,5695,29892,2331,409,610,1358,29889,6803,18729,29892,20554,325,609,1391,533,553,6062,29948,21337,9200,21785,3783,29892,439,29915,4999,4625,443,17887,7006,760,449,26269,270,29915,1808,29889,12390,6062,29948,21337,3435,427,22259,2131,553,7191,24941,2406,1750,8556,325,609,7848,7199,275,634,6613,743,29892,1750,4625,966,289,627,4745,818,301,29915,296,473,1750,4625,301,29915,29948,401,1671,1437,305,361,1341,261,454,2643,29889,315,29915,342,443,17887,7006,4191,24145,26138,2730,11771,316,3817,29875,7808,818,269,29915,264,4951,882,29889,2664,286,1862,19154,966,7191,24941,2406,29892,634,966,28374,6361,1041,1750,1863,296,1465,454,9122,29892,966,11561,1671,966,1437,305,361,1341,261,29889,365,29915,3318,361,7017,316,611,266,17449,707,270,29915,24430,316,286,29915,465,9945,712,966,3581,567,953,4089,15817,575,610,484,454,6701,6361,482,634,1487,2245,15390,316,2257,7199,9030,29889,1174,610,497,15340,29892,1444,6427,8284,8648,818,7697,276,966,3581,567,953,4089,15817,575,3887,1691,427,966,878,361,743,6094,1893,8105,882,1671,966,3710,30037,4630,316,1391,533,6267,2643,24941,29948,29889,365,29915,333,1318,29892,29871,4277,2947,7848,1437,29881,566,1000,553,26278,20299,882,2122,316,7015,289,627,4894,331,1041,634,7848,1465,28374,18845,29889,28079,270,29915,24430,29892,818,301,29915,524,14508,316,425,8475,29892,274,29915,342,818,2970,1465,425,260,1387,29889,2661,29899,346,712,966,3581,567,953,4089,15817,575,409,24590,296,1671,872,19513,634,5256,895,6267,8825,316,4084,568,29973,438,29884,707,29899,346,439,29915,585,6761,533,29892,980,7175,29888,1908,8121,261,966,270,1295,29892,707,875,29948,6267,904,4428,291,427,6651,1577,1174,13495,29892,432,29915,1794,28643,454,17889,316,425,12
