{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T12:57:06.192092156Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does an adequate job of presenting their argument and using evidence to support it, but there are some areas where they could improve.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more specific examples of how the European Union has contributed to improving human rights in the member states. While they mention the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights, they do not provide any concrete examples of how these institutions have helped protect individuals' rights.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic of European integration and its impact on human rights. While they mention that the European Union is a \"grand pays du monde\", they do not explain why this is significant or how it has affected human rights in the member states.\n\nLastly, the speaker could have been more clear and concise in their argumentation. At times, their speech feels disjointed and unclear, with multiple tangents and digressions that detract from the main point.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates some knowledge and passion for the topic, there are areas where they could improve to make their argument more persuasive and clear.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,1738,853,20443,425,8825,1738,405,681,9364,787,443,4092,29892,373,8556,1029,787,29892,454,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,634,301,29915,562,14316,17611,264,316,734,8182,533,316,301,29915,21708,1750,17512,15532,7814,4441,1169,29892,7814,4303,1064,743,29892,6299,1166,2122,29889,1459,17488,29892,425,4303,19113,270,29915,4548,1414,29892,7814,4441,1169,29892,1766,423,6609,29892,3632,29438,950,267,29892,966,4441,1169,270,29915,279,374,412,20924,631,29889,951,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,634,301,29915,562,14316,17611,264,316,734,8182,533,316,301,29915,21708,29892,17737,434,782,9744,29892,626,15817,9386,425,24228,18934,316,409,337,417,381,818,805,2487,296,301,29915,21708,29889,7298,680,29885,358,29892,980,263,5246,301,29915,932,1481,29892,3503,301,29915,6574,627,302,29915,342,18413,1465,1597,25642,4771,29889,317,4227,449,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,1893,314,1117,279,802,634,301,29915,279,307,5295,29889,5462,409,2453,329,7890,1190,301,29915,279,307,5295,29973,315,29915,342,454,2298,4595,9744,868,9122,1750,263,17103,29948,2298,316,425,2730,26665,316,301,29915,1285,262,424,29889,315,29915,342,1597,7242,4584,2428,772,790,10646,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,8463,4584,2852,271,3817,2488,29889,315,29915,342,282,449,457,29892,1437,1129,277,29892,29871,29906,29900,6063,29889,478,681,282,6223,29920,7890,25497,276,818,425,1139,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,279,307,5295,707,443,4092,29889,2661,29899,346,712,409,454,9744,17611,264,29973,315,29915,342,4226,29892,1354,7890,25497,26477,1661,29889,365,29915,496,482,332,263,6701,302,29915,279,374,412,2331,818,409,1539,2484,270,29915,5753,536,1190,5278,1139,29889,365,29915,465,663,1616,4279,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,279,307,5295,707,443,14738,868,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,3503,274,29915,342,443,14738,9577,23662,29889,5202,276,301,29915,2696,5218,29892,712,301,29915,279,307,5295,707,443,17949,868,5419,316,13900,712,301,29915,5753,434,545,12852,29892,4875,6303,427,12573,2535,270,29915,14559,9744,18490,316,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29889,435,29915,1794,2123,29890,492,29948,782,9484,296,29889,8748,5695,29892,301,29915,273,5753,29948,4486,335,944,29892,1597,8691,316,18249,818,304,29875,29892,316,301,29915,562,5606,358,29889,8396,29892,432,29915,1794,2123,29890,492,29948,270,29915,14559,17124,6609,29889,8748,12866,29892,316,734,2970,301,29915,6574,627,270,29915,348,13547,634,11062,1190,454,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,301,29915,5753,434,545,17611,264,29892,26814,17950,316,301,29915,21708,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,712,301,29915,932,8109,749,316,301,29915,279,307,5295,29892,782,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,263,1034,29892,8556,6309,29892,1190,5278,18765,362,29892,707,5278,12666,29889,6803,2062,9030,29892,1444,14954,1173,818,1601,509,261,712,14984,966,5302,724,29878,30000,794,868,1283,1249,712,301,29915,2696,276,21423,868,27923,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,263,1034,634,443,610,29888,1249,29889,8748,712,301,29915,279,307,5295,263,443,2134,29888,1249,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,766,1601,373,371,332,712,316,734,2970,301,29915,2467,427,4327,29948,29892,4875,263,454,27923,316,301,29915,15654,634,301,29915,5753,536,29889,365,29915,18288,712,274,29915,342,18916,29892,425,4224,2459,316,301,29915,279,307,5295,263,4370,1597,29835,316,1841,4068,1671,301,29915,29877,3200,29948,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,263,1034,818,443,6788,316,17950,818,301,29915,21708,29889,11948,29892,707,29899,346,712,5278,1841,4068,263,330,355,5606,2298,316,6079,712,316,4439,29973,315,29915,342,269,30095,29878,712,301,29915,279,307,5295,16933,11387,443,8348,352,2131,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,279,307,5295,1750,707,3300,861,29889,951,27923,316,301,29915,15654,707,425,1034,29211,316,29871,29941,316,301,29915,21708,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,385,19967,339,403,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,322,773,10757,304,2304,372,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,310,920,278,7824,7761,756,26869,304,4857,17
