{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T18:50:42.47345624Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a persuasive message. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. This suggests that they have a good understanding of how to structure an argument and present it in a logical and coherent manner.\n2. The speaker uses persuasive language and rhetorical devices, such as repetition (e.g., \"Huitia! Huitia!\"), metaphors (\"le cerveau est un horloge biologique\"), and emotional appeals (\"C'est tel qui contrôle notre cycle sommeil...\"). These devices help to make the argument more compelling and convincing.\n3. The speaker provides some evidence to support their claims, such as the correlation between the body's natural circadian rhythm and the occurrence of infectious diseases. This suggests that they have done some research and are able to provide some basis for their argument.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speaker could improve:\n\n1. The speaker sometimes uses overly complex language, which can make it difficult for the audience to follow their train of thought. For example, the sentence \"Je choisis une dizaine de personnes voluntaires scènes. Ça peut être nouveau. Je laisse y comme leur embre toute l'année.\" is quite hard to understand.\n2. The speaker does not provide a clear and convincing explanation for how their research on the body's natural rhythm could lead to a cure for infectious diseases. While they mention that scientists could use their findings to create medicines that target the gènes au loge, they do not provide any specific examples or explain how this would work.\n3. The speaker sometimes uses an overly simplistic view of the body's biological processes, which can make their argument seem less convincing. For example, when they say \"Le dit, je sais. C'est pour la bonne cause, va vrai?\", it seems like a superficial justification for their research and does not fully address the complexity of the issue.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more persuasive and convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,379,3121,423,1738,379,3121,423,1738,9070,1738,315,29915,342,316,867,26039,818,286,29915,29874,11878,5291,29948,1738,1551,263,9411,766,424,443,8694,29889,16579,802,19951,29892,425,867,11540,11943,1173,9291,29915,30001,29871,29947,14746,316,18554,427,3444,29889,6340,8164,6701,7848,5758,295,1671,966,18554,634,2298,13855,631,29889,478,681,29871,22730,10814,20737,9667,743,2298,439,7768,301,29915,29948,5935,2249,347,316,330,374,4798,452,9378,993,712,13180,301,29915,29923,369,29889,838,943,712,454,24424,3911,707,16474,12563,301,29915,18704,1577,478,681,302,29915,22730,2331,966,480,3246,29889,2664,9638,361,3783,409,926,296,5278,1139,8997,316,25226,8595,29889,8748,19601,5695,29892,4377,29920,29899,23088,712,270,29915,348,14857,5147,345,585,980,343,263,1597,4029,417,479,4768,20015,29889,315,29915,342,13547,1750,4313,12161,24145,11412,1047,1004,309,29892,321,29882,325,29889,11948,454,2298,4100,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,1808,263,680,24145,14913,818,3999,1437,11363,1041,3700,782,9200,915,29889,405,681,274,29915,342,301,29915,26029,2131,818,337,6102,381,301,29915,19809,27282,610,301,29915,2015,417,479,4768,20015,29892,818,301,29915,29874,680,316,10741,330,22702,818,7006,966,330,22702,4029,1188,267,29889,315,29915,342,330,22702,4497,2017,13180,425,21824,1318,29889,1720,27666,553,410,6772,1475,1750,27227,895,5646,24145,21423,5198,348,9407,634,5994,895,24145,15927,3700,782,9200,915,29889,349,5818,425,26245,29892,11797,269,29915,29948,13048,872,285,10877,11412,29889,838,943,2535,1601,25740,29892,427,7019,277,277,29889,6101,301,29915,309,343,263,443,11412,8955,631,1465,454,18165,17239,316,7814,3038,2540,5198,5441,7147,29892,274,29915,342,1950,439,29915,309,343,263,443,2407,316,301,29915,18704,29889,13861,5646,29892,425,5061,276,6282,484,26269,316,454,6701,29892,3503,5695,26269,868,14419,309,29889,2581,14954,1173,12866,818,7199,9030,29892,1354,980,19947,443,619,264,2637,24145,4029,417,479,4768,20015,29892,4875,707,4439,328,347,3041,522,347,1509,1750,10503,7081,553,2258,30019,787,7015,4207,1240,5908,4191,425,330,374,4798,29889,6803,844,22687,29892,1444,3060,15773,1597,270,6619,457,316,18554,24792,7147,885,22702,29889,29871,30219,29874,8164,7848,13164,29889,2581,425,5582,343,4191,6267,953,1030,12563,301,29915,18704,29889,315,29915,342,818,10489,482,29892,1444,872,275,29889,315,29915,342,1671,425,289,7293,4556,29892,2947,325,17016,29973,2581,4443,5646,2257,1750,564,9318,1465,7015,18554,782,9587,316,301,29915,18704,29889,10043,966,521,15806,868,330,1908,29889,951,6309,29892,1444,29758,443,7006,18916,29892,443,521,10312,355,270,29915,27419,29889,10050,29889,15113,260,9373,29892,454,6309,5153,9030,1671,425,1020,2496,1597,297,20309,8230,3712,1908,29889,2581,6267,544,5903,542,347,868,4771,9411,966,17478,29889,435,29915,1144,650,966,3038,2540,5198,5441,7147,16962,375,1465,454,13625,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,301,29915,1794,3209,344,29889,2581,302,29915,17833,347,966,330,22702,1671,1480,29872,634,1444,14111,6267,20299,882,29889,751,1379,872,14125,29871,4277,301,29915,524,277,29973,751,1379,872,14125,5278,1178,1318,29973,365,29915,272,18108,316,301,29915,12861,22819,333,316,13547,2535,425,282,538,654,316,13547,2123,13547,4439,328,347,3041,522,347,1509,29889,1174,26379,29892,439,29915,1808,301,423,277,818,260,29915,2719,2637,6267,5039,2131,634,966,4439,328,583,3041,522,347,6394,1750,623,2518,19047,316,2258,15529,7015,4207,1240,5908,29889,838,11867,29899,29891,29892,1444,26099,316,4883,25902,29889,435,29915,9983,1908,712,966,9638,361,3783,1671,24416,10135,374,7808,553,10283,293,20060,805,4582,361,3783,1750,325,609,269,29915,29891,289,1358,966,19462,316,2258,13876,344,553,330,22702,782,1480,29872,29889,1459,2257,289,423,275,29892,11797,1671,24416,3677,1654,546,634,7890,452,7890,7252,29920,29892,707,364,2219,17851,29892,966,4439,328,583,3041,522,347,6394,7015,4207,1240,5908,29889,1105,4099,29920,373,14403,2249,2488,29889,379,2335,29884,29991,379,2335,29884,29991,2178,261,14954,970,29889,4231,6311,29892,274,29915,342,316,867,347,29886,712,1444,592,1020,28123,8997,553,3031,13116,29889,4111,29892,29871,4277,409,21714,2331,270,29915,314,328,2353,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,2
