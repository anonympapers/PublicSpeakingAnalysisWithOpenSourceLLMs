The speaker does an excellent job of using rhetorical devices and emotional appeals to make their point about the importance of documenting the history of healthcare in Reunion.\n\nThe speaker uses vivid imagery and storytelling to engage the audience, drawing them into the narrative and making the topic more relatable and interesting. They also use repetition and emphasis to drive home key points and make sure the audience remembers them. The speaker's use of rhetorical questions is also effective in encouraging the audience to think critically about the topic and consider different perspectives.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the speaker could improve to make their message even more persuasive. For example, the speaker could have provided more specific examples or data to support their claims about the importance of documenting the history of healthcare in Reunion. Additionally, the speaker could have built more suspense or tension in their narrative to keep the audience engaged and interested throughout.\n\nOverall, the speaker does a great job of crafting a convincing message that is both informative and engaging.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,980,343,263,19449,1750,7175,2218,296,425,286,7342,29877,2123,10440,19449,1750,7175,2218,296,425,6003,381,4191,5278,19489,30000,1030,10395,420,6600,655,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,452,544,2487,12737,264,29892,3503,1444,16623,21907,12784,316,6628,1314,29889,4731,7081,29892,1444,592,17775,1759,1465,454,8714,29889,6101,1444,7890,766,274,29915,14386,782,885,711,316,12534,538,29892,2257,21714,4439,29887,457,29892,26520,293,309,457,2123,10440,3814,316,282,1064,262,2075,2131,29892,7890,316,13325,7890,2970,3503,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,1808,8556,1153,535,371,29889,11948,373,4313,5340,29892,1444,7890,610,11818,553,22956,583,316,1601,29875,29899,29873,473,457,29892,316,480,8107,29899,29887,2124,5340,29892,29871,4277,7890,610,280,8164,29899,5474,443,7006,2298,29889,1459,2460,7890,29892,4883,270,1280,409,29627,29892,8164,29899,5474,712,3058,267,4625,20737,27282,1055,9948,29889,8748,25763,7890,29892,4473,8894,29892,6079,29892,7890,8992,29920,2304,29948,29889,390,932,6146,29920,29899,23088,1465,5278,269,3498,270,29915,562,3222,882,29892,553,14884,29892,553,25974,1144,29892,553,269,1179,27965,1314,6282,316,7890,29892,5646,707,11266,16083,11728,29892,4313,30069,12898,634,966,289,10126,743,19445,427,1735,25595,358,427,3209,316,25698,5000,29889,11948,1190,6033,1647,29899,29903,1450,1100,766,424,427,564,9318,29892,1539,2484,782,9122,634,6003,381,782,9122,302,29915,29948,13048,2331,521,11214,267,2258,21873,29889,405,681,1047,4467,427,29871,29896,29929,29946,29953,29892,425,5027,13094,707,443,13202,7691,29892,3503,966,5855,316,6316,3435,7175,1113,2658,634,425,6434,9753,9407,707,7175,16770,1647,29889,853,289,10126,29948,1190,4832,29892,302,29915,27601,2331,301,29915,29282,270,29915,348,385,29889,29871,29953,29946,19778,274,29915,342,454,260,7293,634,7209,872,2432,25123,29892,634,325,276,1314,29899,16381,2841,5419,316,269,1179,27965,1314,1671,301,29915,24031,316,301,29915,26917,29889,8407,439,29915,1540,1437,695,3742,2131,29892,782,2757,553,29550,790,4110,13457,4285,29892,553,4439,328,583,427,4565,277,316,439,29915,309,21668,4963,942,904,3665,29875,7808,634,443,767,802,4100,316,6351,9139,316,20877,29948,29889,11948,364,465,545,29920,7006,818,7006,553,626,15817,272,800,29889,11948,427,29871,29896,29929,29946,29929,29892,29871,29946,29953,29892,29896,29929,29947,29900,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,1750,263,1874,29948,1577,1632,20032,818,1750,3440,1577,8748,6079,1671,25497,276,818,7015,5155,29892,260,1379,14954,454,419,344,553,8714,24635,29892,1444,286,29915,2108,331,275,1465,439,29915,1808,29889,2581,325,1759,818,425,26186,316,577,647,3794,18934,316,4224,5128,12416,1465,7594,29188,634,316,7594,26722,29892,2257,3435,626,15817,272,743,3999,2600,10964,26269,316,425,14177,344,29892,1055,9948,634,17887,427,3444,29889,2581,12033,1759,8648,270,29915,25378,425,26722,4555,29892,782,9587,316,301,29915,13624,29892,4625,29378,27478,966,13698,634,966,544,19669,1998,424,818,2504,283,7869,425,20877,29948,316,425,21428,634,316,301,29915,23578,424,29892,818,626,15817,9386,966,12286,13457,29038,634,966,5855,818,425,1055,9948,29889,1720,1702,13871,712,9184,452,269,29915,342,2331,5246,427,443,8694,29889,8748,6079,5278,4603,16067,5646,1487,4771,29889,1174,20744,29892,454,21423,316,20877,29948,712,8556,17043,790,787,9411,22572,29915,15669,818,425,337,13094,29892,818,3737,29899,29953,29900,16474,818,2257,16797,29948,634,818,872,286,1690,473,457,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,904,699,276,301,29915,13624,316,425,20877,29948,452,8164,409,9073,7209,904,699,276,301,29915,13624,553,1374,17764,948,1355,29889,1720,269,29915,23121,316,1539,2484,818,425,2011,1318,316,9411,553,1841,29883,1169,316,6316,1750,452,3435,1465,20480,348,1842,270,29915,1279,3145,29892,20480,348,20207,29889,8748,1671,339,7768,2331,9073,427,29835,712,454,27144,285,5793,8691,316,24145,286,2249,14119,6314,573,1577,10793,26722,553,9484,800,270,29915,13624,427,425,6299,749,1190,553,13349,29877,647,1179,12450,2016,6079,553,10042,1179,29889,12390,1374,17764,948,3794,4625,23484,1465,6267,20428,29892,373,409,1083,2249,272,424,6267,1437,1441,29892,6267,3060,861,29889,8748,6079,29892,4875,18332,818,8689,425,1841,546,29883,918,5
