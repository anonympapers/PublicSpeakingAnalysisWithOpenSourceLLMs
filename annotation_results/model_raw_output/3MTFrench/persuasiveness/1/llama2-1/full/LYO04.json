{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T09:23:32.424752531Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as metaphors (e.g., \"le monde magnifique qui nous entoure\") and repetition (e.g., \"Arthur et Monique\") to engage the audience and build a connection with them. However, there are some areas where the speech could be improved:\n\n1. Lack of clarity on the topic: While the speaker provides some interesting insights into the properties of polymers, it is not entirely clear how these apply to the topic of lighter aircraft. More explanation and context would be helpful in making the connection between the two.\n2. Vagueness on the solution proposed: The speaker proposes a \"rigide\" termes audure as a solution to reduce the impact of aircraft on the environment. However, it is not entirely clear how this would work or what specific benefits it would provide. More details and evidence would be helpful in supporting this proposal.\n3. Lack of emotional connection: While the speaker attempts to create an emotional connection with the audience by using words like \"intimit√©\" and \"amour,\" it is not entirely clear how these apply to the topic of aircraft design. A stronger emotional connection could be established through more personal anecdotes or stories related to the topic.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speech could be improved, the speaker demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and uses effective rhetorical devices to engage the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,26099,2793,270,29915,5474,29871,1654,19398,7890,29889,1174,4951,29892,1444,454,724,1794,10440,2298,316,1667,29879,29892,610,346,712,1261,475,29892,1444,452,610,275,427,11757,2925,29889,365,29915,29949,262,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,8556,1047,4467,316,2298,427,2298,10426,29889,405,681,24684,787,2923,25123,358,8556,27962,316,7015,22683,267,1045,30058,2167,11510,284,492,1912,29892,966,1029,1080,29889,11044,388,787,8532,439,29915,2719,8608,10978,2298,316,18554,634,316,1841,700,533,6267,10879,12471,17239,284,29889,997,1650,29892,425,10918,1908,29899,6772,29889,390,3451,4620,1318,23563,5541,1934,427,1223,631,610,553,1775,4894,2993,5541,3246,14924,316,966,7697,267,9291,29915,30001,29871,29945,29900,29995,2298,966,330,29889,1704,301,29915,9509,358,5882,316,7015,5541,3246,29892,274,29915,342,868,715,579,1387,29889,853,24324,261,29892,1597,24286,10329,28123,316,6062,29948,21337,2893,3783,29889,9353,1601,2280,29892,980,707,316,425,6635,2445,7661,553,1840,267,12990,332,455,1849,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,439,29915,309,1411,20752,610,1841,2467,20674,1387,18097,373,454,521,585,17615,634,1597,10098,3984,427,13618,29892,980,452,8164,2331,7848,1083,27224,1318,29889,2598,1840,267,12990,332,29892,443,3814,316,5796,415,545,633,7293,818,301,29915,28661,29889,951,760,269,29915,342,2281,332,29948,29892,980,263,1597,289,7293,16160,2131,14563,1387,634,8774,3068,1387,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,11498,707,13855,488,29889,1771,895,332,29892,285,790,545,29892,5796,415,545,29892,269,29915,284,535,29948,29889,11948,2331,316,7243,1387,29892,980,343,263,1601,1387,29889,2598,1387,263,5278,1597,14857,6635,2445,7661,316,24324,261,29892,443,1840,267,715,579,1387,29889,2598,1387,29892,6299,29892,707,316,6079,286,29915,29874,2540,5898,966,2258,1169,316,425,521,744,332,29889,12390,263,29899,29873,29899,283,29973,315,29915,342,10850,7342,4292,1387,634,904,4230,1387,29889,838,943,29892,16623,787,301,29915,6329,4325,9996,261,634,715,265,479,787,1465,6267,938,326,2131,29889,8407,5646,13222,29892,11498,707,1601,1387,7209,260,3906,6079,29889,1720,13618,21285,1597,1650,2730,1764,29892,7814,6299,1934,29892,17422,3200,26325,13805,29889,11948,18916,29892,432,29915,1639,29894,993,29889,2581,1601,371,425,5694,19113,316,6267,9892,802,25482,744,634,11498,1841,23121,29889,1720,2947,5443,261,7015,6062,29948,21337,29892,966,1597,3479,10890,316,2298,427,2298,325,568,29892,9291,29915,30001,4642,443,28710,427,7732,13391,29889,853,1840,267,12990,545,29892,12912,680,29892,19950,874,1821,29889,838,943,29892,2598,1387,452,409,2665,2298,818,872,2058,2637,966,13137,270,29915,442,1973,2123,3261,634,818,29188,1750,454,1841,23121,29889,8748,4875,2947,409,1539,2484,427,16380,280,634,9073,11179,1030,818,760,29889,8748,274,29915,342,610,5278,7019,862,362,712,2598,1387,263,270,29915,442,545,263,2304,29948,966,521,12332,29889,10050,29892,2331,904,29885,8194,20809,358,8774,3068,1387,29889,4546,29875,29892,5178,453,1908,427,8220,2637,24324,261,29892,1444,14954,1173,818,4313,30069,1358,301,29915,29948,4068,316,6267,263,794,545,21622,499,434,1509,29889,2581,1236,1314,29892,610,17488,29892,7697,276,2598,1387,2298,1098,381,1647,29889,1720,3911,1539,3018,13545,5697,1169,3184,10270,20674,3783,1750,325,609,6079,427,2174,533,11498,29889,6101,6079,29892,439,29915,309,2947,425,17161,261,2298,1472,27761,782,16573,316,3911,29889,8748,18729,2947,13787,2265,425,260,8284,553,409,9073,316,2598,1387,1465,425,3829,11498,29889,8396,29892,610,8474,29892,432,29915,29891,18948,484,29889,1720,343,263,11498,634,2598,1387,1750,409,8937,296,10440,1671,1597,298,6844,316,325,3246,344,316,1841,2467,29889,1174,5646,3209,29892,1671,2145,2853,818,4224,5128,12416,2257,9122,9119,22781,1750,8556,875,25664,29889,405,681,1029,787,3008,28230,316,286,3610,6916,270,29915,1639,7387,29889,5462,2257,12852,2637,24324,261,1465,553,1029,1080,2298,22109,914,2123,427,534,942,29889,8407,13911,333,819,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,1539,12451,943,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376
