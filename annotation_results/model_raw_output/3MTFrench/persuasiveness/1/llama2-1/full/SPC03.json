{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T20:10:08.232491707Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions to engage the audience and make them think about their own behaviors. For example, \"Et si le continue à se rite, il multiplie ses risques de maladies qui arrivent à se culer.\" This helps to create a sense of empathy and urgency among the listeners.\n2. The speaker provides specific examples and data to support their claims. For instance, \"Il a lieu et vu comme nous tous ici des compagnes de prévention, pour arrêter de fumée et pour bouger plus.\" This helps to build credibility and trust with the audience.\n3. The speaker's tone is confident and authoritative, which can be persuasive in itself. However, there are some moments where the tone feels a bit forced or overly enthusiastic, which could potentially detract from the overall impact of the speech.\n4. While the speaker does provide some personalized advice to the audience member, the application they propose is quite generic and doesn't feel tailored to the individual's specific needs and preferences. This could limit the persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nOverall, the speaker does a good job of presenting their argument in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where they could improve to make the speech more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,274,29915,342,5646,26269,316,7890,29892,286,17914,360,2603,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,316,285,398,1318,29892,1444,24108,454,7980,29892,634,9411,966,7431,2310,2708,592,3669,29882,1249,296,316,286,29915,292,29539,316,285,398,1318,29889,8748,1444,24108,454,7980,818,301,29915,16063,457,10098,316,2298,29892,980,269,29915,29891,3948,9061,29892,634,274,29915,342,15237,2331,6628,1314,7980,29889,8748,1354,454,6773,818,409,364,568,29892,980,2473,572,347,3999,5161,1912,316,4439,328,583,1750,564,374,794,818,409,274,8584,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,980,263,13003,634,18679,4191,8556,9411,29871,1654,553,752,4211,267,316,7175,7316,29892,1671,3948,30037,357,316,285,398,1318,634,1671,289,692,261,2298,29889,5791,25698,5000,302,29915,342,2331,443,767,802,316,17385,362,2123,316,24792,29948,29892,782,6761,533,29889,323,681,7015,7191,3435,6836,7744,2406,818,7814,29892,270,29915,7308,4279,316,6316,452,6836,2022,5711,261,29889,997,1650,1671,8356,7848,1597,2280,316,16317,296,29948,29892,4067,1318,818,553,5446,1691,316,20877,29948,4511,2406,4191,553,16703,1973,270,29915,11236,2131,29892,1671,8556,263,1241,818,1874,261,1411,519,358,7814,4760,8192,316,6316,29889,2598,18848,316,266,17449,302,29915,342,2331,20498,882,316,9484,261,5278,2280,270,29915,562,2388,4211,882,15001,5711,1318,868,5161,802,5881,29875,586,6151,1070,29892,3503,316,7175,862,261,12563,301,29915,262,14867,12425,29892,301,29915,264,5815,30058,17239,1480,1387,29892,1750,19172,336,3479,19313,7664,11689,316,13942,29877,2496,5278,2280,29889,8748,1671,712,5278,2280,12852,6366,815,29892,980,21668,439,29915,1808,2653,5582,27516,553,5178,2719,15001,5711,743,818,18402,20077,316,5161,802,5881,29875,586,6151,1070,29889,8748,1671,19397,16219,381,7015,20077,29879,316,5161,802,29892,432,29915,4422,895,553,21880,1721,375,270,29915,1540,22085,9061,1757,1318,610,301,29915,22653,5000,29892,782,16573,316,29871,29906,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,18554,29889,16932,4625,1841,1112,700,818,553,1120,542,602,1056,2658,29892,1190,6267,4464,316,6316,29892,6267,2852,271,316,20877,29948,29892,6267,22591,5264,6351,23497,29889,8748,818,8019,316,14984,7015,21880,29892,1444,325,1759,19397,15882,553,12694,1237,20077,29879,316,5161,802,634,6787,533,553,564,16105,316,4224,2459,29889,8748,9551,261,818,301,29915,29874,680,270,29915,348,419,2131,270,29915,735,546,1372,10283,293,2993,29892,443,19607,7744,29948,818,18402,20077,29889,8748,1354,373,6664,993,818,24145,18926,29892,373,427,872,277,270,29915,485,749,270,29915,29282,1190,3911,29889,1720,5246,286,29915,6574,562,261,610,8694,29889,1720,263,553,17898,30019,787,29892,980,707,782,521,30069,29885,482,29889,360,29915,19908,1487,20077,29892,301,29915,6214,2947,3911,9551,261,553,1824,4467,15001,5711,743,1671,22964,2853,7015,2114,11620,316,5161,802,878,28677,29889,8748,1465,443,7017,8714,29892,980,2947,29892,610,17488,29892,9073,443,18766,270,29915,348,17478,7209,4434,562,29892,3503,8648,22964,2853,872,1136,3011,362,316,3038,267,29892,427,1841,700,275,424,7015,13900,21136,1379,29892,439,29915,442,276,782,269,9457,29889,8748,427,4951,29892,301,29915,29884,9551,261,553,7019,2925,270,29915,11236,2131,15001,5711,743,818,11387,316,3581,567,29889,8748,425,2186,2131,316,5278,2280,16933,439,29915,1808,12852,878,352,519,1465,454,8714,29889,8748,7847,29892,29378,2853,634,9551,261,553,1824,4467,634,553,5178,2719,427,18165,316,301,29915,29948,4068,868,20077,634,553,7175,8191,316,18402,20077,29889,8748,782,285,764,427,4951,29892,592,1190,1261,475,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,316,285,4680,29889,8748,1444,24108,454,7980,316,3516,25404,286,17914,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,432,29915,1794,3948,30037,6772,316,285,4680,634,1444,16623,868,7980,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,963,1348,1048,1009,1914,4010,18930,29889,1152,1342,29892,376,29923,29873,1354,454,6773,818,409,364,568,29892,980,2473,572,347,3999,5161,1912,316,4439,328,583,1750,564,374,794,818,409,274,8584,1213,91
