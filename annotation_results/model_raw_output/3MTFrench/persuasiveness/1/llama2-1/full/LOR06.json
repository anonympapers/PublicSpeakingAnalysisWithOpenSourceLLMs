{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T18:17:53.932410988Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using a clear and structured argument, presenting evidence and data to support their claims, and addressing potential counterarguments.\n\nThe speaker begins by acknowledging the jury's concerns about the client's influence on citizens and applications, but then argues that persuasion can also be used for good causes. They present three sites (WWF, Greenpeace, Humanité, biodiversité) as examples of how persuasion can be used to promote positive behaviors and attitudes towards the environment.\n\nThe second stage of the argument is more convincing, as the speaker presents evidence from 30 participants who explored the WWF site. By using a nain étracleur (a device that tracks the participant's gaze) and a questionnaire to measure attitudes and intentions towards WWF, the speaker shows that exposure to persuasive elements can lead to changes in attention and attitude.\n\nHowever, the speech could be even more persuasive if the speaker provided more concrete examples of how the client's influence has led to positive environmental outcomes. Additionally, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments more directly, such as concerns about privacy and data security when using persuasion techniques on a large scale.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a well-structured and convincing argument that persuasion can be used for good causes, but could benefit from additional evidence and addressing of potential counterarguments to further enhance their persuasiveness.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,18080,29892,4473,8894,966,11099,743,29892,1444,592,16391,19398,7890,22572,29915,15669,1671,11482,9030,425,4556,316,611,3132,29872,29892,425,20408,7002,29889,6340,707,26142,1318,270,29915,13453,3837,2265,966,20299,4110,427,1354,29899,9894,1934,29892,1465,553,274,2049,29891,575,634,553,8324,29889,478,681,1437,5464,29883,1318,872,29845,1465,1597,1773,4279,316,11549,277,10270,7825,1512,1314,29889,2581,7199,1975,325,359,274,5270,267,29889,10050,992,347,270,29915,348,2643,29892,443,7284,270,29915,328,3640,29884,427,297,6578,1893,29889,11948,425,20408,7002,288,29872,4090,276,5695,1671,425,289,7293,4556,29889,435,29915,932,1808,818,425,2594,276,7629,1318,11387,5882,29892,1750,7890,1283,374,336,818,966,758,29884,1960,18806,13876,868,1437,29894,283,882,29892,316,611,3132,29872,782,2669,316,301,29915,21813,17239,29889,26475,19882,29892,274,29915,342,454,29140,782,13295,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,29889,461,443,274,2049,11771,8164,13417,533,553,4348,375,818,1874,261,6267,20299,882,634,2298,7175,3476,15471,553,20299,4110,7853,1849,818,301,29915,21813,17239,1577,6803,25497,276,818,5278,1139,29892,286,29915,1131,342,29899,346,270,29915,4582,1132,267,427,7732,2852,11603,29889,28720,904,941,412,29892,432,29915,1794,7019,1464,5483,7732,11840,29892,399,29686,29892,7646,412,815,29892,12968,2131,29892,289,2660,1536,2131,29889,365,29915,3318,361,707,316,17161,261,454,3268,782,2298,26379,3104,296,709,270,29915,13453,29884,2063,29889,6803,409,9073,29892,29871,29945,29892,29945,289,8226,286,29915,609,1757,29948,553,1663,412,1953,818,301,29915,29874,680,316,867,275,316,3994,5908,639,6102,10770,10270,6787,3246,610,553,2902,1372,29889,9353,5278,364,573,29892,7890,5663,8885,6096,610,17488,454,3994,1908,270,29915,1131,381,427,269,2249,8194,9139,29892,1750,409,11482,2344,610,454,5246,316,1437,695,264,4630,1597,904,29885,8194,521,747,283,1671,7890,5528,1524,818,946,381,29889,1174,21751,424,966,6896,19718,399,29686,29892,274,29915,342,818,1147,2872,7848,454,3268,782,2298,26379,3104,296,709,270,29915,13453,29884,2063,29892,2257,1750,8556,13417,277,818,425,26617,904,941,412,29889,6101,399,29686,640,993,553,7877,29948,1860,20408,294,10270,29892,21668,29899,309,10440,343,544,30037,357,8570,1577,6803,18729,29892,29871,29941,29900,27138,4625,3902,272,29948,399,29686,29889,349,5818,2257,8714,29892,925,29872,2181,434,316,6267,4880,29892,818,301,29915,29874,680,270,29915,348,302,475,2852,14090,332,29892,443,21423,11039,29948,1465,6267,4538,7289,1750,592,14924,316,10252,276,6267,4880,13180,6267,3902,12418,29889,897,5278,2258,15529,29892,1444,872,275,7175,3476,15471,2257,1750,263,4370,5820,29948,29892,2123,1661,29892,2257,1750,8556,13417,277,818,425,26617,904,941,412,29892,553,7877,29948,1860,20408,294,10270,1098,381,296,24145,8570,29892,3503,707,29899,346,439,29915,2719,4625,966,2258,1169,831,1285,29948,1577,6803,454,4048,6390,29892,1444,29188,966,1098,20816,8288,712,966,7609,1080,20299,882,2122,29892,4191,454,5246,316,9073,443,1016,818,399,29686,29889,7747,1139,15421,263,10259,492,4370,1597,8861,10098,29892,10042,425,1998,568,868,3268,634,1597,26617,10098,7907,29892,29871,4277,592,14924,316,1040,1008,1354,980,343,263,11878,2779,19882,553,1874,4110,270,29915,1131,2509,29892,2123,270,29915,1131,4279,29892,3503,2298,7175,3476,15471,316,8689,454,619,264,29892,553,7877,29948,1860,5820,2406,1750,4625,2653,13417,533,7015,1874,4110,29889,478,681,301,29915,1351,29920,7199,275,29892,18080,11946,8894,966,435,545,1372,29892,425,20408,7002,8164,24304,1358,8441,29892,1487,288,895,29892,3503,2637,316,289,24729,1667,29879,29892,4875,8164,7890,13417,533,782,26713,316,7890,29899,18202,29889,435,29915,9983,1908,712,7890,8992,29920,4880,29948,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,25554,29879,263,17953,3277,2643,491,773,263,2821,322,2281,2955,2980,29892,2198,292,10757,322,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,322,3211,292,7037,6795,25699,29889,13,13,1576,25657,16410,491,24084,3460,278,432,2857,29915,29879,21838,1048,278,3132,29915,29879,9949,373,18363,322,8324,29892,541,769,1852,
