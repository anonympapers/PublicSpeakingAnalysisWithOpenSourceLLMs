{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T13:19:06.162720074Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker provides some convincing arguments and reasoning to support their claim about the negative impact of the economy on education, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker highlights the issue of the Australian and French economies being signed in agreement, which results in the production of submarines without proper employment opportunities for years. This is a persuasive point as it shows the negative consequences of economic agreements on the job market. However, the speaker could have provided more context and evidence to support their claim. For example, they could have mentioned specific statistics or studies that demonstrate the impact of these agreements on employment rates in the two countries.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could have provided more nuanced reasoning when discussing the impact of the economy on education. While they acknowledge that there is a reduction in GDP, they do not provide any evidence to support this claim or explain how it relates to the education system. Providing more details and examples would have made their argument more convincing and rigorous.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some persuasive arguments, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,553,1437,1182,275,29892,443,12111,1564,993,966,904,700,29883,532,2658,29889,1174,16132,29892,5278,904,700,29883,532,2658,1863,296,29892,1444,534,8885,1794,425,11896,2637,966,23837,347,5264,267,634,966,904,700,29883,3780,267,29889,853,1775,262,882,1671,339,7768,454,4599,347,5264,29892,980,343,263,818,19601,29892,6303,1804,29948,427,15017,2637,301,29915,22537,347,634,966,3444,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,425,18187,362,316,9411,5898,29899,29885,2749,424,1750,1283,276,2665,296,7209,7930,417,347,1190,553,8595,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,4029,11710,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,1750,409,21714,29973,1720,286,29915,29874,6309,439,29915,309,343,263,1597,23837,347,1750,27435,2947,1671,1487,553,7930,371,29899,12974,267,5264,267,29892,1750,707,14344,29899,27048,27219,533,1249,1465,29871,29946,29900,29995,818,443,1841,700,428,316,402,2736,29889,9353,454,27666,10996,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,818,301,29915,18704,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,8128,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,1048,278,8178,10879,310,278,26504,373,9793,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,12141,29879,278,2228,310,278,9870,322,5176,7766,583,1641,8794,297,17327,29892,607,2582,297,278,5802,310,1014,3034,1475,1728,1571,5703,358,28602,1907,363,2440,29889,910,338,263,20408,294,573,1298,408,372,3697,278,8178,27721,310,17407,8571,4110,373,278,4982,9999,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,5276,2702,13964,470,11898,393,22222,278,10879,310,1438,8571,4110,373,5703,358,19257,297,278,1023,10916,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,4948,8362,24481,746,5353,292,278,10879,310,278,26504,373,9793,29889,5806,896,18145,5485,393,727,338,263,20376,297,402,11191,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,10757,304,2304,445,5995,470,5649,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,9793,1788,29889,9133,4821,901,4902,322,6455,723,505,1754,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,322,12912,20657,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,20408,294,573,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,10757,29889],"total_duration":52789249218,"load_duration":154852,"prompt_eval_count":197,"prompt_eval_duration":17770482000,"eval_count":279,"eval_duration":35018161000}
