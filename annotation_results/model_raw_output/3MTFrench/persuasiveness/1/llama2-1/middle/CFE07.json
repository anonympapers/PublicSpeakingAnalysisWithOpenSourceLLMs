The speaker presents their argument in a logical and structured manner, using evidence and examples to support their claims. However, there are some areas where the speaker could improve to make their message even more convincing:\n\n1. Clarity: At times, the speaker's arguments can be confusing or difficult to follow due to the complexity of the language used. Simplifying the language and providing clearer explanations would help to make the message more accessible to the audience.\n2. Emotional Appeal: While the speaker provides some emotive language, such as \"la méthode que j'ai s'évappiqué en science de l'édication\" (the method I have developed in education), they could benefit from using more emotional language to engage the audience and make their message more compelling.\n3. Evidence: While the speaker provides some evidence for their claims, they could benefit from providing more extensive research or studies to support their argument. This would help to build credibility and convince the audience of the effectiveness of their approach.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a well-structured argument, there are areas where they could improve to make their message even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,365,29915,29948,10936,1775,824,1808,452,9378,277,2331,1671,330,290,1050,3999,12694,2063,29892,3503,712,6299,966,23930,647,1934,301,29915,1175,2905,29948,2535,325,359,21038,29889,2598,18848,269,29915,1144,9695,1465,1597,2134,1173,6299,1318,1190,966,21880,3107,3794,29892,966,301,647,1934,8162,634,868,5777,861,29889,997,544,15819,2362,1318,1190,966,21880,2504,5326,302,29915,342,2331,316,325,30037,793,634,7890,427,8992,29920,875,355,29884,610,1358,29889,997,1539,2484,29899,29891,8556,3667,895,8997,29871,29946,29900,6063,29889,2664,25974,1144,10042,316,9551,261,443,1020,17334,29889,1720,409,2362,344,1190,553,21880,5713,519,1671,659,1241,1487,5189,29948,29889,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,5278,8774,386,356,712,432,29915,1794,269,29915,5903,932,8105,29948,427,10466,316,301,29915,2487,293,362,29889,435,29915,1794,17134,443,714,309,17655,5705,749,2535,301,29915,4582,1377,332,8774,386,397,20015,29892,13164,634,429,2231,424,29889,751,392,1444,610,280,270,29915,1300,375,29892,452,2331,1597,1067,29948,2614,433,895,2123,443,10733,30106,566,625,29889,315,29915,342,443,10754,282,2487,13247,1387,1750,1518,9854,3440,29231,5495,425,7199,29948,29882,2673,634,301,29915,812,12418,818,8019,270,29915,10336,316,301,29915,26283,1535,316,5739,267,29889,1551,872,277,712,373,1153,535,371,634,1597,25732,663,29709,1750,7853,895,301,29915,279,1431,347,316,2257,784,1908,29889,315,29915,342,1671,18729,712,1465,611,266,17449,29892,1444,2453,1314,904,791,2853,966,1801,1691,316,2257,10754,1190,966,623,7771,790,1179,634,966,7877,30000,1960,29889,7747,10754,707,1597,904,506,815,29892,707,29899,346,439,29915,309,8164,29973,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,16667,322,2281,2955,8214,29892,773,10757,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,1584,901,17953,3277,29901,13,13,29896,29889,15183,537,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,508,367,16051,470,5189,304,1101,2861,304,278,13644,310,278,4086,1304,29889,3439,572,9215,278,4086,322,13138,26135,7309,800,723,1371,304,1207,278,2643,901,15579,304,278,20026,29889,13,29906,29889,2812,327,1848,2401,29872,284,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,23023,573,4086,29892,1316,408,376,433,8774,386,356,712,432,29915,1794,269,29915,5903,932,8105,29948,427,10466,316,301,29915,2487,293,362,29908,313,1552,1158,306,505,8906,297,9793,511,896,1033,14169,515,773,901,23023,1848,4086,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,1009,2643,901,752,7807,29889,13,29941,29889,7298,5084,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,10757,363,1009,16726,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,20607,5925,470,11898,304,2304,1009,2980,29889,910,723,1371,304,2048,6625,4127,322,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,2779,20193,310,1009,2948,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":63472378060,"load_duration":187358,"prompt_eval_count":337,"prompt_eval_duration":28297400000,"eval_count":286,"eval_duration":35174338000}
