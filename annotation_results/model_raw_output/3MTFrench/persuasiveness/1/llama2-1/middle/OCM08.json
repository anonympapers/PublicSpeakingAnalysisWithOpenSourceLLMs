{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T02:11:13.011710715Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents a well-structured argument and uses logical reasoning to make their case for why the tactics they are proposing will be effective in facilitating the implantation of businesses on the African continent and fostering their growth and competitiveness.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speech could be improved to be even more persuasive:\n\n1. Emotional appeal: While the speaker provides logical reasoning and evidence to support their argument, they could benefit from adding a personal touch or emotional appeal to make the message more relatable and engaging for the audience.\n2. Specific examples: The speaker could provide more specific examples of how the tactics they are proposing have been successful in other contexts or with other businesses, to further build credibility and persuasiveness.\n3. Call to action: The speech could benefit from a clear call to action at the end, urging the audience to take specific steps to support the proposed tactics or to get involved in the discussion.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a strong argument, there are opportunities to make the message even more persuasive and compelling for the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,343,263,325,336,2073,316,439,7768,409,1539,2484,427,784,1908,29889,1704,29892,301,29915,627,29872,270,29915,348,1444,7890,610,280,29892,302,29915,342,443,20744,5541,29948,712,316,29871,29929,29871,29906,29900,29906,29900,7456,29889,29871,29929,29871,29906,29900,29906,29900,5879,277,3012,1387,1671,6367,533,634,2894,11728,301,29915,11236,2131,553,5374,28141,12128,270,29915,348,29871,29906,29892,29946,29906,29900,634,443,3300,861,16530,475,29889,1105,277,29892,29871,29906,29892,29955,29955,29906,14746,316,1136,3011,14075,29892,10890,9667,275,29892,2298,316,29871,29906,29945,29995,316,425,4665,3001,316,301,29915,3470,522,29872,383,747,344,29899,21972,819,29889,319,16474,29892,286,29915,342,29899,29881,550,316,4883,274,13805,29892,270,29915,348,4883,410,27499,316,23520,29892,432,29915,1794,1597,1139,29889,438,1481,29892,432,29915,1794,286,29915,524,1064,404,29948,1671,4048,6390,634,7199,9030,1354,2257,28476,29872,260,1808,439,29915,309,409,16474,707,443,29188,316,16089,1524,301,29915,13699,424,362,316,325,359,23440,4637,1190,454,25523,263,1341,293,475,634,427,6701,11172,7853,7608,6267,8182,9948,8288,712,6267,25732,24858,29892,425,18551,23497,20110,29889,435,29915,1794,11878,1601,26427,29889,6101,2257,28476,29872,260,1808,439,29915,309,409,3516,25404,29892,707,443,29188,316,325,359,17459,800,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,322,3913,16667,24481,304,1207,1009,1206,363,2020,278,28476,1199,896,526,9551,292,674,367,11828,297,16089,277,1218,278,13374,424,362,310,5381,267,373,278,11715,25523,322,9926,3241,1009,14321,322,5100,277,20193,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,304,367,1584,901,20408,294,573,29901,13,13,29896,29889,2812,327,1848,25530,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,16667,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,896,1033,14169,515,4417,263,7333,6023,470,23023,1848,25530,304,1207,278,2643,901,1104,17219,322,3033,6751,363,278,20026,29889,13,29906,29889,21220,6455,29901,450,25657,1033,3867,901,2702,6455,310,920,278,28476,1199,896,526,9551,292,505,1063,9150,297,916,3030,29879,470,411,916,5381,267,29892,304,4340,2048,6625,4127,322,20408,294,20193,29889,13,29941,29889,8251,304,3158,29901,450,12032,1033,14169,515,263,2821,1246,304,3158,472,278,1095,29892,5065,3460,278,20026,304,2125,2702,6576,304,2304,278,7972,28476,1199,470,304,679,9701,297,278,10679,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,4549,2980,29892,727,526,28602,1907,304,1207,278,2643,1584,901,20408,294,573,322,752,7807,363,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":59606186333,"load_duration":147309,"prompt_eval_count":267,"prompt_eval_duration":24167909000,"eval_count":276,"eval_duration":35437682000}
