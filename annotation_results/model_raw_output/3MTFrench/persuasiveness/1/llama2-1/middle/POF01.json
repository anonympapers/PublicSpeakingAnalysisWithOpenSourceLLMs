{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T15:19:58.206521947Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker does present some valid points about the importance of learning the language of contextualization and how it can benefit children in their academic and personal development. However, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or studies to support their claims, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, the speaker's language is sometimes vague or unclear, which can make it challenging for listeners to fully understand their message. For example, the phrase \"construction du langage\" could be more specific and defined, especially for an audience that may not be familiar with the term.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker acknowledges the importance of considering social and cultural factors in language learning, they do not provide any concrete examples or strategies for how parents can support their children in this process. This lack of detail makes it difficult to understand exactly how the speaker's approach can be applied in practice.\n\nOverall, while there are some valid points made in the speech, more attention could be given to providing evidence and specific strategies for how parents can support their children in learning the language of contextualization.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,425,715,1647,1465,454,282,30069,29889,1551,301,29915,6897,663,553,18554,634,553,5446,1691,29892,980,16374,3667,7608,443,6361,482,21975,439,29915,265,1426,950,7608,2298,7175,3476,29889,6803,339,7768,269,29915,524,1064,16136,782,6361,482,553,3030,950,4637,634,592,2970,29920,7890,29973,5701,7632,707,3686,296,11381,29892,1559,5646,782,1472,316,872,885,10170,2131,29892,443,7877,15792,2906,8356,904,1365,7808,553,451,1080,316,2298,427,2298,21975,439,29915,265,1426,950,7608,316,2298,427,2298,27086,277,29889,838,943,29892,3440,263,1241,7814,21038,818,454,6787,533,2257,6361,482,29973,349,4664,802,425,7632,868,6361,482,29892,4191,373,409,325,993,270,29915,28619,301,29915,265,509,29948,818,301,29915,29948,10936,1775,824,1808,29892,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,23520,707,1437,29881,566,423,275,29892,27188,609,29792,29892,301,29915,7342,482,3847,284,29889,997,26722,4555,966,11825,10259,4211,296,10713,21038,1465,425,7632,868,6361,482,260,29915,267,3030,950,11728,29889,11948,1671,21609,19844,5278,1203,361,29892,8556,2906,787,29585,16731,553,1828,14228,269,10183,1314,9257,26020,29892,8901,2993,1750,8121,296,443,17889,3686,296,709,29889,1551,707,5246,818,301,29915,29948,10936,29892,966,21038,316,1248,1475,275,437,27649,6787,533,454,6361,482,553,3030,950,275,743,427,25407,11076,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,6509,278,4086,310,3030,950,2133,322,920,372,508,14169,4344,297,1009,21567,322,7333,5849,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,11898,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,3732,372,5189,304,14707,278,2779,20193,310,1009,2948,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4086,338,6041,25160,470,20871,29892,607,508,1207,372,18066,292,363,11621,414,304,8072,2274,1009,2643,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,16549,376,3075,4080,868,6361,482,29908,1033,367,901,2702,322,3342,29892,7148,363,385,20026,393,1122,451,367,9985,411,278,1840,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,24084,2710,278,13500,310,13858,5264,322,16375,13879,297,4086,6509,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,6455,470,16650,583,363,920,11825,508,2304,1009,4344,297,445,1889,29889,910,10225,310,9493,3732,372,5189,304,2274,3721,920,278,25657,29915,29879,2948,508,367,7436,297,6944,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,2854,3291,1754,297,278,12032,29892,901,8570,1033,367,2183,304,13138,10757,322,2702,16650,583,363,920,11825,508,2304,1009,4344,297,6509,278,4086,310,3030,950,2133,29889],"total_duration":62512135191,"load_duration":155560,"prompt_eval_count":271,"prompt_eval_duration":25838246000,"eval_count":281,"eval_duration":36673254000}
