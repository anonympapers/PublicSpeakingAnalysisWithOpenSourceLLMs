{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T17:07:09.877326831Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents their idea in a clear and concise manner, using simple language and relatable examples to make their point. However, the reasoning behind their argument is not particularly rigorous or well-supported by evidence.\n\nThe speaker relies heavily on analogies and anecdotes to make their case, but does not provide any concrete data or research to back up their claims. While this can be an effective way to communicate a message, it does not demonstrate a thorough understanding of the topic or a rigorous approach to problem-solving.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's reliance on a single example (the \"Google Carp-Person\") may not be representative of the broader issue they are trying to address. A more convincing argument would involve a more comprehensive analysis of the problem and potential solutions, as well as a recognition of the limitations and potential drawbacks of any proposed approach.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's message is clear and easy to follow, it lacks the rigor and depth of analysis that would be necessary to convince a skeptical audience of the merits of their proposal.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1174,4951,289,999,29892,7890,8992,29920,7199,275,301,29915,333,1318,1577,7747,1134,316,18836,17239,29892,373,454,767,347,2298,9577,6079,451,277,819,29889,11948,21975,712,454,25698,5000,409,4280,28821,634,439,29915,309,21668,454,926,261,2123,3500,631,29892,29871,4277,409,3236,29892,373,452,872,277,2298,9201,439,7768,9073,29889,8748,18916,29892,13162,23855,882,9982,279,346,2386,993,29892,274,29915,342,282,2028,29899,29887,487,1750,6664,993,443,2245,286,2249,14119,1671,8556,263,1241,818,534,8885,301,29915,370,7293,553,8575,267,1671,6896,2736,276,454,25698,5000,29889,11948,373,452,8164,6094,1064,5711,261,553,9580,2487,1973,29892,966,7697,276,3345,19669,29892,7744,5056,29892,28273,267,29892,13052,5326,29892,10636,296,29892,10814,29892,7594,2245,8556,29892,29871,4277,18062,553,22420,14075,29889,11948,6079,22624,342,5606,29892,301,29915,20567,293,707,1597,27128,519,286,3610,397,347,15390,316,325,23469,410,29284,29889,11948,20957,787,427,2967,782,2967,316,301,29915,9564,3751,1004,2535,966,289,17718,1067,29948,3651,5855,634,5646,454,18062,29889,8741,29892,11172,712,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,270,29915,711,303,6436,19398,19601,29892,432,29915,485,749,29889,8882,265,29892,1444,1162,434,29889,20727,303,6436,818,26003,29892,1444,325,1759,594,15164,29889,20727,303,6436,818,29262,29892,1444,325,1759,818,26003,29889,8748,992,309,30001,29892,26814,7017,3093,3751,1004,1671,26814,5087,1704,29886,29899,7435,29889,315,29915,342,2331,6094,616,1577,8396,29892,634,16134,424,29892,3440,6079,623,29878,9030,2257,1134,316,883,5711,1004,1577,11479,29920,29899,23088,712,20737,1465,966,8595,29871,29955,29900,29892,1597,22577,16263,545,19964,2245,1318,4522,29877,29892,818,1601,509,261,712,301,29915,4548,1064,2073,362,18806,1821,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,712,425,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,322,1104,17219,6455,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,5742,1009,2980,338,451,10734,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29889,13,13,1576,25657,337,3687,20365,373,15690,583,322,385,687,29881,4769,304,1207,1009,1206,29892,541,947,451,3867,738,18387,848,470,5925,304,1250,701,1009,16726,29889,5806,445,508,367,385,11828,982,304,23120,263,2643,29892,372,947,451,22222,263,17826,8004,310,278,11261,470,263,12912,20657,2948,304,1108,29899,2929,1747,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,12536,749,373,263,2323,1342,313,1552,376,14207,1704,29886,29899,7435,1159,1122,451,367,21097,310,278,2545,1664,2228,896,526,1811,304,3211,29889,319,901,17953,3277,2980,723,25135,263,901,15171,6270,7418,310,278,1108,322,7037,6851,29892,408,1532,408,263,19679,310,278,27028,322,7037,4216,1627,29879,310,738,7972,2948,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,2821,322,4780,304,1101,29892,372,425,4684,278,12912,272,322,10809,310,7418,393,723,367,5181,304,7602,1239,263,18109,415,936,20026,310,278,2778,1169,310,1009,24963,29889],"total_duration":68733303900,"load_duration":150719,"prompt_eval_count":361,"prompt_eval_duration":34194068000,"eval_count":266,"eval_duration":34538608000}
