The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and hyperbole to emphasize their points, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that the police forces in France have no solution for processing Big Data is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the French police do not have a dedicated Big Data processing system, they do have access to various data analysis tools and technologies through their existing IT infrastructure. Moreover, the speaker's assertion that only 1500 public cameras are installed in Paris is also questionable, as there may be more than that number of surveillance cameras in the city.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker highlights the potential benefits of automating certain data processing tasks, they do not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. For instance, they assert that automation can help identify abandoned vehicles or generate alerts when certain groups of people are present in a given area. However, without further detail on how these systems work and what specific criteria they use to identify these groups, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of these features.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's delivery and rhetorical devices are effective in engaging the audience, there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make a stronger argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1465,454,18165,17239,25810,610,5444,17334,28273,267,29889,9353,2257,2432,9874,29892,980,7602,993,316,23532,5646,2889,10646,2535,553,10420,21158,29889,478,681,282,6223,29920,12866,3669,600,1358,443,7006,29889,1174,3444,29892,966,8249,316,425,10974,7174,316,11549,296,6079,875,355,29884,270,29915,14766,1540,1650,316,380,666,354,29889,1720,3031,569,712,1465,301,29915,735,351,650,29892,6701,7997,25522,25810,640,5270,316,316,7869,7697,276,553,18741,267,818,301,29915,627,29872,29899,8834,1354,454,3669,29882,1249,1249,16455,643,553,21880,15001,4999,29889,11948,1444,452,7890,454,7090,2331,29889,1720,302,29915,264,316,1004,545,2331,11387,712,966,1248,1654,414,4625,1035,2093,818,1597,1773,4279,316,21880,16035,7719,29889,2726,21880,316,2298,427,2298,1700,9735,681,904,5927,414,634,12866,2923,293,5475,818,1020,1524,610,553,9580,2487,743,5199,275,29889,1954,22094,29920,12866,29892,425,25642,8441,316,3681,439,29915,265,263,2298,316,29871,29896,29945,29900,29900,3949,279,3076,970,29879,29889,1720,707,28643,818,10420,261,439,29915,1540,25740,29892,6701,5541,1318,316,29871,29896,29900,29900,18554,29892,2653,5582,12036,261,1597,2453,1924,6366,815,553,4558,1083,609,2406,427,3133,29889,8748,274,29915,342,1671,339,7768,1577,1720,707,316,2298,427,2298,1139,270,29915,17405,271,7608,454,1020,17334,316,3058,267,21880,20364,29889,6803,1634,29539,425,29845,316,784,29875,370,9214,1318,2123,1671,6094,29539,553,6655,267,28194,553,2318,267,270,29915,513,3640,29884,427,325,819,316,5569,29889,8748,6701,1354,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,8861,12784,1750,325,993,818,301,29915,267,19428,29892,5278,5092,4371,707,2858,1547,1821,270,29915,28619,1597,5528,5084,1190,454,13665,631,316,28439,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,11266,833,280,304,19310,675,1009,3291,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,278,10974,8249,297,3444,505,694,1650,363,9068,7997,3630,338,451,9186,16232,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,278,5176,10974,437,451,505,263,16955,7997,3630,9068,1788,29892,896,437,505,2130,304,5164,848,7418,8492,322,5722,11763,1549,1009,5923,13315,22035,12425,29889,12808,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,871,29871,29896,29945,29900,29900,970,3949,18464,526,5130,297,3681,338,884,1139,519,29892,408,727,1122,367,901,1135,393,1353,310,26946,453,749,3949,18464,297,278,4272,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,12141,29879,278,7037,23633,310,3345,1218,3058,848,9068,9595,29892,896,437,451,3867,8002,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,4974,393,3345,362,508,1371,12439,23181,24413,470,5706,6655,29879,746,3058,6471,310,2305,526,2198,297,263,2183,4038,29889,2398,29892,1728,4340,9493,373,920,1438,6757,664,322,825,2702,16614,896,671,304,12439,1438,6471,29892,372,338,5189,304,24809,278,2779,20193,310,1438,5680,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,322,364,9188,272,936,9224,526,11828,297,3033,6751,278,20026,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,263,23505,2980,29889],"total_duration":73070415014,"load_duration":168952,"prompt_eval_count":347,"prompt_eval_duration":32231520000,"eval_count":318,"eval_duration":40838178000}
