{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T08:16:31.705708642Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a persuasive message. The speaker provides some convincing arguments and examples to support their claim that students who struggle with written expression can improve their performance through a combination of practical exercises and analysis of their writing. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that they spent a year working with students and teachers at a high school, but does not provide any specific details or data to support their claims about the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, some of the arguments presented are somewhat vague or unsubstantiated, such as the claim that the speaker's approach \"s'appuie sur leur point fort\" (relies on their strengths).\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling ideas and examples, there is room for more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based support to make their argument even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,23324,14119,18484,1766,17851,610,454,2654,2074,358,2123,454,1437,1111,305,482,25224,5218,29889,951,610,912,17115,29892,274,29915,342,712,274,29915,342,925,882,818,4556,316,301,29915,272,928,950,2131,818,301,29915,4582,768,29892,1750,302,29915,609,2331,2653,16454,1465,425,285,5289,1750,269,29915,932,1808,4226,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,427,26617,29532,29889,8748,19601,611,10655,29892,274,29915,342,316,534,8885,29889,8407,13310,1597,540,545,634,316,611,24407,2635,316,301,29915,493,5079,1908,904,1388,428,23497,29892,1750,707,544,5903,29884,610,6267,1841,3666,13640,295,316,12409,316,6267,289,562,410,29892,443,2730,11771,270,29915,314,15817,9386,6267,4180,818,301,29915,4582,768,29889,11948,29892,782,29899,6144,30001,29892,534,8885,443,2730,11771,316,301,29915,9989,1136,309,631,2535,454,7691,29892,2535,301,29915,4582,768,634,2535,301,29915,29948,10936,29889,8748,5695,534,8885,443,2730,11771,316,1841,862,261,1597,1967,18484,1437,5105,1318,1750,20423,11469,316,6701,29889,1281,4838,882,29892,432,29915,1794,1209,29948,1597,19951,2535,553,7877,30000,1960,634,553,23930,647,1934,868,301,11078,1318,24417,12255,29889,838,11867,29892,5366,13325,29892,818,966,1006,307,914,29892,3503,5695,818,16455,643,6267,19694,29889,6803,9551,261,1597,2134,1173,8939,13247,1387,1750,269,29915,932,29884,347,1190,6267,1298,5162,29892,269,29915,14056,23778,29892,274,29915,342,454,982,316,553,544,19669,2779,10270,316,17792,29889,6803,712,966,23930,647,1934,3435,302,29915,331,3560,454,2298,2258,455,944,1950,29889,5334,1190,4883,5065,1144,1047,4467,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,20408,294,573,2643,29889,450,25657,8128,777,17953,3277,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,393,8041,1058,21117,411,3971,4603,508,11157,1009,4180,1549,263,10296,310,15031,24472,3476,267,322,7418,310,1009,5007,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,10398,263,1629,1985,411,8041,322,27335,472,263,1880,3762,29892,541,947,451,3867,738,2702,4902,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,1009,2948,29889,19814,29892,777,310,278,6273,9132,526,10579,25160,470,443,22492,3656,630,29892,1316,408,278,5995,393,278,25657,29915,29879,2948,376,29879,29915,932,29884,347,1190,6267,1298,5162,29908,313,276,3687,373,1009,9324,29879,467,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,752,7807,7014,322,6455,29892,727,338,5716,363,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,2304,304,1207,1009,2980,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":57025178328,"load_duration":223597,"prompt_eval_count":322,"prompt_eval_duration":29445048000,"eval_count":220,"eval_duration":27579404000}
