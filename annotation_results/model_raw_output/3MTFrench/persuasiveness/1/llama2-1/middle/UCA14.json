{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T23:45:20.035091605Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker's message is not particularly convincing or well-reasoned. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Lack of clear argumentation: The speaker does not present a clear and logical argument to support their claim. They simply repeat the phrase \"you can get it\" multiple times without providing any evidence or reasoning to back it up.\n2. Unclear meaning: The speaker's message is difficult to understand due to the use of vague language and ambiguous phrasing. It's not clear what the speaker is trying to communicate, and the listener is left with more questions than answers.\n3. Lack of clarity: The speaker does not provide any clear definitions or explanations of key terms, such as \"deaf\" or \"get it.\" This lack of clarity makes it difficult for the listener to follow the speaker's train of thought.\n4. Inconsistent tone: The speaker's tone is inconsistent and unclear. At times, they seem to be trying to convey a sense of urgency or importance, but at other times, their tone is flat and unengaged.\n5. Lack of conviction: The speaker does not display any conviction or passion in their delivery. They do not use persuasive language or rhetorical devices to make their message more compelling.\n\nOverall, the speaker's message is not particularly persuasive due to a lack of clear argumentation, unclear meaning, lack of clarity, inconsistent tone, and lack of conviction.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,306,29915,29885,451,1854,565,366,508,679,372,29889,1205,306,29915,29885,451,1854,565,366,508,679,372,29889,1126,411,278,1371,310,278,316,2142,29892,366,508,679,372,29889,1126,393,29915,29879,278,982,2712,526,2675,304,2041,701,29889,1126,565,366,1016,29915,29873,505,304,679,372,29892,366,508,679,372,29889,887,508,29915,29873,679,372,29889,1126,769,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,1939,29892,445,1410,29891,29915,29879,2675,304,664,714,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,960,366,1016,29915,29873,505,304,29892,306,29915,29885,2675,304,664,714,29889,960,366,1016,29915,29873,505,304,679,372,29892,366,508,679,372,29889,306,29915,645,1827,372,363,278,1473,931,29889,1126,1246,372,263,316,2142,29889,887,508,679,372,29889,887,508,1246,372,263,316,2142,29889,887,508,29915,29873,1371,29889,887,508,29915,29873,1371,6820,592,290,7043,304,679,372,29889,1126,363,393,29892,366,508,29915,29873,1371,29889,306,508,29915,29873,2367,701,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,7726,1286,577,366,508,679,372,29889,306,29915,645,769,367,2221,304,748,297,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,5193,304,366,29892,988,1258,306,748,411,278,316,2142,29973,306,29915,345,2000,372,278,316,2142,1410,29891,1244,29889,960,306,29915,29881,1246,372,263,316,2142,29892,896,29915,29881,437,372,29991,960,306,1016,29915,29873,4658,1075,29892,540,29915,645,437,372,411,670,1024,29889,887,508,435,14112,29915,29879,9008,29892,565,372,29915,29879,451,2793,29892,541,565,1476,29892,540,723,1235,366,8293,393,29889,960,540,5717,592,29892,896,5491,1016,29915,29873,437,372,29991,306,29915,29885,2675,304,6494,372,29892,322,366,29915,645,1584,1371,592,29889,306,29915,29885,2675,304,2244,366,599,278,931,29889,1205,565,366,1016,29915,29873,505,304,1044,763,591,29915,276,451,2675,304,748,304,1105,393,471,3078,306,5131,304,2649,366,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,10734,17953,3277,470,1532,29899,23147,287,29889,2266,526,777,9590,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,2980,362,29901,450,25657,947,451,2198,263,2821,322,16667,2980,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,2688,3763,12312,278,16549,376,6293,508,679,372,29908,2999,3064,1728,13138,738,10757,470,24481,304,1250,372,701,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,6593,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,5189,304,2274,2861,304,278,671,310,25160,4086,322,22363,681,12216,5832,29889,739,29915,29879,451,2821,825,278,25657,338,1811,304,23120,29892,322,278,13254,338,2175,411,901,5155,1135,6089,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,2821,15848,470,7309,800,310,1820,4958,29892,1316,408,376,311,2142,29908,470,376,657,372,1213,910,10225,310,7542,537,3732,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,29889,13,29946,29889,512,3200,9696,16225,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,16225,338,22435,9696,322,20871,29889,2180,3064,29892,896,2833,304,367,1811,304,27769,263,4060,310,5065,14703,470,13500,29892,541,472,916,3064,29892,1009,16225,338,12151,322,443,996,4063,29889,13,29945,29889,365,547,310,7602,2463,29901,450,25657,947,451,2479,738,7602,2463,470,15935,297,1009,28289,29889,2688,437,451,671,20408,294,573,4086,470,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,1207,1009,2643,901,752,7807,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,10734,20408,294,573,2861,304,263,10225,310,2821,2980,362,29892,20871,6593,29892,10225,310,7542,537,29892,22435,9696,16225,29892,322,10225,310,7602,2463,29889],"total_duration":79004096402,"load_duration":349949,"prompt_eval_count":386,"prompt_eval_duration":35152614000,"eval_count":346,"eval_duration":43850604000}
