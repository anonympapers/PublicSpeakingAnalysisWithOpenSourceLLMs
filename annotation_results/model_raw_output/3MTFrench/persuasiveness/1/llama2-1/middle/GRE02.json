{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T08:07:43.276904982Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and imagery to convey their message, making it engaging and thought-provoking. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous, such as providing more evidence or logical arguments to support their claims.\n\nThe dimension of persuasiveness is scored on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means not at all persuasive and 5 means very much persuasive. Based on the transcript provided, I would score it a 3, as the speaker does a good job of using rhetorical questions and imagery to engage the audience, but could benefit from providing more evidence and logical arguments to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,437,27649,409,12450,5893,454,5646,427,7732,13391,29889,2169,19755,29920,26814,29899,280,29889,1954,22094,29920,29899,23088,966,10890,29892,966,1616,293,8250,29892,966,1437,29887,30057,1372,29899,29885,787,29892,13612,5561,443,28710,17948,316,2117,2911,2658,7209,24988,1004,29892,316,1840,1475,373,7147,2453,6394,29892,316,274,747,690,2301,1810,7147,29889,4241,841,424,29892,14034,29920,29899,23088,12563,5278,4280,2131,427,25924,2535,966,640,5270,3163,18342,7147,29892,425,2654,898,749,2301,1810,5218,634,966,5039,7719,13162,15471,7147,553,2301,1810,7147,29889,10043,2258,21873,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,966,25974,1144,29892,966,19015,1691,29892,437,27649,13911,333,819,17239,9073,5278,904,345,332,316,7604,4371,1671,6628,1314,23532,1487,484,316,8556,29892,966,22069,29889,422,1004,966,534,574,743,1465,2379,271,28328,29892,1444,2453,1314,623,9555,1661,2331,1597,29892,3503,4239,26957,13391,818,301,29915,1947,647,882,316,301,29915,273,8678,347,29889,2581,2453,1314,19172,276,3479,2852,4749,1934,316,8689,6267,26138,330,4196,9483,277,2637,4090,1318,634,875,355,5606,29899,1808,29892,4191,3700,443,286,3350,381,29889,11948,443,25698,5000,409,18593,29889,461,10446,29920,29899,23088,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,6311,966,20758,4110,316,301,29915,1893,1151,29973,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,6382,708,304,27769,1009,2643,29892,3907,372,3033,6751,322,2714,29899,16123,17223,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29892,1316,408,13138,901,10757,470,16667,6273,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,1576,9927,310,20408,294,20193,338,15569,373,263,6287,515,29871,29896,304,29871,29945,29892,988,29871,29896,2794,451,472,599,20408,294,573,322,29871,29945,2794,1407,1568,20408,294,573,29889,16564,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,372,263,29871,29941,29892,408,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,773,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,6382,708,304,3033,482,278,20026,29892,541,1033,14169,515,13138,901,10757,322,16667,6273,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":45742073874,"load_duration":165568,"prompt_eval_count":257,"prompt_eval_duration":23486355000,"eval_count":179,"eval_duration":22255020000}
