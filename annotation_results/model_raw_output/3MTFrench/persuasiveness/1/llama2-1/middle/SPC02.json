{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T20:36:43.152423138Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\nStrengths:\n\n* The speaker provides clear and concise explanations of their arguments, making it easy for the audience to follow along.\n* They use appropriate scientific terms and concepts to describe the immune system and cancer, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic.\n* The speaker presents data from their own research, including photos taken with a microscope, to support their claims.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* While the speaker provides some interesting insights into the immune system and cancer, they do not offer any particularly new or groundbreaking ideas.\n* The argument is largely based on observations of the immune system's response to cancer, without providing a comprehensive plan for how to tackle the disease.\n* The speaker does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether there is a way for the police of the immune system to reach the accueil (cancer cells) and neutralize them.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates some knowledge and understanding of the topic, their argument could benefit from more depth and originality in order to be truly persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1190,7814,11482,11259,28185,9373,712,1190,454,1035,28031,29889,8748,1354,425,1650,6303,316,14505,261,24145,21423,5198,348,9407,29892,4191,454,6299,966,325,5753,1144,29892,2257,3435,966,5155,712,1444,1147,17016,282,21522,29892,29871,4277,269,29915,932,1808,301,29915,6727,348,17084,2390,347,29889,1174,5246,29892,454,21423,5198,348,9407,29892,274,29915,342,425,10974,868,14913,3165,475,29889,9353,5278,10974,29892,980,343,263,966,1899,1934,29892,966,946,355,1973,23930,647,4110,634,966,1248,1654,5908,29892,3503,2257,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,29889,2664,1248,1654,414,409,3435,966,301,29915,3888,455,415,743,29889,1720,427,19947,316,10741,5190,743,634,3435,1391,1169,6728,19882,28194,454,23900,24108,818,409,13942,29877,2496,29889,11948,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,454,23900,29892,454,1035,28031,29892,274,29915,342,2594,21148,311,29889,3872,29883,9301,1671,452,2331,425,29415,966,301,29915,3888,455,415,743,316,454,21104,7608,29889,3219,1139,29892,274,29915,342,316,4048,6390,1354,980,343,26030,18097,6701,2331,443,2730,11771,1671,712,425,10974,18331,818,9073,1597,639,23493,14255,454,1035,28031,29889,6803,3805,25497,276,29892,1444,301,29915,1794,8689,1513,882,1190,454,28439,2257,1750,409,1209,1249,29889,435,29915,1794,19445,427,15373,2535,1601,20710,1883,4338,553,3581,567,316,21622,2470,634,432,29915,1794,2852,4749,29948,966,22060,2637,966,3038,2540,23900,6394,634,966,301,29915,3888,455,415,743,29889,8748,274,29915,342,301,29915,16170,29948,553,3581,1765,267,439,29915,309,343,7905,4239,6635,2445,3842,316,301,29915,3888,7334,371,29889,7747,1750,18062,6668,17851,818,301,29915,14856,1318,29892,634,2257,1750,18331,818,23990,2872,14255,454,1035,28031,1671,21104,7608,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,5015,1477,29879,29901,13,13,29930,450,25657,8128,2821,322,3022,895,7309,800,310,1009,6273,29892,3907,372,4780,363,278,20026,304,1101,3412,29889,13,29930,2688,671,8210,16021,4958,322,22001,304,8453,278,5198,1540,1788,322,23900,29892,9004,1218,263,1781,8004,310,278,11261,29889,13,29930,450,25657,22981,848,515,1009,1914,5925,29892,3704,20612,4586,411,263,20710,1883,4338,29892,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,4806,557,2264,267,29901,13,13,29930,5806,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,5198,1540,1788,322,23900,29892,896,437,451,5957,738,10734,716,470,5962,1030,5086,7014,29889,13,29930,450,2980,338,18425,2729,373,13917,310,278,5198,1540,1788,29915,29879,2933,304,23900,29892,1728,13138,263,15171,6270,3814,363,920,304,22002,280,278,17135,29889,13,29930,450,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,1234,304,278,1139,310,3692,727,338,263,982,363,278,10974,310,278,5198,1540,1788,304,6159,278,1035,28031,313,3068,2265,9101,29897,322,21104,675,963,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,9004,1078,777,7134,322,8004,310,278,11261,29892,1009,2980,1033,14169,515,901,10809,322,2441,537,297,1797,304,367,19781,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":67697378615,"load_duration":152807,"prompt_eval_count":347,"prompt_eval_duration":31987175000,"eval_count":281,"eval_duration":35709606000}
