The speaker presents some convincing arguments and reasoning to support their message, but there are also some areas where the argumentation could be stronger.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of highlighting the problem of unplanned maintenance and its impact on the airline industry. They also propose a solution by using big data to predict and prevent panne, which is an innovative approach. However, there are some points where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. The speaker mentions that they will use small sensors to record physical data such as temperature and pressure in the fuel tank during a flight, but does not provide any details on how this data will be analyzed or what insights it will reveal. More information on the data analysis process would make the proposal more convincing.\n2. The speaker refers to a \"gigantesque base de donn√©es\" that has been accumulated over time, but does not provide any specific examples of how this database has been used in the past or what kind of insights it has yielded. Providing more context on the data and its potential would make the proposal more compelling.\n3. The speaker mentions that they will use a two-phase approach to predict and prevent panne, but does not provide any details on how these phases will work or what specific steps they will take. More information on the methodology and timeline of the proposed solution would make it more convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some persuasive arguments and a promising solution, there are areas where the reasoning could be stronger to fully convince the audience of the proposal's merits.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,1700,29889,1459,17488,29892,3681,29892,1570,3088,29892,1570,3088,29892,3681,29892,3681,29892,3681,29892,5027,585,634,1465,2257,18987,316,1700,29892,373,5528,1908,553,715,1179,316,25413,1750,3435,553,13943,2631,5198,12213,275,800,316,425,325,713,311,1190,427,15617,744,4625,1437,8204,2123,1661,316,1083,13974,2265,553,20075,4110,29889,1551,3669,2350,568,8532,10019,1524,439,29915,1540,7243,484,623,2518,13871,7209,9201,316,715,1179,316,25413,29889,8748,4191,11797,325,609,6628,1314,7175,15470,29892,712,1410,4894,29878,29892,1444,325,1759,14954,4630,818,3677,1654,546,7015,7243,484,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,9580,29654,427,4239,29540,29889,28079,270,29915,24430,29892,1597,8576,316,7175,700,428,1671,4048,6390,18097,707,29899,346,712,2947,11469,13003,425,7243,484,634,1597,8576,316,4224,2459,1671,4048,6390,18097,707,29899,346,712,1444,1083,572,5793,1601,20075,882,29889,6803,425,8576,316,7175,700,428,29892,22572,29915,15669,29892,980,21668,4048,6390,712,26154,8556,1029,1080,29892,980,343,263,316,5697,1169,2117,371,1295,1750,427,29238,296,966,1700,2187,316,21880,4824,3783,29892,2649,267,712,425,5694,19113,634,425,544,1211,1465,1597,8280,29886,562,279,8399,262,782,9587,270,29915,348,1700,29892,634,1190,443,9577,4595,23396,316,1700,29892,274,29915,342,427,1727,22715,358,1597,24249,1318,1597,19340,3794,802,2967,316,21880,29889,1551,23990,336,301,29915,28661,1465,301,29915,14540,553,4802,848,29889,838,11867,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,304,2304,1009,2643,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,23505,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,12141,292,278,1108,310,443,572,11310,25413,322,967,10879,373,278,4799,1220,13661,29889,2688,884,16193,263,1650,491,773,4802,848,304,8500,322,5557,7243,484,29892,607,338,385,24233,1230,2948,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,3291,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,26649,393,896,674,671,2319,4771,943,304,2407,9128,848,1316,408,10430,322,12959,297,278,26413,23735,2645,263,16286,29892,541,947,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,445,848,674,367,29537,287,470,825,1663,5861,372,674,10320,284,29889,5853,2472,373,278,848,7418,1889,723,1207,278,24963,901,17953,3277,29889,13,29906,29889,450,25657,14637,304,263,376,29887,335,3794,802,2967,316,21880,29908,393,756,1063,18414,7964,975,931,29892,541,947,451,3867,738,2702,6455,310,920,445,2566,756,1063,1304,297,278,4940,470,825,2924,310,1663,5861,372,756,7709,287,29889,9133,4821,901,3030,373,278,848,322,967,7037,723,1207,278,24963,901,752,7807,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,26649,393,896,674,671,263,1023,29899,21646,2948,304,8500,322,5557,7243,484,29892,541,947,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,1438,29540,674,664,470,825,2702,6576,896,674,2125,29889,5853,2472,373,278,1158,3002,322,5335,5570,310,278,7972,1650,723,1207,372,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,20408,294,573,6273,322,263,2504,5921,1650,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,23505,304,8072,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,24963,29915,29879,2778,1169,29889],"total_duration":74346293588,"load_duration":228219,"prompt_eval_count":294,"prompt_eval_duration":26721890000,"eval_count":368,"eval_duration":47623643000}
