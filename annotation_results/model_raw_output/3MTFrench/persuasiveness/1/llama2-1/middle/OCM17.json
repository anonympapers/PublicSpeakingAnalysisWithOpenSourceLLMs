{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T02:15:42.691727317Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and uses logical reasoning to support their claims. However, there are also some areas where the argumentation could be strengthened.\n\nOne of the main strengths of the speech is the use of relatable analogies and metaphors. For example, the comparison of plants to humans and the explanation of how they \"wake up\" in the morning through the use of sunlight and humidity are effective in making complex biological processes more understandable and relatable to the audience.\n\nAnother strength is the speaker's use of scientific language and terminology, which adds credibility to their argument. They effectively explain the concept of transporters and how they are active in the presence of humidity, demonstrating a good understanding of plant biology.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the argumentation could be strengthened. For example, the speaker does not provide much evidence to support their claim that the nitrate transport process is \"a bit like us.\" While the analogy is creative and helps to illustrate the concept, it would be more persuasive if the speaker could provide more concrete examples or data to back up this claim.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argumentation could benefit from more detail and specificity. For example, they mention that the transporters are \"prélève\" but do not explain what this means or how it relates to the nitrate transport process. Providing more technical details and explanations would help to build a stronger case for the speaker's argument.\n\nOverall, while the speech presents some convincing arguments and uses effective analogies, there are areas where the argumentation could be strengthened to make it more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,301,29915,264,329,5632,424,13180,425,21824,1318,29889,1459,2460,7015,18254,5632,1237,29892,373,5663,6223,454,867,294,18916,29889,951,2117,4115,29892,29871,4277,16133,1064,1318,553,715,3794,29892,454,21767,29878,10870,29889,951,21767,29878,10870,29892,274,29915,342,1597,13618,270,29915,834,866,1399,11936,575,519,1671,966,715,3794,29889,10793,6062,29948,1810,484,2947,7848,818,425,2967,553,410,6772,1475,1750,4625,883,29948,454,885,324,14785,316,425,715,1647,29889,5202,424,7890,2970,29892,454,21767,29878,10870,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,4191,443,18870,316,282,10807,2249,2365,519,1671,5646,17222,266,743,279,1750,409,3390,29872,427,289,999,29892,274,29915,342,425,2967,316,425,2967,29889,7747,712,8556,4048,787,29892,274,29915,342,712,553,5697,3246,289,3222,267,818,7006,966,1301,13732,1295,29892,544,3610,15792,2257,21767,29878,10870,782,19666,553,11021,1475,29889,12390,1301,13732,1295,3435,269,29915,1131,1803,275,2406,634,1044,10270,427,29845,316,301,29915,16063,381,29889,3872,29883,966,715,3794,3435,443,7006,4191,8556,29889,951,1775,262,29892,454,14419,309,409,301,15792,29892,4875,409,1841,345,1924,4662,13561,29892,452,1045,361,2331,316,274,28059,8474,443,17478,3503,4625,16403,358,1436,29889,8748,610,1136,29948,16011,29892,2257,302,473,29878,895,316,21767,29878,10870,29889,951,541,316,611,266,17449,707,316,7199,9030,2257,1374,1690,290,8146,427,4224,5128,21867,454,619,264,1750,19947,2637,301,29915,16063,381,634,15093,427,1730,5227,275,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6716,310,278,1667,9324,29879,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,1104,17219,15690,583,322,1539,12451,943,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,10230,310,18577,304,25618,322,278,8252,310,920,896,376,29893,1296,701,29908,297,278,7250,1549,278,671,310,6575,4366,322,3165,333,537,526,11828,297,3907,4280,4768,5996,10174,901,2274,519,322,1104,17219,304,278,20026,29889,13,13,2744,1228,9324,338,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,16021,4086,322,6624,3002,29892,607,12778,6625,4127,304,1009,2980,29889,2688,17583,5649,278,6964,310,1301,1971,2153,322,920,896,526,6136,297,278,10122,310,3165,333,537,29892,9004,1218,263,1781,8004,310,8024,4768,3002,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,1568,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,21767,10492,8608,1889,338,376,29874,2586,763,502,1213,5806,278,3483,6933,338,907,1230,322,6911,304,28475,278,6964,29892,372,723,367,901,20408,294,573,565,278,25657,1033,3867,901,18387,6455,470,848,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,362,1033,14169,515,901,9493,322,2702,537,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,278,1301,1971,2153,526,376,558,3610,15792,29908,541,437,451,5649,825,445,2794,470,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,21767,10492,8608,1889,29889,9133,4821,901,16905,4902,322,7309,800,723,1371,304,2048,263,23505,1206,363,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,11828,15690,583,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":77838524913,"load_duration":155554,"prompt_eval_count":303,"prompt_eval_duration":27677178000,"eval_count":392,"eval_duration":50160748000}
