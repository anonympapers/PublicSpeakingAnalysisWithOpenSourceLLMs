{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T13:20:31.223759728Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points about the history of synthetic fertilizers and the impact of human waste on water quality, but their reasoning is not always rigorous and the argumentation could be more robust.\n\nHere are some specific criticisms:\n\n1. Lack of context: The speaker jumps quickly from the topic of urine as a source of nutrients to the broader issue of pollution without providing sufficient background information or context. This makes it difficult for the audience to fully understand the speaker's arguments.\n2. Oversimplification: The speaker oversimplifies complex issues, such as the impact of synthetic fertilizers on soil quality and the relationship between water pollution and human waste. While these points are important, they require more nuanced analysis to be effectively persuasive.\n3. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes some bold claims, such as the idea that valuing urine could produce 25 million baguettes of bread per day, without providing sufficient evidence to support these claims. This lack of empirical evidence undermines the speaker's credibility and makes it difficult for the audience to take their arguments seriously.\n4. Emotional appeals: While the speaker uses emotional language to appeal to the audience's values, such as the idea that \"on valorise et l'urine de tous les habitants de l'agglom√©ration parisienne,\" this approach is not sufficient to persuade an audience of the merits of their argument.\n5. Lack of alternative solutions: The speaker does not provide a clear alternative solution to the problem of water pollution, other than relying on the recycling of human waste. While this may be a part of the solution, it is not the only option, and the speaker could benefit from exploring other approaches to addressing this issue.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some important points about the impact of human waste on water quality, their arguments could be more robust and well-supported to be truly persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,7847,782,29871,29906,29900,29872,8115,29892,425,282,1893,307,305,326,347,707,6974,29948,29889,1551,269,29915,342,3984,818,14710,1893,7608,553,3033,23469,20674,3783,818,4595,29899,264,3921,29879,270,29915,29882,2941,9102,370,545,21983,488,634,966,5065,1475,3165,13116,3435,21617,375,297,4422,267,29889,1459,425,304,488,24087,818,521,5793,270,29915,14531,634,454,5646,4082,277,748,7425,29892,373,966,263,22588,29948,818,425,28660,29889,997,4021,2131,316,301,29915,14531,553,364,8107,5908,707,21617,29884,6635,579,19783,1387,29892,8532,373,263,1436,29875,610,6787,533,553,502,1475,270,29915,6430,2633,29889,11948,427,22917,424,966,10890,7779,681,29892,7015,502,1475,452,610,29894,23510,2331,818,1841,5231,29539,301,29915,574,8356,818,503,720,29948,316,7814,5065,1475,29889,751,1808,2432,29885,482,29892,1354,373,16497,895,634,301,29915,332,457,316,9411,966,12173,316,301,29915,351,3820,290,10500,610,275,7081,29892,1671,9073,3667,7608,868,1999,29948,29892,373,1671,8356,1391,533,29871,29906,29945,14746,316,289,10617,21158,316,6788,610,8694,29892,634,1671,29873,424,29892,22572,29915,15669,1465,5278,946,3820,290,10500,29892,454,260,2993,316,1162,29891,695,482,316,425,503,866,302,29915,342,712,316,29871,29945,29995,8532,439,29915,309,6303,270,29915,21813,29871,29945,29900,29995,980,343,263,443,8115,29889,1551,263,16797,29948,443,21423,6276,29948,5218,634,1248,6092,424,1465,27612,373,27666,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,4955,310,14710,7492,19965,309,19427,322,278,10879,310,5199,19863,373,4094,11029,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,322,278,2980,362,1033,367,901,16424,29889,13,13,10605,526,777,2702,11164,12903,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,3030,29901,450,25657,432,17204,9098,515,278,11261,310,5065,457,408,263,2752,310,18254,374,1237,304,278,2545,1664,2228,310,21180,918,1728,13138,8002,3239,2472,470,3030,29889,910,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,29889,13,29906,29889,438,874,13699,2450,29901,450,25657,288,874,13699,11057,4280,5626,29892,1316,408,278,10879,310,14710,7492,19965,309,19427,373,22473,11029,322,278,9443,1546,4094,21180,918,322,5199,19863,29889,5806,1438,3291,526,4100,29892,896,1996,901,4948,8362,7418,304,367,17583,20408,294,573,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,777,14288,16726,29892,1316,408,278,2969,393,17134,292,5065,457,1033,7738,29871,29906,29945,7284,289,10617,21158,310,18423,639,2462,29892,1728,13138,8002,10757,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,910,10225,310,29190,936,10757,563,837,1475,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,322,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,2125,1009,6273,25798,29889,13,29946,29889,2812,327,1848,5929,1338,29901,5806,278,25657,3913,23023,1848,4086,304,25530,304,278,20026,29915,29879,1819,29892,1316,408,278,2969,393,376,265,16497,895,634,301,29915,332,457,316,9411,966,12173,316,301,29915,351,3820,290,10500,610,275,7081,1699,445,2948,338,451,8002,304,20408,1943,385,20026,310,278,2778,1169,310,1009,2980,29889,13,29945,29889,365,547,310,8671,6851,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,8671,1650,304,278,1108,310,4094,21180,918,29892,916,1135,337,5890,373,278,1162,29891,19914,310,5199,19863,29889,5806,445,1122,367,263,760,310,278,1650,29892,372,338,451,278,871,2984,29892,322,278,25657,1033,14169,515,3902,8253,916,13501,304,3211,292,445,2228,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,4100,3291,1048,278,10879,310,5199,19863,373,4094,11029,29892,1009,6273,1033,367,901,16424,322,1532,29899,23765,304,367,19781,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":85048916149,"load_duration":152800,"prompt_eval_count":292,"prompt_eval_duration":26783802000,"eval_count":459,"eval_duration":58264432000}
