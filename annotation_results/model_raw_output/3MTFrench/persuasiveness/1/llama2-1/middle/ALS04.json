{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T03:57:43.231728886Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using examples and analogies to make their point. However, the argument is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The speaker does not provide any empirical evidence or scientific data to support their claims, which may limit the persuasive power of their message.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is somewhat flawed in places. For example, they argue that since humans can survive for several months without moving, then horses must also be able to do so. However, this logic is flawed because humans and horses are different species with different physiological characteristics. Additionally, the speaker does not provide a clear explanation of how the horse's muscles are adapted to allow them to survive for extended periods of time without movement.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, the lack of empirical evidence and rigorous reasoning limits the persuasiveness of their message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,751,392,373,343,1841,1579,17192,277,29892,301,29915,473,409,20531,29892,980,343,289,837,29892,17256,818,29871,29955,17478,29892,9411,966,6063,634,19449,269,29915,264,289,692,261,609,29889,6101,1444,16623,443,25595,5734,25572,29892,301,29915,21708,1465,966,286,30037,4467,5855,270,29915,6727,12213,4371,25810,13547,944,21609,524,270,29915,5474,2706,375,1810,7147,1750,452,10503,440,336,993,2331,2298,316,7732,17478,29889,1720,707,4486,271,29948,433,280,427,18308,316,611,266,17449,29892,7199,9030,3440,301,29915,473,409,20531,29892,3911,7175,2140,1249,7015,2301,7799,29889,6803,639,2265,1487,7035,29892,5734,261,454,2301,2841,270,29915,348,470,2574,29899,5892,2535,454,2301,2841,270,29915,348,470,2574,29899,1893,627,361,29892,7209,301,29915,1466,443,367,585,13222,29889,8748,1601,521,5793,7905,2123,24889,29948,553,288,11620,427,5644,262,6628,1314,316,425,363,11992,26099,437,895,29889,405,681,1029,787,12866,4224,24969,270,29915,1808,332,7175,2608,1318,553,260,2993,5697,1169,25927,316,2301,7799,316,10098,610,385,29892,427,298,2147,634,427,4370,29889,1720,592,13472,8146,3999,16784,347,6394,634,8116,453,787,29889,2581,21953,818,611,3300,453,5793,634,301,29915,29282,427,17541,30037,29880,1318,410,6772,457,29889,11001,267,3435,2428,26842,404,3794,29889,7747,3435,966,5697,3246,19612,26536,1750,4079,18165,1089,14984,7814,3038,2540,29889,8748,1465,454,2301,2841,29892,20554,3435,270,29915,1300,424,2298,24151,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,1671,21181,712,966,263,2716,2783,316,2301,1810,362,818,659,553,4679,359,316,410,6772,1475,29889,951,26379,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,553,410,6772,1475,4625,4370,3533,4285,28374,634,712,316,3708,601,344,4191,1444,26099,29892,1444,2453,1314,4048,6390,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,6455,322,15690,583,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,338,10579,5466,4695,322,425,4684,10809,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,470,16021,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,1122,4046,278,20408,294,573,3081,310,1009,2643,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,10579,17422,8734,297,7600,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,27754,393,1951,25618,508,10503,573,363,3196,7378,1728,8401,29892,769,15100,1818,884,367,2221,304,437,577,29889,2398,29892,445,5900,338,17422,8734,1363,25618,322,15100,526,1422,6606,411,1422,4824,29875,5996,21862,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,8252,310,920,278,10435,29915,29879,2301,7799,526,23430,304,2758,963,304,10503,573,363,10410,23704,310,931,1728,10298,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,278,10225,310,29190,936,10757,322,12912,20657,24481,13071,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2643,29889],"total_duration":65061319465,"load_duration":242199,"prompt_eval_count":354,"prompt_eval_duration":32622113000,"eval_count":254,"eval_duration":32438416000}
