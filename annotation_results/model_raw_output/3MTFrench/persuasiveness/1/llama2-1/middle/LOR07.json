{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T18:26:44.259902998Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and metaphors to drive home their message about the importance of adapting to the behavior of tools in order to be more efficient. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and convincing.\n\nFor example, the speaker makes a claim that \"working less quickly\" is not a viable option for someone working in an industry where time is of the essence, without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's argument that the only solution to adapting to the behavior of tools is to undergo a cognitive transformation, without providing any specific examples or case studies, makes it difficult to fully buy into their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's message has some merit, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and convincing in order to make a stronger argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2123,28185,9373,454,784,4926,316,4239,868,364,1541,1004,610,992,17252,29892,12852,12471,29871,29947,29900,29900,784,27801,316,868,364,1541,1004,610,8694,29889,8748,6079,8532,29892,1354,26814,325,895,1509,302,29915,342,2331,544,15819,29892,610,27951,361,29892,2331,2258,21873,818,3667,7608,29892,1354,4875,302,29915,342,2331,454,27044,882,316,26814,831,19428,29892,7890,8992,29920,4239,6851,29889,997,8861,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,29231,5495,11387,325,568,29889,11948,1465,1597,2637,7734,4191,443,7006,8694,29892,1597,11015,29892,274,29915,342,1597,992,17252,18402,26617,16731,29889,3201,29894,737,944,443,11872,29892,302,29915,342,12866,2331,325,336,2073,1597,2984,29889,997,26617,1650,29889,8748,427,5246,29892,425,25642,29892,274,29915,342,712,7890,4327,26477,26814,2258,15529,316,29231,5495,29889,5462,7890,7744,26477,782,20299,882,316,26814,714,309,29889,11948,5278,13852,29892,443,17103,25323,277,361,29892,1559,5278,10098,29892,274,29915,342,7890,29892,439,29915,309,343,263,966,316,7869,29879,4145,1358,29892,425,2723,457,316,26814,714,309,29889,478,681,4788,29920,316,7869,286,2249,272,7608,553,19313,29892,634,7848,1098,296,361,782,11387,316,1841,29883,647,284,1671,1841,351,381,782,2298,325,568,29892,5646,782,11364,29892,2257,17103,25323,277,361,16794,1249,8323,6042,744,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,1539,12451,943,304,7899,3271,1009,2643,1048,278,13500,310,7744,292,304,278,6030,310,8492,297,1797,304,367,901,8543,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,17953,3277,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,393,376,22899,3109,9098,29908,338,451,263,3516,519,2984,363,4856,1985,297,385,13661,988,931,338,310,278,3686,663,29892,1728,13138,738,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,871,1650,304,7744,292,304,278,6030,310,8492,338,304,1090,1484,263,25323,3321,13852,29892,1728,13138,738,2702,6455,470,1206,11898,29892,3732,372,5189,304,8072,15649,964,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,756,777,2778,277,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,17953,3277,297,1797,304,1207,263,23505,2980,29889],"total_duration":48768293462,"load_duration":275707,"prompt_eval_count":264,"prompt_eval_duration":22167371000,"eval_count":217,"eval_duration":26600140000}
