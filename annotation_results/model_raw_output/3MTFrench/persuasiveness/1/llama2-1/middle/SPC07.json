The speaker presents a clear and concise message, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that they have found a way to see the laughter of stars is not supported by any concrete evidence or scientific data. They simply state that they have developed a method called \"ast√©ro-sismology\" without explaining what it entails or how it has led to their conclusions. This lack of detail makes it difficult for the listener to understand the speaker's reasoning and assess its validity.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's argument that the way stars twinkle reflects their laughter is not well-supported by the text. The speaker does not provide any context or explanation for why they believe this to be the case, making it difficult for the listener to follow their train of thought.\n\nLastly, the speaker's claim that they have analyzed data from the NASA telescope and collected over 20,000 old stars is also not well-supported by the text. The speaker does not provide any details about how they obtained this data or what kind of analysis they performed on it.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear message, there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,1134,1950,316,8689,454,364,533,553,904,517,5475,1577,997,1841,1713,707,2123,29875,29889,6803,7199,9030,966,904,517,5475,29892,432,29915,24209,344,425,2258,15529,4555,425,19703,5289,439,29915,1808,409,1539,371,2947,564,3511,1465,454,8714,29889,1704,5278,1437,5404,337,1579,12973,6267,364,533,1750,3911,286,29915,29874,1083,234,158,141,427,20244,1190,6267,1559,16027,26891,29889,10793,8774,386,356,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,579,10651,29899,29879,1608,5458,29889,6340,286,29915,29874,6309,610,17488,712,454,14419,309,29892,24145,17222,904,517,488,29892,707,9577,6079,29889,751,29915,609,29899,309,443,260,13481,309,564,9318,427,6316,453,19505,1577,4785,309,30001,29892,8556,610,29894,787,782,1302,5411,316,611,266,17449,29889,435,29915,24209,344,301,29915,29882,487,533,553,6316,7545,904,517,5475,1671,544,2487,4447,301,29915,29948,4068,316,24145,17222,14419,309,29889,6803,18729,29892,432,29915,1794,14954,553,6316,1314,14419,2719,1465,454,24850,29889,478,681,14034,29920,5646,2257,3256,17887,7877,14785,16505,818,301,29915,30106,309,29892,3503,1671,330,18303,868,8714,29892,432,29915,4422,895,28185,9373,966,21880,634,868,14858,793,29883,3554,818,260,267,301,2247,29892,1750,707,2174,533,316,425,24206,29889,2581,26099,10135,374,17851,443,5900,709,13052,2016,1671,1437,371,312,261,966,6316,1314,14419,2719,25763,966,29871,29906,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,904,517,5475,712,1750,707,2174,533,818,5820,29948,634,432,29915,264,7468,4333,5483,2298,316,29871,29906,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,29889,9481,424,1601,22420,7289,29892,432,29915,1794,3483,952,29948,2257,21880,634,432,29915,1794,3984,427,10019,5084,4239,5434,6458,793,1671,24145,14419,309,29889,951,2298,16269,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,6773,818,9364,276,439,29915,29874,326,424,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2643,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,896,505,1476,263,982,304,1074,278,10569,357,310,10819,338,451,6969,491,738,18387,10757,470,16021,848,29889,2688,3763,2106,393,896,505,8906,263,1158,2000,376,579,10651,29899,29879,1608,3002,29908,1728,24232,825,372,875,2234,470,920,372,756,5331,304,1009,21204,1080,29889,910,10225,310,9493,3732,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,322,24809,967,2854,537,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,982,10819,3252,682,280,9432,29879,1009,10569,357,338,451,1532,29899,23765,491,278,1426,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,3030,470,8252,363,2020,896,4658,445,304,367,278,1206,29892,3907,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,896,505,29537,287,848,515,278,24206,26503,4338,322,16531,975,29871,29906,29900,29892,29900,29900,29900,2030,10819,338,884,451,1532,29899,23765,491,278,1426,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,4902,1048,920,896,7625,445,848,470,825,2924,310,7418,896,8560,373,372,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,2643,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,10757,29889],"total_duration":72671602220,"load_duration":229814,"prompt_eval_count":362,"prompt_eval_duration":33036660000,"eval_count":305,"eval_duration":39634161000}
