The speaker does present some convincing arguments and evidence to support their claim that the company is capable of producing specific antibodies for a given disease. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message more persuasive.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the company's history, technology, and expertise in antibody production. This would have helped to establish the company's credibility and competence in the field, which is important for convincing the audience of their capabilities.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker mentions that they are working on developing antibodies in other species, they could have provided more details on the progress they have made and the challenges they are facing. This would have helped to demonstrate the company's commitment to their research and development efforts, and to build trust with the audience.\n\nFinally, while the speaker uses some persuasive language and rhetorical devices, such as repetition and analogy, there are some areas where the delivery could be more polished and professional. For example, the speaker could have used more varied and expressive tone to keep the audience engaged, and could have addressed some of the potential objections or concerns that the audience may have.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some strong points, there are areas where the reasoning and delivery could be improved to make the message more persuasive and compelling.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,15390,316,269,29915,29891,289,1358,553,6062,29948,21337,6079,7175,3476,267,1671,1597,4439,328,347,14735,1318,29889,2581,872,275,712,966,1045,3246,29889,6803,1597,4439,328,347,14735,1318,29892,3503,856,2581,325,1759,4880,261,29889,2581,325,1759,4880,261,29889,6803,1597,4439,328,347,14735,1318,29892,373,3686,15802,316,10135,374,7808,7015,3677,293,2361,427,2298,6815,4323,2131,1465,270,29915,14559,5152,17893,29892,18934,316,19397,1487,1089,553,18554,818,260,2016,316,15258,4439,328,347,29889,18410,2708,270,29915,14559,4625,29892,3503,980,343,263,29892,274,29915,342,439,7768,443,3677,293,487,1577,1720,325,993,6382,4983,443,3500,631,29892,443,3500,631,634,5541,29948,316,4239,13973,29889,478,681,8992,29920,301,29915,542,272,634,966,4239,904,280,339,440,1862,270,29915,1540,2284,9874,3581,20519,29889,853,3677,293,487,12450,5893,1249,427,21907,29835,301,29915,290,1030,868,3500,631,29889,1174,20744,29892,301,29915,7716,487,427,301,29915,16063,473,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,5001,338,15390,310,20811,2702,3677,747,397,583,363,263,2183,17135,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2643,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,5001,29915,29879,4955,29892,15483,29892,322,17924,895,297,3677,747,1486,5802,29889,910,723,505,9213,304,10127,278,5001,29915,29879,6625,4127,322,5100,663,297,278,1746,29892,607,338,4100,363,17953,3277,278,20026,310,1009,27108,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,393,896,526,1985,373,14338,3677,747,397,583,297,916,6606,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,4902,373,278,6728,896,505,1754,322,278,18066,267,896,526,14870,29889,910,723,505,9213,304,22222,278,5001,29915,29879,9063,358,304,1009,5925,322,5849,14231,29892,322,304,2048,9311,411,278,20026,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,1550,278,25657,3913,777,20408,294,573,4086,322,364,9188,272,936,9224,29892,1316,408,21159,654,322,3483,6933,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,28289,1033,367,901,1248,3276,322,10257,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1304,901,23821,322,4653,573,16225,304,3013,278,20026,17785,29892,322,1033,505,20976,777,310,278,7037,704,24247,470,21838,393,278,20026,1122,505,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,756,777,4549,3291,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,322,28289,1033,367,16710,304,1207,278,2643,901,20408,294,573,322,752,7807,29889],"total_duration":61146027373,"load_duration":226267,"prompt_eval_count":202,"prompt_eval_duration":18301051000,"eval_count":335,"eval_duration":42844231000}
