{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T06:21:32.747192102Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents a clear argument and uses examples to illustrate their point, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of presenting a relatable and empathetic scenario, describing a young person with a vision loss condition that is similar to the X-Men mutants. However, the argument could benefit from more depth and analysis of the underlying causes of the condition. The speaker mentions that the technique known as genetic therapy has had successes in recent years, but they do not provide enough information about the effectiveness or limitations of this approach.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's claim that \"more than half\" of young people with retinitis pigmentosa are currently unknown could be supported by more concrete data or research. While this may be a significant issue, the speaker could have done more to provide evidence for this statement and to explain its implications.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear argument and uses compelling examples, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1465,5278,4439,328,347,29892,443,553,29026,1750,9657,296,818,425,3038,1297,29892,2257,439,29915,1808,16374,9073,29892,634,5478,261,29892,5646,4191,1465,425,10375,553,5478,1934,1060,29899,28154,1750,610,1597,5478,362,3435,12694,1237,553,18554,4356,1099,2658,29889,11948,6761,19211,818,7015,5478,1934,1060,29899,28154,1750,4625,553,2428,19397,29879,29892,966,22069,14931,1295,316,7015,5478,800,11113,296,6267,15911,17887,818,17887,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,980,11113,425,18551,316,26245,29892,1559,4875,707,17152,11586,347,4191,427,1002,275,862,21017,29892,18158,11797,4625,1597,22964,918,868,18480,316,18551,454,8694,29892,1559,4875,707,378,17508,29874,13871,3038,487,6282,634,782,2186,11797,2906,23510,8992,1314,29889,461,1671,8356,29899,265,9073,1671,966,263,1241,1577,5027,862,261,454,17222,610,17488,29892,274,29915,342,1950,29889,6803,18729,29892,373,1671,8356,27760,4087,454,17222,5478,29948,2535,425,1873,20244,316,2257,17222,29892,5646,4191,301,29915,663,439,29915,265,27760,2231,1597,2258,1082,270,29915,2072,468,2390,354,1465,443,9122,29889,10793,11043,818,443,2245,29892,274,29915,342,425,13219,2390,347,6094,21199,29889,6340,263,25456,10741,24113,29892,1067,2172,1912,7015,15159,5908,8595,29889,11948,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,872,1302,30095,371,14954,316,27760,4087,18402,5478,362,316,29026,634,872,26427,5695,21394,316,8714,29889,897,2298,29892,2298,316,425,2730,26665,553,29026,5544,1849,316,425,1841,1259,568,282,335,358,5218,29892,3435,22572,29915,15669,10440,22629,3433,29889,951,2298,26842,404,424,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,2298,4100,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,2980,322,3913,6455,304,28475,1009,1298,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,263,1104,17219,322,953,2084,7492,10483,29892,20766,263,4123,2022,411,263,18551,6410,4195,393,338,2788,304,278,1060,29899,28154,5478,1934,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,14169,515,901,10809,322,7418,310,278,14407,9946,310,278,4195,29889,450,25657,26649,393,278,11043,2998,408,2531,7492,29220,27580,756,750,2551,267,297,7786,2440,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,3307,2472,1048,278,2779,20193,470,27028,310,445,2948,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,376,5514,1135,4203,29908,310,4123,2305,411,3240,2344,275,282,335,358,3628,526,5279,9815,1033,367,6969,491,901,18387,848,470,5925,29889,5806,445,1122,367,263,7282,2228,29892,278,25657,1033,505,2309,901,304,3867,10757,363,445,3229,322,304,5649,967,2411,5795,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,2980,322,3913,752,7807,6455,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,10757,29889],"total_duration":62878291852,"load_duration":257045,"prompt_eval_count":319,"prompt_eval_duration":29520293000,"eval_count":256,"eval_duration":33357281000}
