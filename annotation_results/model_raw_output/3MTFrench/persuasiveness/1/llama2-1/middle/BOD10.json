{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T17:18:23.263604905Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \"le pain maritime\") and parallelism (\"maison de la résine\", \"la même colophane que ça utilisait par Antonio Stradivari\") to emphasize their points and create a sense of urgency around the return of the gêmage industry to the region. However, the speaker's reasoning is not always rigorous, as they make some vague claims about the quality of their products and the potential benefits of using local resources.\n\nThe scale I used to evaluate the speech is as follows:\n\n1 = Not at all persuasive\n2 = Somewhat persuasive\n3 = Moderately persuasive\n4 = Very persuasive\n5 = Extremely persuasive\n\nIn this case, the speaker shows some promise in terms of using rhetorical devices to make their argument more compelling, but could benefit from providing more concrete evidence and logical reasoning to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,425,27965,1509,363,11992,301,29915,355,17449,29889,3872,29883,301,29915,404,663,15963,707,454,6788,1766,21998,29889,8748,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,265,8164,9073,2535,454,6788,1766,21998,29973,8396,29892,553,13900,521,283,453,296,29889,11948,373,8164,5695,454,330,30037,1089,29889,315,29915,342,818,2970,454,17065,29948,1671,1841,1054,357,872,6896,457,29889,5701,6896,457,1750,707,5541,1318,270,29915,1540,8691,15617,680,29892,301,29915,404,663,316,1935,5606,29894,20578,634,270,29915,1540,8691,899,680,29892,301,29915,562,324,974,1662,29889,438,1481,29892,425,6701,784,3021,1662,712,29871,4277,22700,1249,610,9630,3767,328,27432,1671,966,1436,2187,316,7015,5537,787,29889,7740,424,454,330,19553,482,29892,274,29915,14386,1597,23837,347,611,1324,545,868,22922,3621,29948,29889,11948,980,269,29915,264,707,599,29948,1671,553,10505,1946,583,29892,766,787,11387,298,3409,25664,1509,29889,317,4987,712,8556,29892,1465,301,29915,3610,4182,29892,373,263,4193,1249,6079,439,29915,309,6664,7081,454,330,19553,482,29889,315,29915,342,1671,18729,712,301,29915,265,3686,15802,316,16497,7608,3999,1391,1169,29892,13214,872,784,3021,1662,29892,1841,649,6096,270,29915,1540,4021,2131,3682,23497,29889,3872,29883,1601,325,7181,29892,427,2298,270,29915,5474,868,12507,2265,29892,3667,895,425,18475,1167,15068,29889,10043,454,508,538,29892,10814,1661,29889,997,784,3021,1662,29889,3872,29883,1671,409,9073,3999,1027,2701,29892,1444,544,1975,8997,454,1472,29889,2581,521,6648,29889,435,29915,1794,13612,449,29948,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,280,6788,1766,21998,1159,322,8943,1608,4852,655,2285,316,425,6896,457,613,376,433,6701,784,3021,1662,712,29871,4277,22700,1249,610,9630,3767,328,27432,1159,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,1653,263,4060,310,5065,14703,2820,278,736,310,278,330,19553,482,13661,304,278,5120,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,408,896,1207,777,25160,16726,1048,278,11029,310,1009,9316,322,278,7037,23633,310,773,1887,7788,29889,13,13,1576,6287,306,1304,304,14707,278,12032,338,408,4477,29901,13,13,29896,353,2216,472,599,20408,294,573,13,29906,353,3834,5816,20408,294,573,13,29941,353,3382,261,2486,20408,294,573,13,29946,353,18064,20408,294,573,13,29945,353,7338,1745,873,20408,294,573,13,13,797,445,1206,29892,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,4958,310,773,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,1207,1009,2980,901,752,7807,29892,541,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18387,10757,322,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":62541113762,"load_duration":249261,"prompt_eval_count":311,"prompt_eval_duration":29449555000,"eval_count":242,"eval_duration":33090708000}
