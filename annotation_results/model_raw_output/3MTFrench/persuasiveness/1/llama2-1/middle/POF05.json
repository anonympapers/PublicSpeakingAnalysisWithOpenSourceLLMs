{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T15:18:55.681058823Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some compelling arguments and evidence to support their claim that the English had a significant influence on the French colonies in Polynesia before the French annexation. However, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the argument could be more convincing.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of historical records and archives to support the speaker's claims. The reference to gravure des pocs, or engravings, that show American flags planted on Marquisian soil is an interesting and compelling point. Additionally, the comparison of the number of American ships in the port of Papeete to other nations is a good way to illustrate the extent of American influence in the region.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the argument could be strengthened. For example, the speaker could have provided more context about the political and economic motivations behind the French annexation of Polynesia. While it is clear that the English had a significant influence on the region, it is not entirely clear why the French felt the need to annex it. Providing more information on this topic could help to strengthen the speaker's argument.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could have provided more nuance in their characterization of the English influence in Polynesia. While they argue that the English had a significant impact on the region, they do not provide much detail on how this impact was expressed culturally or socially. Providing more information on these topics could help to give a fuller picture of the English influence in Polynesia and make the argument more convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling arguments and evidence, there are also areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the argument could be strengthened. A score of 3 out of 5 is a reasonable assessment of the persuasiveness of the speech based on the provided transcript.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,26154,782,286,2249,14119,425,4889,316,301,29915,13453,29884,663,29409,1465,5278,2961,280,29889,4526,276,29899,1351,1924,316,23520,1190,966,3190,3145,553,282,12332,818,2011,316,8861,6896,499,271,29889,2664,23094,446,267,29892,4191,373,966,2245,655,277,818,301,29915,25165,29892,15777,20081,1465,966,17256,3190,666,1379,316,301,29915,627,2491,1248,1475,275,29899,29875,29899,7675,29883,2093,29889,8748,7015,2961,793,15777,14127,13116,10042,270,29915,5474,11076,29889,10050,2331,1597,8104,347,28763,29892,6701,1354,427,29871,29896,29947,29896,29941,29892,454,2085,17768,4699,7102,357,29892,10558,29916,29892,7814,9587,298,440,3163,29892,316,872,26138,14511,1230,29892,7209,301,29915,5753,536,316,7660,29892,1750,452,13267,29875,25404,2331,1487,1044,29872,29889,8748,7890,992,4099,29920,29871,1654,29892,301,29915,1540,553,409,7273,8310,1973,553,282,12332,6722,301,29915,265,24722,1399,336,3149,17153,29892,8024,29948,1190,454,20536,1766,7680,819,29889,11948,28185,9373,1597,9949,28763,634,443,10879,5162,10042,454,3279,10407,271,29892,634,301,29915,273,3559,610,966,1352,6899,29889,897,2298,29892,966,6411,1690,347,634,10890,6283,2658,14127,2708,15777,19445,316,29871,29896,29900,10098,2298,20081,712,966,6283,2658,553,10890,19079,1465,454,2011,316,3500,631,4370,2637,29871,29896,29947,29941,29946,634,29871,29896,29947,29945,29946,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,752,7807,6273,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,4223,750,263,7282,9949,373,278,5176,8104,583,297,2043,948,28666,1434,278,5176,385,13996,362,29889,2398,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2980,1033,367,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,15839,6475,322,3190,3145,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,450,3407,304,8310,545,553,282,12332,29892,470,3033,5705,886,29892,393,1510,3082,13449,8024,287,373,1085,7680,713,22473,338,385,8031,322,752,7807,1298,29889,19814,29892,278,10230,310,278,1353,310,3082,13968,297,278,2011,310,2621,412,2650,304,916,19079,338,263,1781,982,304,28475,278,15834,310,3082,9949,297,278,5120,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,1048,278,8604,322,17407,17385,800,5742,278,5176,385,13996,362,310,2043,948,28666,29889,5806,372,338,2821,393,278,4223,750,263,7282,9949,373,278,5120,29892,372,338,451,9186,2821,2020,278,5176,7091,278,817,304,385,13996,372,29889,9133,4821,901,2472,373,445,11261,1033,1371,304,9324,264,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,4948,749,297,1009,2931,2133,310,278,4223,9949,297,2043,948,28666,29889,5806,896,27754,393,278,4223,750,263,7282,10879,373,278,5120,29892,896,437,451,3867,1568,9493,373,920,445,10879,471,13384,4185,332,635,470,5374,635,29889,9133,4821,901,2472,373,1438,23820,1033,1371,304,2367,263,2989,261,7623,310,278,4223,9949,297,2043,948,28666,322,1207,278,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,752,7807,6273,322,10757,29892,727,526,884,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,338,263,15590,24809,358,310,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,2729,373,278,4944,1301,924,29889],"total_duration":81137622322,"load_duration":259461,"prompt_eval_count":268,"prompt_eval_duration":25161365000,"eval_count":433,"eval_duration":55975426000}
