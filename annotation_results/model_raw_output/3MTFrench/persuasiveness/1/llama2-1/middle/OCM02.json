The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning to support their claim that there are many factors contributing to the hydrological changes in the region, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker acknowledges the complexity of the hydrological system in the region, which is a strong point. However, they could have provided more detail on how their proposed model informatique would account for these complexities and why it is a better approach than existing methods. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claim that the problems with the current hydrological model are due to a lack of data, rather than other factors such as methodological limitations or external influences.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling arguments, there is room for improvement in terms of providing more detail and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,425,17546,1188,347,316,425,14326,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,980,343,263,443,4595,5419,316,2114,11620,1750,1671,764,296,443,7848,425,4556,29889,2664,8740,4110,10784,19669,6079,269,30095,29878,29892,3503,5695,425,7632,553,2594,1179,427,626,424,2123,10440,425,286,1690,5049,553,5884,22297,29889,2664,25698,19503,6299,29879,316,302,29915,314,609,284,427,904,4387,1080,7015,1874,4110,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,2719,8556,452,4048,609,2331,2684,882,4191,443,1766,1173,454,21423,17546,1188,1387,316,425,14326,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,454,1302,5411,270,29915,2249,9318,634,14954,1173,29889,435,29915,1794,3669,29882,1249,316,6787,533,443,878,15340,1871,15819,29892,4224,5606,358,301,29915,24031,553,1889,375,17546,1188,3783,553,425,14326,29889,365,29915,348,3105,332,316,425,6434,316,301,29915,14531,29892,3503,5695,966,4292,3783,553,14735,800,29889,26383,553,289,24729,21880,29892,553,289,24729,22069,29892,553,1480,1654,1446,17546,1188,3783,634,1597,17043,9948,427,1824,29885,362,29892,274,29915,342,1950,29889,4241,841,424,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,5695,926,261,1750,5646,707,6079,17756,316,425,29889,751,295,802,17478,29892,1209,29948,589,9318,443,23428,262,634,2331,782,25698,5000,6896,324,434,29889,315,29915,342,3058,882,712,432,29915,1794,7618,782,13222,316,611,266,17449,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,29871,4277,302,29915,342,8575,29948,2331,4191,29871,4277,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,393,727,526,1784,13879,17737,17068,304,278,17546,1188,936,3620,297,278,5120,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,24084,2710,278,13644,310,278,17546,1188,936,1788,297,278,5120,29892,607,338,263,4549,1298,29889,2398,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,9493,373,920,1009,7972,1904,1871,15819,723,3633,363,1438,4280,1907,322,2020,372,338,263,2253,2948,1135,5923,3519,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,4828,411,278,1857,17546,1188,936,1904,526,2861,304,263,10225,310,848,29892,3265,1135,916,13879,1316,408,1158,5996,27028,470,7029,7112,2063,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,752,7807,6273,29892,727,338,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,13138,901,9493,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":52964474836,"load_duration":160148,"prompt_eval_count":288,"prompt_eval_duration":26355198000,"eval_count":211,"eval_duration":26608587000}
