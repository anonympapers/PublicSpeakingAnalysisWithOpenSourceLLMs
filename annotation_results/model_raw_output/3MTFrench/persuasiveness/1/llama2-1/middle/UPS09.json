The speaker presents a clear and concise argument for the importance of big data in the field of medicine, highlighting its potential to improve patient care and outcomes. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and detailed:\n\n1. Lack of specific examples: While the speaker mentions the potential benefits of big data in medicine, they do not provide any concrete examples of how it has improved patient care or outcomes. Providing specific examples would help to make the argument more persuasive and tangible.\n2. Limited discussion of challenges: The speaker acknowledges that there are challenges associated with using big data in medicine, but they could delve deeper into these challenges and discuss potential solutions. A more thorough examination of the challenges and potential solutions would help to strengthen the argument.\n3. Lack of evidence: While the speaker mentions that their thesis aims to \"entirely\" explore the question of fertility, they do not provide any specific evidence or research to support their claims. Including more concrete data and research would help to make the argument more persuasive and credible.\n4. Overuse of metaphors: The speaker uses several metaphors throughout the speech, such as comparing big data to a \"mine of gold\" and an \"assembly line.\" While these metaphors can be helpful for illustrating complex concepts, they may also come across as overly simplistic or cheesy. Using more precise language and avoiding overuse of metaphors would help to make the argument more convincing.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the reasoning could be improved, the speaker presents a clear and persuasive argument for the importance of big data in medicine. With some additional evidence and a more rigorous examination of the challenges associated with this field, the argument could be even more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1632,20032,818,5278,20206,13901,744,29892,425,1190,11115,4439,328,347,29892,10961,1190,553,9080,1295,6079,7019,2764,275,743,29892,454,1437,18237,316,18402,577,262,316,18402,26744,1465,12563,425,3444,29892,966,325,30069,2484,29892,2123,10440,966,325,30069,2484,29892,634,2257,455,8997,553,8595,29889,10793,4323,2131,904,12324,29872,270,29915,19678,29892,274,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,966,4802,848,316,20877,29948,29892,966,23645,3076,316,5273,311,20877,29948,427,7691,29889,315,29915,342,1597,27128,519,7903,270,29915,272,29889,951,541,316,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,932,1150,29877,7608,29889,422,558,9030,634,1437,12031,1358,7015,4802,848,818,17103,270,29915,9564,3751,1004,1671,875,631,261,966,19313,270,29915,264,4026,3008,28230,1671,3902,9386,425,1139,316,425,19965,309,2131,29889,11948,26154,29892,316,966,27219,533,427,6361,482,10283,28148,29889,315,29915,342,4191,1354,432,29915,879,275,553,3533,29875,3163,316,639,793,29892,966,4802,848,1750,4625,1209,424,1465,966,12694,2063,818,9411,966,270,29915,1540,502,457,29892,301,29915,9564,3751,1004,4625,883,29948,553,784,27801,316,639,793,29889,16579,802,784,4926,707,454,20067,2470,316,577,262,270,29915,1540,15096,3041,22673,29889,1551,1671,8356,4048,6390,439,29915,1808,14405,966,10890,1020,667,1237,634,425,2298,6366,815,29892,22025,707,425,2298,4067,1318,818,553,285,14174,3222,267,2123,10440,29892,274,29915,342,966,19452,24571,29894,690,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2980,363,278,13500,310,4802,848,297,278,1746,310,26602,29892,12141,292,967,7037,304,11157,16500,2562,322,714,26807,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,13173,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2702,6455,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,278,7037,23633,310,4802,848,297,26602,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,6455,310,920,372,756,16710,16500,2562,470,714,26807,29889,9133,4821,2702,6455,723,1371,304,1207,278,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,18806,1821,29889,13,29906,29889,28873,10679,310,18066,267,29901,450,25657,24084,2710,393,727,526,18066,267,6942,411,773,4802,848,297,26602,29892,541,896,1033,628,345,25871,964,1438,18066,267,322,5353,7037,6851,29889,319,901,17826,4392,3381,310,278,18066,267,322,7037,6851,723,1371,304,9324,264,278,2980,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,393,1009,266,6656,263,9893,304,376,296,533,368,29908,26987,278,1139,310,19965,1793,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,10757,470,5925,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,512,22368,901,18387,848,322,5925,723,1371,304,1207,278,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,6625,1821,29889,13,29946,29889,6811,1509,310,1539,12451,943,29901,450,25657,3913,3196,1539,12451,943,10106,278,12032,29892,1316,408,17420,4802,848,304,263,376,24669,310,7684,29908,322,385,376,26936,1196,1213,5806,1438,1539,12451,943,508,367,8444,363,8632,1218,4280,22001,29892,896,1122,884,2041,4822,408,975,368,5466,4695,470,923,267,29891,29889,5293,901,18378,4086,322,4772,292,975,1509,310,1539,12451,943,723,1371,304,1207,278,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,16710,29892,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,20408,294,573,2980,363,278,13500,310,4802,848,297,26602,29889,2973,777,5684,10757,322,263,901,12912,20657,4392,3381,310,278,18066,267,6942,411,445,1746,29892,278,2980,1033,367,1584,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":80897023781,"load_duration":145951,"prompt_eval_count":298,"prompt_eval_duration":26991613000,"eval_count":423,"eval_duration":53904788000}
