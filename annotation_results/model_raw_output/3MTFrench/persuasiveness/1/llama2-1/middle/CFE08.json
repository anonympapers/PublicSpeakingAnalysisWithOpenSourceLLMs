{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T16:34:22.494014674Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as metaphors and analogies to make their argument more convincing, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by using a vivid image to grab the audience's attention, comparing the amount of food waste in France to the weight of 7,000 blue balloons. This helps to convey the enormity of the problem and establishes the speaker's credibility on the topic. However, the argument could be strengthened by providing more specific data or statistics to support the claim that France produces 20 million tons of food waste annually.\n\nThe speaker then introduces their main point, which is to find new ways to valorize food waste in order to reduce the ecological debt and create value. While this is a valid and important goal, the argument could be more convincing if the speaker provided more details on how they plan to achieve this goal. For example, what specific steps will they take to educate people about the benefits of valorizing food waste? How will they work with industries to find new uses for these waste materials?\n\nThe speaker also uses an interesting analogy by comparing the liver to a \"pac-man\" game, which helps to illustrate their point that there are potential uses for every part of the body. However, this analogy is not fully developed and could be more effectively used to support the speaker's argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some creativity in their argumentation, they could benefit from providing more concrete evidence and details to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,782,18480,29892,818,12471,29871,29896,29900,29900,4679,359,29889,8748,818,18836,316,29871,29906,29900,14746,316,16169,818,8957,29884,610,385,427,3444,29892,1444,28078,11818,5152,1908,966,3408,29879,1577,8396,29892,1444,7890,263,680,443,7006,29889,315,3100,904,339,4243,782,772,4841,316,29871,29955,29871,29900,29900,29900,6411,433,1475,10767,1041,29889,315,29915,342,427,5246,553,18167,316,1437,305,1691,818,1020,1524,302,29915,342,29899,346,2331,1577,405,681,2906,787,946,381,634,534,8885,316,10984,2993,19966,575,1671,12036,261,966,5614,3518,3246,18934,316,1841,700,533,301,29915,331,558,1657,904,21553,1387,634,9484,261,316,425,20368,332,29889,315,29915,342,2257,818,439,7768,1444,325,1759,286,29915,524,1064,16136,1465,611,19696,371,1577,2598,1203,361,29892,274,29915,342,316,534,8885,316,26957,992,583,316,16497,4371,553,633,1446,316,2011,267,29892,4191,454,7446,3712,29892,425,364,10870,29892,454,274,16581,2123,10440,454,1701,347,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,325,1759,286,29915,524,1064,16136,1465,301,29915,29948,29392,316,6062,29948,21337,1750,4625,553,1801,1691,289,25747,29888,3783,1671,301,29915,562,1760,634,3165,9874,29889,2581,325,1759,1518,492,7808,29889,349,1267,424,21285,301,29915,735,331,552,868,1701,347,29889,6803,3669,29894,759,316,2257,18308,2535,966,13568,30069,4467,634,454,17887,10814,21708,17222,29892,9790,29899,2517,29889,8748,6079,14034,29920,443,14426,712,454,1701,347,316,301,29915,25403,454,1302,305,265,1750,364,4070,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,1539,12451,943,322,15690,583,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,773,263,325,3640,1967,304,17229,278,20026,29915,29879,8570,29892,17420,278,5253,310,9687,19863,297,3444,304,278,7688,310,29871,29955,29892,29900,29900,29900,7254,6411,417,787,29889,910,6911,304,27769,278,18886,537,310,278,1108,322,10127,267,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,373,278,11261,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,2702,848,470,13964,304,2304,278,5995,393,3444,13880,29871,29906,29900,7284,23864,310,9687,19863,2889,1474,29889,13,13,1576,25657,769,4547,778,1009,1667,1298,29892,607,338,304,1284,716,5837,304,16497,675,9687,19863,297,1797,304,10032,278,321,21553,936,2553,29873,322,1653,995,29889,5806,445,338,263,2854,322,4100,7306,29892,278,2980,1033,367,901,17953,3277,565,278,25657,4944,901,4902,373,920,896,3814,304,6176,445,7306,29889,1152,1342,29892,825,2702,6576,674,896,2125,304,6320,403,2305,1048,278,23633,310,16497,5281,9687,19863,29973,1128,674,896,664,411,6397,2722,304,1284,716,3913,363,1438,19863,17279,29973,13,13,1576,25657,884,3913,385,8031,3483,6933,491,17420,278,619,369,304,263,376,29886,562,29899,1171,29908,3748,29892,607,6911,304,28475,1009,1298,393,727,526,7037,3913,363,1432,760,310,278,3573,29889,2398,29892,445,3483,6933,338,451,8072,8906,322,1033,367,901,17583,1304,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,907,28157,297,1009,2980,362,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18387,10757,322,4902,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":71272450656,"load_duration":313781,"prompt_eval_count":303,"prompt_eval_duration":25434974000,"eval_count":371,"eval_duration":45836678000}
