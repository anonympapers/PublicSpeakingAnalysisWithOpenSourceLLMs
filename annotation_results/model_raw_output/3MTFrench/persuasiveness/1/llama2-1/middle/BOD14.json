The speaker presents some valid points about the importance of workplace design and support from colleagues in preventing accidents at work. However, the argument is not developed fully and lacks concrete evidence to back up the claims.\n\nThe speaker mentions that the amelioration of workstations is no longer sufficient to prevent accidents and that colleague support is a crucial factor in prevention. While this is a valid point, it would be more persuasive if the speaker provided specific examples or studies that support these claims. Additionally, the argument becomes too complex and vague when the speaker starts discussing the infinite complexity of workplace accidents and how individual factors, organizational management, and other factors are involved.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some important points, the argument could be more convincing with more development and evidence to support the claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,29758,443,364,1941,4224,307,4630,29892,302,29915,29874,11878,443,4207,1240,316,432,29915,1131,336,412,1597,521,5793,29892,1444,25533,307,1173,301,29915,272,1941,634,443,2654,9977,5818,29892,16703,454,6282,316,21181,29889,838,943,712,1444,872,275,29892,980,21668,712,432,29915,932,295,1960,427,3444,29892,274,29915,342,24145,10823,11043,29889,951,8714,1750,325,993,29892,454,8714,712,301,29915,265,3911,1518,9854,29892,289,999,29892,432,29915,1794,19445,425,521,5793,634,1444,592,26099,5246,4439,29889,11948,270,3246,29892,274,29915,342,7890,454,14954,1173,332,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,2331,592,2970,443,7006,2257,712,7890,427,282,1947,29920,29889,11948,6079,269,30095,29878,29892,10629,11674,29889,1174,5246,29892,1444,282,1947,2684,882,4191,7890,29889,2581,282,1947,712,301,29915,314,1690,5049,553,1400,267,316,18848,452,9378,277,2298,29889,8748,1444,282,1947,5695,4191,7890,29892,712,454,13267,819,553,5321,20608,1041,707,443,553,2114,11620,25766,316,7175,7316,29889,11948,427,5246,29892,301,29915,5753,1693,868,18848,707,443,11423,707,443,10019,1690,882,8275,398,8146,4280,29872,29889,2581,7890,1518,9854,29889,15113,373,269,29915,264,2134,1173,634,2298,373,16391,553,2114,11620,4348,29884,4999,29892,26814,2852,271,316,20877,29948,29892,443,286,585,1564,275,330,4196,29889,1551,269,29915,264,707,658,647,29948,29892,373,16391,553,2114,11620,17459,1288,267,29892,425,26805,316,301,29915,1893,12478,11537,29892,610,17488,29889,8748,1354,373,2947,443,7006,2298,658,262,29892,373,16391,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,664,6689,2874,322,2304,515,23056,21628,297,5557,292,1035,16719,472,664,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,338,451,8906,8072,322,425,4684,18387,10757,304,1250,701,278,16726,29889,13,13,1576,25657,26649,393,278,626,295,1611,362,310,664,303,800,338,694,5520,8002,304,5557,1035,16719,322,393,23056,3437,2304,338,263,7618,1455,7329,297,5557,291,29889,5806,445,338,263,2854,1298,29892,372,723,367,901,20408,294,573,565,278,25657,4944,2702,6455,470,11898,393,2304,1438,16726,29889,19814,29892,278,2980,7415,2086,4280,322,25160,746,278,25657,8665,5353,292,278,10362,13644,310,664,6689,1035,16719,322,920,5375,13879,29892,8674,1288,10643,29892,322,916,13879,526,9701,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,4100,3291,29892,278,2980,1033,367,901,17953,3277,411,901,5849,322,10757,304,2304,278,16726,29889],"total_duration":52994009215,"load_duration":153404,"prompt_eval_count":310,"prompt_eval_duration":26922655000,"eval_count":213,"eval_duration":26070826000}
