The speaker presents some interesting points and evidence to support their argument, but there are also some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the speaker's use of vivid imagery and personal anecdotes to engage their audience. For example, their description of the \"thousands of bees\" that are used to protect their strawberries is both evocative and effective in conveying their point. Additionally, the speaker's passion for their research and their desire to understand why certain parasites do not play a role in protecting their crops is admirable and adds to their persuasiveness.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speaker could improve their reasoning. For example, their argument that \"certain puissons were found to be carrying bacteria capable of protecting them against their enemies\" is somewhat simplistic and does not fully address the complexity of the issue. Additionally, the speaker's claim that they will \"search for the bacteria that could potentially protect [their] puissons against our... \" without providing any further context or evidence is unclear and lacks persuasive power.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting points and evidence, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and detailed to fully convince their audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,264,766,29889,1551,263,439,29915,30001,425,521,29948,5644,262,316,610,267,2049,2247,1671,410,6772,914,7814,5227,4637,29889,317,4987,712,29892,427,5246,29892,373,263,367,585,425,521,29948,553,3533,4285,316,1900,29875,6544,29889,2664,2653,790,787,3133,296,818,410,29880,9633,261,29889,838,943,29892,1601,541,29892,274,29915,342,316,7199,9030,1671,339,7768,7015,610,267,2049,2247,452,8121,296,2331,454,17889,29889,8748,18916,29892,1444,26099,6079,2793,316,712,553,14954,1173,1295,634,1136,562,374,296,10713,19638,5908,263,2852,4749,29948,425,4768,5458,553,2653,790,787,29889,1174,20744,29892,11797,4625,1601,509,29948,427,10212,20141,712,23563,2653,790,787,15777,14931,1295,316,289,627,4745,15390,316,966,410,6772,914,8474,10713,427,29876,1654,29889,8748,29892,12866,992,309,30001,29892,19601,1671,611,266,17449,29892,1444,2453,1314,4048,6390,1354,2257,21714,425,6701,12784,2535,966,2653,790,787,1750,269,29915,14975,16011,782,1424,743,631,29889,3872,29883,29892,18097,454,1596,331,567,18331,29892,1444,21714,427,4464,521,5793,332,772,339,2249,265,634,1444,610,276,818,425,521,5793,782,2653,17387,29889,435,29915,1794,553,3234,11620,316,5227,4637,1465,12563,425,3444,29892,425,2123,453,423,553,5227,4637,782,439,262,339,264,2653,790,787,316,4883,10708,267,29889,897,18948,782,10212,20141,29892,1444,1539,29879,427,2058,443,904,2608,482,316,2653,790,787,29889,8748,1444,23520,966,289,627,4745,1750,1671,336,3104,296,18029,966,410,6772,914,8474,7814,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,3291,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,7333,385,687,29881,4769,304,3033,482,1009,20026,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,6139,310,278,376,386,681,4167,310,367,267,29908,393,526,1304,304,12566,1009,380,1610,495,2722,338,1716,3415,542,1230,322,11828,297,378,345,5414,1009,1298,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,363,1009,5925,322,1009,13521,304,2274,2020,3058,610,294,3246,437,451,1708,263,6297,297,12566,292,1009,8182,567,338,594,2460,18104,322,12778,304,1009,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,2980,393,376,14082,2653,790,787,892,1476,304,367,19436,289,5761,423,15390,310,12566,292,963,2750,1009,22595,29908,338,10579,5466,4695,322,947,451,8072,3211,278,13644,310,278,2228,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,896,674,376,4478,363,278,289,5761,423,393,1033,19998,12566,518,1552,381,29962,2653,790,787,2750,1749,856,376,1728,13138,738,4340,3030,470,10757,338,20871,322,425,4684,20408,294,573,3081,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,3291,322,10757,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,13173,304,8072,7602,1239,1009,20026,29889],"total_duration":69024955627,"load_duration":235662,"prompt_eval_count":309,"prompt_eval_duration":28547790000,"eval_count":321,"eval_duration":40476435000}
