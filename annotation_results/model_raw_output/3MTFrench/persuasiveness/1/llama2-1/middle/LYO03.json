{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T09:58:21.994786476Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness in crafting a convincing message. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker uses technical terms and jargon related to biology and cellular functions, which may not be easily understandable for a general audience. This could make it challenging for some listeners to follow the argument and grasp the main points.\n2. While the speaker provides some interesting insights into the complexity of cellular functioning, the argumentation is somewhat lacking in rigor. The speaker does not provide strong evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims, which could undermine the persuasiveness of the message.\n3. The speaker's use of analogies and metaphors (e.g., comparing the cell to a city) can be seen as creative and engaging, but they may not be sufficient to convince skeptical listeners of the validity of the argument.\n4. The speaker does not provide a clear call to action or a clear explanation of how their research could have practical applications, which may limit the impact of the message on the audience.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some creativity and enthusiasm in presenting their research, the argumentation could be strengthened by providing more logical reasoning and evidence to support the claims made.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,23719,1039,29892,373,263,4224,23048,712,454,6316,453,11537,302,29915,14386,2331,868,20498,882,818,24145,12471,17239,29892,3503,439,29915,309,6303,28580,768,1465,7814,410,4569,410,29887,22702,29892,24145,26138,594,29882,8146,29892,634,274,29915,342,818,2257,3256,425,7175,3476,712,432,29915,1639,29894,993,5075,1318,316,611,1999,1709,634,26154,316,639,30019,5903,29948,11115,29892,18934,316,7199,9030,439,29915,1808,330,8146,8164,6079,6367,8584,454,6316,453,11537,316,7814,3038,2540,29892,634,425,289,7293,15217,29892,274,29915,342,712,432,29915,1794,443,7105,271,5641,29934,29906,29892,634,274,29915,342,19601,7890,1518,492,7808,1487,17889,782,2757,316,425,3038,1297,29889,1720,21668,6079,7199,9030,712,425,3038,1297,707,782,4768,1189,2488,29892,2257,712,425,8441,707,818,301,29915,25006,2488,29889,16579,802,19951,29892,707,1597,385,18165,17239,4280,29872,3503,540,545,14735,1318,29889,13915,2535,19601,1465,425,3038,1297,8441,712,432,29915,1794,2852,4749,29948,782,13911,333,819,29889,2664,19389,3435,17667,1465,29871,1654,29892,2257,316,1775,5289,270,29915,262,689,800,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,6803,274,29915,342,6267,17899,29948,2258,21873,29892,14034,29920,454,8442,12128,610,25659,29892,443,269,2795,29875,10042,316,301,29915,264,23581,295,29889,29871,30219,29874,343,707,29892,7890,29871,22730,1465,611,3038,1297,8441,29892,9577,6079,16134,424,1601,371,29920,2535,19601,1465,611,6283,568,9200,29899,6078,29892,712,1444,7890,427,1539,29879,1465,454,18062,316,425,3038,1297,8441,29892,18934,316,7199,9030,3440,454,7006,6316,453,381,29889,6298,26814,26003,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,22944,29892,427,10767,29884,29892,301,29915,314,20600,29892,4875,694,29891,1249,782,27678,316,301,29915,21708,332,594,29882,8146,29892,27510,316,14984,966,1437,3476,1080,782,2757,316,425,3038,1297,29889,853,7006,2298,658,262,29892,1190,26814,29262,29892,425,10135,14090,1841,29873,12906,1647,29892,4875,409,8323,316,425,14710,17449,553,5541,2406,29889,1174,5246,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,2298,658,262,1190,425,26003,29892,7890,16391,29920,425,14710,17449,29892,4875,2485,568,782,16731,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,3913,16905,4958,322,432,1191,265,4475,304,4768,3002,322,3038,1070,3168,29892,607,1122,451,367,5948,2274,519,363,263,2498,20026,29889,910,1033,1207,372,18066,292,363,777,11621,414,304,1101,278,2980,322,25274,278,1667,3291,29889,13,29906,29889,5806,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,13644,310,3038,1070,740,292,29892,278,2980,362,338,10579,10225,292,297,12912,272,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,4549,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,1033,563,837,457,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,2643,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,671,310,15690,583,322,1539,12451,943,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,17420,278,3038,304,263,4272,29897,508,367,3595,408,907,1230,322,3033,6751,29892,541,896,1122,451,367,8002,304,7602,1239,18109,415,936,11621,414,310,278,2854,537,310,278,2980,29889,13,29946,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,1246,304,3158,470,263,2821,8252,310,920,1009,5925,1033,505,15031,8324,29892,607,1122,4046,278,10879,310,278,2643,373,278,20026,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,907,28157,322,23644,3173,29885,297,2198,292,1009,5925,29892,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,16667,24481,322,10757,304,2304,278,16726,1754,29889],"total_duration":76666217208,"load_duration":243765,"prompt_eval_count":421,"prompt_eval_duration":38954412000,"eval_count":294,"eval_duration":37711023000}
