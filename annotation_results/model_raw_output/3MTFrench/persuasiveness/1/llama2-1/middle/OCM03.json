{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T02:05:05.851919807Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using examples and evidence to support their claims. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic of typicité and appellation d'origine protégée. While they mention that it is important to understand the concept of typicité, they do not fully explain what it means or why it is significant. Providing more detail on this front would have helped to establish a stronger foundation for the rest of the argument.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker uses several tests and methods from analytical chemistry to study the typicité of products, they do not provide a clear explanation of how these methods work or why they are effective. This lack of detail makes it difficult to fully understand the basis of the speaker's conclusions.\n\nFinally, while the speaker mentions that they have gathered data from several wine-growing regions around the world, they do not provide any information on how this data was collected or what types of data were analyzed. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to evaluate the validity and reliability of the speaker's findings.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and concise argument, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,4078,29920,274,29915,342,443,7006,4191,26814,470,29892,26814,269,16581,29889,478,681,8992,29920,8164,29899,5474,966,286,30037,4467,26809,29892,3503,2331,966,286,30037,4467,923,345,1314,29889,8748,6079,980,427,2947,316,6701,1671,966,325,1975,270,29915,932,3610,362,29889,1174,5246,29892,427,11062,14100,29892,274,29915,342,4191,1597,6815,11449,19398,29889,8748,274,29915,342,443,822,1249,29892,427,286,29915,524,29948,23458,29892,373,425,26436,29892,425,2393,293,2131,29889,2598,541,29892,274,29915,342,316,534,8885,1597,8774,386,356,1671,2852,566,631,425,2393,293,2131,316,1391,1169,5898,623,3610,362,270,29915,17234,17512,2445,1318,29889,2448,425,7199,9030,29892,3503,5695,6628,1314,7890,427,610,1358,29889,997,10466,712,432,29915,4422,895,274,29915,342,301,29915,24209,344,7209,269,29915,279,12836,29889,438,1481,29892,980,1302,30095,371,868,15722,29888,898,362,29892,1444,872,275,29889,11948,10042,316,1437,700,2265,29892,980,21668,409,926,261,966,9892,1912,5155,29892,3667,7608,966,289,24729,8774,386,2631,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,1444,14405,28374,6987,316,301,29915,24209,344,7209,269,29915,279,12836,29892,2535,10741,7243,4999,316,1437,700,29883,300,7289,29892,454,5646,1190,1597,270,6619,457,270,29915,932,3610,362,1841,1595,347,1465,301,29915,348,553,2298,22114,325,647,1849,868,9122,29892,454,25407,270,29915,5753,307,13241,29889,315,29915,342,439,29915,1540,260,1690,1318,454,2298,1035,19755,1465,611,266,17449,29889,315,29915,14386,316,1539,2484,966,325,647,272,787,782,8442,868,1889,375,29889,1704,2257,3435,23778,1750,17043,19047,425,2393,293,2131,29892,2257,27965,1314,4799,316,11449,29889,2581,966,7468,12866,364,465,1590,4237,610,623,3610,362,1671,966,938,27083,261,1190,6267,19372,634,1190,6267,875,29882,681,291,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,2393,293,2131,322,623,514,362,270,29915,17234,17512,2445,1318,29889,5806,896,3585,393,372,338,4100,304,2274,278,6964,310,2393,293,2131,29892,896,437,451,8072,5649,825,372,2794,470,2020,372,338,7282,29889,9133,4821,901,9493,373,445,4565,723,505,9213,304,10127,263,23505,22778,363,278,1791,310,278,2980,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,3913,3196,6987,322,3519,515,16114,936,8950,6020,304,6559,278,2393,293,2131,310,9316,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,2821,8252,310,920,1438,3519,664,470,2020,896,526,11828,29889,910,10225,310,9493,3732,372,5189,304,8072,2274,278,8405,310,278,25657,29915,29879,21204,1080,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,393,896,505,22229,848,515,3196,19006,29899,29887,798,292,12786,2820,278,3186,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2472,373,920,445,848,471,16531,470,825,4072,310,848,892,29537,287,29889,910,10225,310,1301,862,3819,3732,372,5189,304,14707,278,2854,537,322,12536,3097,310,278,25657,29915,29879,1284,886,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":74804346301,"load_duration":165812,"prompt_eval_count":364,"prompt_eval_duration":32797055000,"eval_count":326,"eval_duration":42006725000}
