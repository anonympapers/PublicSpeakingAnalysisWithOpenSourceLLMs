The speaker does an adequate job of presenting their argument and addressing potential objections, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more concrete evidence and examples to support their claims about the benefits of using artificial intelligence in the field of engineering. While they mention that AI can process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, they do not provide any specific examples of how this has improved the quality or speed of engineering work. Additionally, they could have addressed potential objections to their argument, such as concerns about job displacement or ethical considerations related to AI use.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous in some places. For example, when discussing the limitations of human intelligence, they simply state that \"on est des Ãªtres humains\" without providing any specific examples or evidence to support this claim. Similarly, when discussing the benefits of AI, they do not provide any clear definitions or explanations of how these benefits are achieved.\n\nOverall, while the speaker makes some valid points about the potential benefits of using artificial intelligence in engineering, there are areas where their argument could be strengthened to make it more convincing and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,269,29915,12478,283,346,10767,29884,29892,1487,13137,316,6013,634,966,4145,29049,681,316,1487,25740,29889,16932,452,7199,296,2331,301,29915,524,1064,11992,316,1601,18848,29892,6701,11797,10420,296,439,29915,309,707,297,329,488,29889,11948,610,8116,2719,29892,11797,11465,296,2535,19601,29889,1174,5246,29892,12255,707,443,14738,270,29915,4548,4894,663,29889,16932,17043,277,296,818,9551,316,7015,14884,29889,11948,18679,439,29915,265,707,553,29871,30037,5888,3165,2708,634,24145,325,3246,344,868,3408,634,301,29915,6727,2131,29892,12255,302,29915,279,4401,2331,818,15882,15237,25595,358,454,619,264,2637,301,29915,29948,3944,634,454,1136,29948,3910,270,29915,1540,7243,484,29889,8748,1354,18916,29892,2123,623,2518,13871,301,29915,5215,749,316,301,29915,524,28286,19069,11381,29892,1750,8164,1020,1524,2298,25595,358,634,2298,875,20564,2257,712,8556,4048,787,20737,427,7483,275,424,24145,1518,4894,663,29889,435,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,10042,316,6282,1089,4883,3093,3751,4467,29892,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,611,266,17449,610,2852,566,347,301,29915,2487,265,1212,26318,29892,1750,378,2265,484,301,29915,342,283,14090,316,18165,17239,270,29915,6727,496,262,29889,6101,23371,275,3435,16805,944,1095,3011,351,743,29892,1661,13499,262,5326,29892,1601,16731,29892,15382,898,1647,29892,2123,6701,867,2593,3409,29948,1190,553,282,2754,414,29889,2598,1203,361,634,868,13436,11728,274,29915,342,27282,29892,626,15817,9386,301,29915,272,4021,2131,634,316,4511,261,818,4883,508,1306,29889,13737,4182,358,29892,7199,1581,454,20299,882,270,29915,6727,348,882,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,947,385,19967,339,403,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,322,3211,292,7037,704,24247,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,18387,10757,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,23633,310,773,23116,21082,297,278,1746,310,21639,29889,5806,896,3585,393,319,29902,508,1889,2919,26999,310,848,9098,322,29497,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,310,920,445,756,16710,278,11029,470,6210,310,21639,664,29889,19814,29892,896,1033,505,20976,7037,704,24247,304,1009,2980,29892,1316,408,21838,1048,4982,12272,9552,470,11314,936,2050,800,4475,304,319,29902,671,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,297,777,7600,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,5353,292,278,27028,310,5199,21082,29892,896,3763,2106,393,376,265,707,553,29871,30037,5888,3165,2708,29908,1728,13138,738,2702,6455,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,20175,29892,746,5353,292,278,23633,310,319,29902,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2821,15848,470,7309,800,310,920,1438,23633,526,14363,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3732,777,2854,3291,1048,278,7037,23633,310,773,23116,21082,297,21639,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":66878191065,"load_duration":213222,"prompt_eval_count":320,"prompt_eval_duration":28806690000,"eval_count":298,"eval_duration":38070772000}
