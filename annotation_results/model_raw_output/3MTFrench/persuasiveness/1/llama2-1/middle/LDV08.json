{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T17:49:43.111883296Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points about the potential negative effects of antibiotics and the importance of preserving good bacteria in the gut. However, the speech lacks depth and rigor in its argumentation.\n\nThe speaker makes some general statements about the dangers of antibiotics without providing any concrete evidence or scientific backing to support their claims. For example, they mention that antibiotics can attack good bacteria in the gut, but they do not provide any data or research to demonstrate this. Additionally, the speaker's argumentation is often based on anecdotal evidence and personal experience, rather than scientific studies or empirical data.\n\nFurthermore, the speaker's conclusion that we should not test new medications on humans is unrealistic and ignores the ethical considerations of clinical trials. While it is true that clinical trials can be risky and have unintended consequences, they are also a crucial step in ensuring that new medications are safe and effective before they are approved for use in humans.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid concerns about the potential negative effects of antibiotics, their arguments are not well supported by evidence or scientific research. A more rigorous and evidence-based approach would be needed to make a persuasive argument on this topic.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2298,1354,425,1436,2131,29892,1354,7890,992,4099,29920,2257,712,1444,2453,1314,2970,29889,7747,9982,21871,15943,276,29892,980,8164,7848,270,30095,818,12694,1237,2114,11620,29889,853,13019,640,9103,29948,29892,301,29915,2882,29950,2882,6670,316,341,30000,944,610,17488,29889,438,29884,6079,6701,29892,443,10283,293,1166,610,17488,29889,751,392,7890,544,10281,443,9418,29899,5365,327,1387,29892,9577,18484,7890,8992,29920,4439,782,9712,276,29889,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,610,346,712,301,29915,424,747,24414,1387,452,872,277,2331,9073,425,12694,663,2637,966,289,24729,634,966,286,585,1564,4637,1250,6772,2722,29889,315,29915,342,443,282,30095,29880,316,29871,29900,634,274,9504,787,5646,1190,1487,13382,29889,8748,18916,29892,10814,29926,473,553,1437,29887,30057,1372,29889,7747,712,301,29915,265,872,277,19601,29892,274,29915,342,712,7814,289,24729,1250,6772,2722,20423,269,29915,14975,7808,782,10283,293,1166,712,301,29915,265,16067,1671,454,7697,276,297,4925,29889,422,1004,966,10283,293,20060,3435,1399,11936,575,1849,818,24145,10503,347,29892,634,1671,10019,1524,316,1243,261,966,3105,1973,1190,7890,29892,2123,6079,1190,19601,29892,2535,14984,966,25698,2249,19669,712,29871,4277,2411,492,7808,1249,29889,2664,17124,6609,712,432,29915,1794,5246,712,5291,13933,611,266,17449,3435,316,1162,29878,1318,29892,1597,23729,938,342,979,19069,11381,782,10212,20141,29889,319,4951,316,1243,261,553,2258,1169,553,3105,1973,10283,293,20060,1190,7814,289,24729,1250,6772,2722,29889,11948,8648,29892,316,4880,261,1354,8556,2331,9073,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,7037,8178,9545,310,3677,747,24414,1199,322,278,13500,310,2225,29530,1781,289,5761,423,297,278,22341,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,10809,322,12912,272,297,967,2980,362,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3732,777,2498,9506,1048,278,270,13873,310,3677,747,24414,1199,1728,13138,738,18387,10757,470,16021,27436,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,3677,747,24414,1199,508,5337,1781,289,5761,423,297,278,22341,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,848,470,5925,304,22222,445,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,362,338,4049,2729,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,7271,29892,3265,1135,16021,11898,470,29190,936,848,29889,13,13,29943,332,721,5514,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,15997,393,591,881,451,1243,716,13589,800,373,25618,338,443,6370,4695,322,5330,2361,278,11314,936,2050,800,310,24899,936,3367,1338,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,24899,936,3367,1338,508,367,5161,3459,322,505,443,524,2760,27721,29892,896,526,884,263,7618,1455,4331,297,5662,3864,393,716,13589,800,526,9109,322,11828,1434,896,526,23454,363,671,297,25618,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,21838,1048,278,7037,8178,9545,310,3677,747,24414,1199,29892,1009,6273,526,451,1532,6969,491,10757,470,16021,5925,29889,319,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,2948,723,367,4312,304,1207,263,20408,294,573,2980,373,445,11261,29889],"total_duration":64709196568,"load_duration":262304,"prompt_eval_count":314,"prompt_eval_duration":26350149000,"eval_count":314,"eval_duration":38358169000}
