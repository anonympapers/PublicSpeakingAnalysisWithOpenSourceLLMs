{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T20:29:01.538225723Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker provides some relevant information about the patient's medical history, such as previous illnesses or injuries, which helps to establish a clear understanding of the patient's condition.\n2. However, the speaker also repeats some information multiple times throughout the transcript, without providing any new insights or perspectives. This can make the speech feel repetitive and lacking in depth.\n3. The speaker's reasoning is not always rigorous, as they often rely on generalizations or assumptions without providing sufficient evidence to support their claims. For example, when discussing the patient's mal de garge, the speaker simply states that the medic will treat it without providing any explanation or analysis of the patient's symptoms.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some useful information about the patient's medical history, their ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning is limited by their reliance on repetition and generalizations.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,3479,678,326,601,2123,10440,553,4356,3409,2925,316,12409,29892,3503,7015,1426,267,640,23510,553,19313,13499,262,5326,2649,267,712,966,13752,30000,6609,868,25974,262,1190,454,16500,2123,10440,966,2635,7799,553,3483,952,267,439,29915,309,263,1014,29875,29889,6803,16455,643,7015,1426,267,29892,1444,325,1759,3667,7608,553,3093,3751,4467,712,432,29915,932,514,1572,29875,714,2719,29889,8748,427,22700,424,7015,714,2719,29892,1444,325,1759,316,7869,337,280,369,443,553,13830,11482,275,316,301,29915,24209,344,316,1842,1750,378,2265,484,29769,553,289,22730,25406,7719,29889,9194,794,966,25974,1144,1750,4625,553,22069,1424,29948,16011,325,609,9073,553,5614,631,784,4237,2637,966,13659,29879,868,16500,1671,17161,261,1597,9637,316,1487,23396,10283,28148,29889,7747,1750,409,21714,610,17488,29892,7890,325,10281,14255,26814,25974,262,454,29871,29896,29945,8891,29871,29906,29900,29896,29945,634,7890,8992,29920,1597,285,1461,545,868,13137,29889,8748,1465,454,13659,29892,454,25974,262,2947,904,699,276,29892,1444,2225,9695,29871,29941,3031,13116,270,29915,1131,295,29889,29871,29946,6063,2298,11364,29892,7890,20957,6096,1671,443,4439,316,7171,479,634,18916,980,2947,5614,631,784,1358,425,16549,24618,1377,29871,29946,6063,2298,260,9373,29892,3503,7209,527,1803,276,425,2635,29889,951,25974,262,4323,7004,4583,29892,966,2793,267,634,425,1487,3603,347,10283,28148,29889,11948,454,611,398,29892,4883,714,2719,4323,361,325,609,22272,2257,19696,371,29892,11797,325,609,7199,9030,712,454,25974,262,2947,1020,1524,26814,4439,316,7171,479,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8018,2472,1048,278,16500,29915,29879,16083,4955,29892,1316,408,3517,4486,2264,267,470,10899,14886,29892,607,6911,304,10127,263,2821,8004,310,278,16500,29915,29879,4195,29889,13,29906,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,884,5565,1446,777,2472,2999,3064,10106,278,1301,924,29892,1728,13138,738,716,1663,5861,470,3736,1103,3145,29889,910,508,1207,278,12032,4459,21159,3321,322,10225,292,297,10809,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,408,896,4049,19104,373,2498,17063,470,20813,1728,13138,8002,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,5353,292,278,16500,29915,29879,4439,316,7171,479,29892,278,25657,3763,5922,393,278,13589,674,7539,372,1728,13138,738,8252,470,7418,310,278,16500,29915,29879,25828,4835,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,5407,2472,1048,278,16500,29915,29879,16083,4955,29892,1009,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,338,9078,491,1009,12536,749,373,21159,654,322,2498,17063,29889],"total_duration":60010322573,"load_duration":239117,"prompt_eval_count":316,"prompt_eval_duration":28703966000,"eval_count":248,"eval_duration":31305543000}
