{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T02:08:08.485982216Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and emotional language to highlight the problems with the current state of the market, but their reasoning is not always rigorous or based on solid evidence.\n\nThe speaker's use of vivid imagery and metaphors (\"the machine,\" \"the myroids\") helps to make their points more memorable and engaging for the audience. However, some of their arguments are based on generalizations or assumptions that are not fully supported by data or logical reasoning. For example, their claim that the market is \"sick\" and needs to be \"soothed\" is not backed up by any specific evidence or research.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of hyperbole (\"the conventionnel,\" \"la guerre des prix\") can come across as overly dramatic or sensationalistic, which may undermine their credibility and persuasiveness.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's emotional appeals and rhetorical devices are effective in capturing the audience's attention, their reasoning and evidence-based arguments could be stronger to make a more convincing case.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,439,29915,1808,10804,6303,12036,1318,1671,7890,2653,790,381,425,521,2131,29889,2661,29899,346,712,454,3234,5411,263,6079,1841,1195,29948,1841,29973,12390,5155,3435,782,274,16581,316,1601,1261,271,17449,29889,1720,21668,409,966,926,261,1671,10019,1524,316,9483,533,966,263,1973,868,1209,29948,29889,315,29915,342,454,868,15687,9139,29892,425,12573,553,19590,29892,966,23930,27360,1750,4079,425,24228,29892,553,3234,11620,1750,452,409,5146,296,2331,29889,2664,8575,743,316,301,29915,370,13095,29892,29871,4277,325,424,10440,29892,3503,29871,4277,16380,479,9577,325,568,29892,2298,29871,29896,29995,316,8182,9948,29892,7209,9953,424,316,409,2281,9945,29889,3872,29883,274,29915,342,16134,424,439,29915,309,21668,2453,5495,818,425,20877,29948,553,8575,743,29889,2581,26099,270,29915,25375,332,265,427,5374,5458,23837,1387,29892,443,6094,11542,553,8575,743,29892,634,425,20877,29948,6267,20877,29948,1437,14081,443,7006,316,7890,1597,2730,6693,427,1136,3011,7289,29889,11948,26154,425,26722,818,3711,29883,744,29892,966,9221,12906,371,1295,29892,966,7825,1512,1314,634,966,2320,294,1144,29892,724,609,1437,14081,1934,4191,966,427,629,265,1179,270,29915,1540,4933,29889,461,980,269,29915,442,293,1297,1671,534,8885,6267,904,339,15943,276,29973,7747,712,1671,577,21216,454,286,866,332,29892,980,21668,20737,4048,6390,316,439,7768,980,707,5246,29892,454,7697,7962,29892,7962,29892,13052,1821,29889,838,943,4191,1465,966,12298,29892,1444,966,1437,336,533,454,590,1007,29879,1671,19397,623,9555,6267,298,6844,29889,349,4664,7175,3476,15471,29892,1444,454,7468,1465,425,14326,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,23023,1848,4086,304,12141,278,4828,411,278,1857,2106,310,278,9999,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,470,2729,373,7773,10757,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,1539,12451,943,4852,1552,4933,1699,376,1552,590,1007,29879,1159,6911,304,1207,1009,3291,901,26959,519,322,3033,6751,363,278,20026,29889,2398,29892,777,310,1009,6273,526,2729,373,2498,17063,470,20813,393,526,451,8072,6969,491,848,470,16667,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,5995,393,278,9999,338,376,29879,860,29908,322,4225,304,367,376,578,720,287,29908,338,451,1250,287,701,491,738,2702,10757,470,5925,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,4852,1552,15687,9139,1699,376,433,12573,553,19590,1159,508,2041,4822,408,975,368,8541,2454,470,4771,1288,4695,29892,607,1122,563,837,457,1009,6625,4127,322,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,364,9188,272,936,9224,526,11828,297,4332,3864,278,20026,29915,29879,8570,29892,1009,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,6273,1033,367,23505,304,1207,263,901,17953,3277,1206,29889],"total_duration":63579412472,"load_duration":228775,"prompt_eval_count":325,"prompt_eval_duration":29418805000,"eval_count":268,"eval_duration":34159897000}
