{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T08:04:42.935145448Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker presents a clear and concise message about the potential of antibodies in medicine, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker does not provide enough evidence to support their claims about the effectiveness and safety of antibodies. While they mention that antibodies have a \"very fort potentiel,\" they do not provide any data or research to back up this statement. Additionally, the speaker does not address potential counterarguments or potential risks associated with the use of antibodies in medicine.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's use of analogies and metaphors can be confusing at times. For example, the comparison of antibodies to a \"very fort potentiel\" is not entirely clear, and the reference to a \"chercheur chien\" is not relevant to the argument being made. Clarity and simplicity in language are important for effective communication, and the speaker could benefit from using more straightforward language in their argumentation.\n\nFinally, the speaker does not provide a clear conclusion or summary of their main points. While they mention that they will \"se concentrer plus particuli√®rement sur les interfaces,\" it is not entirely clear how this relates to the rest of the speech or what the speaker intends to argue. A clearer conclusion and summary of the main points would help to reinforce the persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas about antibodies in medicine, there are areas where the argument could be strengthened through the use of more evidence, clarity in language, and a clearer conclusion.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,610,346,712,18097,373,966,263,1597,21753,29892,980,24722,7848,15390,316,25238,13639,966,3038,2540,4439,3076,1465,24145,14913,29892,610,17488,29892,553,3038,2540,5178,2719,14652,267,634,966,904,2576,4983,5646,427,7175,2140,424,966,3038,2540,269,22702,29889,315,29915,342,12866,553,10283,293,20060,2535,443,9577,5162,3104,296,709,29892,439,29915,4999,3435,9577,6366,3302,2535,9577,7006,553,16449,553,474,4201,793,29889,11948,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,21668,16134,381,6267,3829,2069,4379,29889,6803,592,7199,9030,2257,6964,29892,1444,325,1759,592,1841,3666,261,316,10984,2993,325,583,427,16464,818,443,385,29889,6101,1444,11504,10646,610,17488,29892,443,14954,1173,332,521,819,29892,1444,26099,443,14954,1173,332,521,819,29892,20737,24145,1006,29882,3121,545,707,5161,802,270,29915,5474,1209,519,358,9982,279,1100,24697,29889,8748,427,2298,29892,373,2947,11113,276,454,4771,316,24145,16549,29889,8748,1671,966,3677,293,272,567,29892,274,29915,342,9541,309,29889,6101,373,11113,425,3829,2069,4379,316,425,6062,29948,1810,484,29892,373,11113,1487,5039,2131,29889,2581,592,10484,276,2298,16530,20564,1190,966,19510,29889,10016,5067,29892,29871,4277,2947,1437,2576,1524,29871,29906,2316,13805,1750,452,409,286,3610,927,2331,29889,422,1004,610,17488,29892,425,1650,3677,293,272,567,1750,707,270,29915,8284,1295,2730,533,634,454,12796,270,29915,1540,269,16581,3033,434,29889,8407,19666,316,7015,19510,29892,966,3677,293,272,567,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2643,1048,278,7037,310,3677,747,397,583,297,26602,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,3307,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,322,15332,310,3677,747,397,583,29889,5806,896,3585,393,3677,747,397,583,505,263,376,1201,5162,3104,296,709,1699,896,437,451,3867,738,848,470,5925,304,1250,701,445,3229,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,947,451,3211,7037,6795,25699,470,7037,5161,2039,6942,411,278,671,310,3677,747,397,583,297,26602,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,15690,583,322,1539,12451,943,508,367,16051,472,3064,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,10230,310,3677,747,397,583,304,263,376,1201,5162,3104,296,709,29908,338,451,9186,2821,29892,322,278,3407,304,263,376,4630,1173,332,521,819,29908,338,451,8018,304,278,2980,1641,1754,29889,15183,537,322,23205,297,4086,526,4100,363,11828,12084,29892,322,278,25657,1033,14169,515,773,901,20837,4086,297,1009,2980,362,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,15997,470,15837,310,1009,1667,3291,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,674,376,344,10484,2872,2298,16530,20564,1190,966,19510,1699,372,338,451,9186,2821,920,445,1104,1078,304,278,1791,310,278,12032,470,825,278,25657,938,1975,304,27754,29889,319,26135,15997,322,15837,310,278,1667,3291,723,1371,304,15561,10118,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,1048,3677,747,397,583,297,26602,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,1549,278,671,310,901,10757,29892,7542,537,297,4086,29892,322,263,26135,15997,29889],"total_duration":75809310128,"load_duration":257900,"prompt_eval_count":300,"prompt_eval_duration":27534790000,"eval_count":377,"eval_duration":48273703000}
