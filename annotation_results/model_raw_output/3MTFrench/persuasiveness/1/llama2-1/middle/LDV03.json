{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T17:48:38.389970453Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score the speech a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and uses rhetorical devices to make their message more compelling. However, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the argumentation could be stronger.\n\nOne of the strengths of the speech is the use of vivid imagery and metaphors to help illustrate the points being made. For example, the comparison of the skin's microbiome to a \"modem\" and the idea that the Stafilococ doré is like an \"ideal suspension number 2\" are effective in conveying the importance of these factors to the listener.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speaker could have provided more evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims. For example, while the speaker mentions that the virus of RPEC is inculpable for the risk of exéma airpétique, they do not provide any concrete data or scientific studies to back up this claim. Similarly, while the speaker suggests that the Stafilococ doré produces numerous toxins, they do not provide any information on how these toxins affect the skin or why they are more harmful than other types of bacteria.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some strong points, there are also areas where the reasoning and evidence could be stronger to make the argument more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,3058,1487,298,555,650,4191,19449,712,301,29915,265,5663,6223,14255,7890,427,1436,6056,6311,634,14255,19601,29889,360,29915,14559,3435,5697,1169,286,3698,4191,19449,316,330,1064,2249,347,29889,8407,8714,29892,7890,2970,712,18729,29892,980,452,3435,2331,9577,9577,29378,27478,29889,19551,802,432,29915,1175,2663,868,24424,316,425,390,4162,29907,29892,7814,1559,21203,542,267,29892,6056,2993,29892,301,29915,3451,30037,1173,316,23990,2872,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,966,1559,21203,542,267,29892,5198,1535,316,330,1064,2249,347,29892,452,3435,2331,2117,1849,316,2257,11482,9030,29889,951,24424,2637,1465,425,1236,585,707,2257,6674,492,6079,2298,2258,455,944,29889,951,1147,8977,707,7209,16794,29889,315,29915,342,316,425,541,316,285,1794,569,29889,951,24424,316,425,390,4162,29907,707,12866,297,1810,29886,29948,1671,5161,802,270,29915,735,15537,4799,29886,19971,29889,11948,1597,14857,1559,16027,26891,316,425,589,655,634,270,29915,271,459,1387,592,1539,425,2298,4497,487,1924,29889,951,9200,915,332,316,5700,273,29948,29892,29871,4277,7890,6309,21907,12784,29889,1605,2093,818,425,4464,427,2257,3256,29892,980,707,10719,29948,1465,9577,4595,5419,316,282,627,29948,2722,634,3686,296,28119,818,301,29915,21871,15943,276,316,26814,13185,29889,11948,992,309,30001,29892,454,9200,915,332,316,330,1064,2249,347,707,6079,11387,6894,29792,29889,8748,454,9523,1777,542,542,16630,29948,707,443,6836,16474,29889,7747,9523,1777,542,542,767,371,2658,344,1559,980,27666,316,25226,304,29916,1475,29892,2257,1750,707,427,5246,443,8872,355,954,10651,29871,29906,1178,21659,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,1207,1009,2643,901,752,7807,29889,2398,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2980,362,1033,367,23505,29889,13,13,6716,310,278,9324,29879,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,1539,12451,943,304,1371,28475,278,3291,1641,1754,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,10230,310,278,19309,29915,29879,9200,5365,608,304,263,376,8513,29885,29908,322,278,2969,393,278,7434,1777,542,542,16630,29948,338,763,385,376,680,284,8872,2673,1353,29871,29906,29908,526,11828,297,378,345,5414,278,13500,310,1438,13879,304,278,13254,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,393,278,24424,310,390,4162,29907,338,297,1810,29886,519,363,278,12045,310,429,15537,4799,29886,19971,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,848,470,16021,11898,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,20175,29892,1550,278,25657,14661,393,278,7434,1777,542,542,16630,29948,13880,12727,304,29916,1144,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2472,373,920,1438,304,29916,1144,6602,278,19309,470,2020,896,526,901,10311,1319,1135,916,4072,310,289,5761,423,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,756,777,4549,3291,29892,727,526,884,10161,988,278,24481,322,10757,1033,367,23505,304,1207,278,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":66113525815,"load_duration":249510,"prompt_eval_count":327,"prompt_eval_duration":27492312000,"eval_count":316,"eval_duration":38620418000}
