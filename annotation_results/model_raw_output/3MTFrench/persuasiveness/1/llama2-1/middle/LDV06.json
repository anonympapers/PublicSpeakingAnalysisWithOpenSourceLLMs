{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T17:52:01.507135722Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker is able to effectively convey their message and use rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \"blot-cage pels-cy\") and metaphors (\"arranger les arbassels 6 arbres\") to engage the audience. However, there are some areas where the speaker could improve:\n\n1. Clarity: At times, the speaker's delivery can be a bit unclear or mumbled, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. For example, in the line \"Delta 1. La numérode est bien coincée, mais ne sont plein pas,\" it's not entirely clear what the speaker is saying.\n2. Evidence: While the speaker provides some evidence for their claims (e.g., the existence of different types of pels-cy), they could benefit from providing more concrete examples or scientific studies to support their argument.\n3. Logical flow: At times, the speaker's logic can be a bit hard to follow, particularly in the section where they discuss the different types of arbassels and their relationship to the CR-3. It would be helpful if they could provide more context or connective tissue between their ideas.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates some skill in using rhetorical devices and constructing an argument, there are areas where they could improve in terms of clarity and evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,29871,29953,29899,29929,634,29871,29946,29892,301,29915,11236,2131,868,17861,29899,29906,707,3964,8675,29948,29889,997,3765,29899,29880,895,270,29915,3035,29940,29892,7890,3635,2353,29920,316,9073,425,3928,749,29892,29871,29953,409,1841,3666,296,818,1999,327,29892,29871,29929,818,274,482,29892,29871,29946,818,29549,29899,1270,29889,3164,327,29899,29883,482,29549,29899,1270,29889,2664,29549,29899,1270,3435,553,7191,10067,2361,1465,7814,3038,2540,29889,3872,29883,28194,1444,6668,802,966,29549,29899,1270,29892,454,15600,29899,29941,707,11387,5039,29948,29889,438,1481,3503,980,343,263,21394,316,29549,29899,1270,12694,1237,1465,301,29915,6388,6386,634,980,454,18062,13545,1473,267,29889,435,29915,264,7468,274,747,12898,29871,29941,29892,1750,3435,5814,1237,1465,966,282,5059,787,29889,26079,325,10281,966,339,1379,25763,872,13618,29892,425,282,1064,314,680,316,29549,29899,1270,29889,341,1004,29899,29891,29899,29891,29899,280,29892,1444,7890,18332,443,1399,625,29889,997,954,22462,484,707,425,24407,316,425,2967,29889,360,2554,29871,29896,29889,997,954,10651,311,707,6079,22819,1318,29892,3503,452,3435,5644,262,2331,29889,402,2735,29871,29896,29889,8748,425,954,10651,311,29871,29941,8164,8689,2298,658,262,712,14984,966,10890,29889,350,1187,29871,29941,29889,3767,293,371,29899,29890,13533,29899,29920,2749,4983,371,29889,350,481,20864,29899,2749,4983,371,29889,12390,564,29890,465,1379,29871,29953,564,16105,29889,478,681,7890,270,3246,712,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,27769,1009,2643,322,671,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,2204,327,29899,29883,482,29549,29899,1270,1159,322,1539,12451,943,4852,2749,4600,966,564,29890,465,1379,29871,29953,564,16105,1159,304,3033,482,278,20026,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,29901,13,13,29896,29889,15183,537,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,508,367,263,2586,20871,470,286,25443,29892,3907,372,5189,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,29889,1152,1342,29892,297,278,1196,376,5268,29871,29896,29889,997,954,10651,311,707,6079,22819,1318,29892,3503,452,3435,5644,262,2331,1699,372,29915,29879,451,9186,2821,825,278,25657,338,5934,29889,13,29906,29889,7298,5084,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,10757,363,1009,16726,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,278,10379,310,1422,4072,310,29549,29899,1270,511,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18387,6455,470,16021,11898,304,2304,1009,2980,29889,13,29941,29889,4522,936,4972,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5900,508,367,263,2586,2898,304,1101,29892,10734,297,278,4004,988,896,5353,278,1422,4072,310,564,29890,465,1379,322,1009,9443,304,278,15600,29899,29941,29889,739,723,367,8444,565,896,1033,3867,901,3030,470,4511,573,260,15118,1546,1009,7014,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,9004,1078,777,19911,297,773,364,9188,272,936,9224,322,3386,292,385,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,297,4958,310,7542,537,322,10757,29889],"total_duration":65227844327,"load_duration":179141,"prompt_eval_count":292,"prompt_eval_duration":24424791000,"eval_count":329,"eval_duration":40802365000}
