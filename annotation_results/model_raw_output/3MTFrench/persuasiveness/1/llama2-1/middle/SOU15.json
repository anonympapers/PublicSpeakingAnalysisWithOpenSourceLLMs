The speaker presents some interesting and informative points about the development of the zebrafish brain, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker provides some fascinating observations about the development of the zebrafish brain, particularly the formation of the eyes and nasal cavity. However, the explanation of how the neurons in the nose migrate and connect with the brain could be more detailed and scientifically rigorous. The comparison of the neurons to a car on a broken terrain is an interesting analogy, but it could be further developed to provide a clearer picture of how these cells move and connect.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker mentions two hypotheses regarding the movement of the neurons, there is no clear conclusion drawn from these hypotheses. It would be more persuasive if the speaker provided more evidence and logical reasoning to support their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting information about zebrafish brain development, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and scientifically accurate.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,269,29915,342,544,4637,818,12471,29871,29896,8694,7907,425,282,9568,634,427,19342,424,1190,425,17949,316,301,29915,1117,29878,291,2535,454,20710,1883,4338,4191,1190,301,29915,3027,782,8442,29892,373,8164,8689,454,5147,345,585,1750,409,13942,29877,4798,2535,316,18402,21384,966,26809,1750,409,363,358,634,782,29899,19521,375,966,3105,1295,17655,1475,868,772,17387,29889,9353,425,17655,457,868,772,17387,503,30000,1030,29892,966,26808,2873,29892,6836,867,265,427,269,29915,29948,417,647,424,316,425,7101,868,5147,345,585,5646,427,599,265,479,424,589,9318,23778,427,301,29915,290,2634,29892,301,29915,1165,650,29892,23068,3479,339,1379,11797,409,4511,296,2535,966,3038,2540,868,5147,345,585,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,3027,439,29915,265,8164,8689,818,29262,29889,2664,26808,2873,29892,5646,4191,966,10890,3038,2540,29892,4625,553,8774,3068,1608,267,427,22024,3471,1750,6267,19172,296,316,29542,2872,634,270,29915,485,25856,1465,6267,12471,17239,29889,9353,454,3209,553,26808,2873,316,425,17655,457,29892,16671,29892,6701,28194,7015,8774,3068,1608,267,427,22024,3471,452,18165,29876,296,2331,29892,966,26808,2873,1029,273,1760,634,260,3906,6267,3158,1671,409,4511,261,2535,454,5147,345,585,29889,315,29915,342,443,7006,4191,1354,373,4880,1249,1597,992,17252,1190,443,28439,5644,262,29892,4555,454,286,866,332,707,274,465,29948,634,439,29915,265,425,12278,1249,18097,6701,1029,4564,29948,29889,1551,8164,8532,10420,261,818,4239,13752,2093,267,29892,12852,980,343,263,553,26943,1750,282,681,18616,425,992,17252,2123,8532,980,343,263,553,26943,1750,425,19493,296,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,322,1871,1230,3291,1048,278,5849,310,278,503,774,1929,728,17294,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,8128,777,21028,262,1218,13917,1048,278,5849,310,278,503,774,1929,728,17294,29892,10734,278,12409,310,278,5076,322,8281,284,18346,537,29889,2398,29892,278,8252,310,920,278,26808,787,297,278,26414,9725,403,322,4511,411,278,17294,1033,367,901,13173,322,16021,635,12912,20657,29889,450,10230,310,278,26808,787,304,263,1559,373,263,9391,28439,338,385,8031,3483,6933,29892,541,372,1033,367,4340,8906,304,3867,263,26135,7623,310,920,1438,9101,4337,322,4511,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,1023,13752,21523,11211,278,10298,310,278,26808,787,29892,727,338,694,2821,15997,12061,515,1438,13752,21523,29889,739,723,367,901,20408,294,573,565,278,25657,4944,901,10757,322,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,2472,1048,503,774,1929,728,17294,5849,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,16021,635,16232,29889],"total_duration":62330625847,"load_duration":163817,"prompt_eval_count":329,"prompt_eval_duration":30128242000,"eval_count":255,"eval_duration":32201817000}
