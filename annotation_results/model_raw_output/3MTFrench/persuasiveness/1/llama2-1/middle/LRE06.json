{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T14:35:34.368144118Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker presents several convincing arguments and examples to support their claim that waste can be converted into energy. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. Lack of concrete evidence: While the speaker mentions various methods for converting waste into energy, they do not provide any concrete evidence or data to support their claims. This lack of empirical evidence may make it difficult for the audience to fully trust the speaker's arguments.\n2. Vagueness: At times, the speaker's language is quite vague, making it challenging to understand exactly what they are trying to convey. For example, the phrase \"combien de méthodes nous pouvons produire avec tel ou tel déchets\" (how many methods can we produce with such and such waste) is not very specific or clear.\n3. Too much repetition: The speaker repeats certain phrases or ideas multiple times throughout the speech, which can make it feel repetitive and less engaging for the audience. For example, the phrase \"je travaille sur des expérimentations pour vous dire\" (I am working on experiments to tell you) is repeated several times, which could be condensed into a single mention.\n4. Lack of emotional connection: While the speaker's passion and enthusiasm for their work are evident, they do not establish an emotional connection with the audience in a meaningful way. The speech could benefit from more personal anecdotes or stories that illustrate the impact of waste conversion on real people or communities.\n\nOverall, while the speech presents some compelling arguments, it could benefit from more concrete evidence and a more engaging delivery to fully persuade the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,2257,15243,29892,553,3038,267,634,868,12642,29892,2535,27612,8556,24684,787,1391,533,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,4785,309,30001,29892,3440,432,29915,1794,2889,265,16100,1601,29140,818,4883,610,6544,29889,9353,7814,7446,29890,4999,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,7890,2257,712,301,29915,265,1671,8356,286,29915,1893,273,7608,29889,8748,6079,29892,2257,3435,9411,966,1437,305,1691,2894,3783,29892,2535,966,1791,1446,20196,7147,29892,2123,10440,966,7774,787,3669,453,743,1750,452,20423,2298,7848,1162,29891,695,743,29889,6803,12584,270,29915,1540,1178,1318,29892,16573,316,425,2730,26665,316,7814,7446,29890,4999,29892,1671,7848,1539,841,29884,29871,1654,29892,26842,404,424,302,29915,342,2331,3022,29878,23855,882,29889,2581,6427,8284,1190,553,1518,1064,2073,800,1671,7890,2970,29892,4145,819,316,8774,386,2631,8556,24684,787,1391,533,2535,13547,2123,13547,1437,305,1691,29889,1174,13495,29892,432,29915,20640,895,5278,5802,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,16623,29231,5495,4883,5703,743,818,425,10329,28123,29892,13547,878,15340,316,13618,29889,379,11279,368,29873,293,707,454,7017,818,29231,5495,29889,1174,13495,29892,6079,29892,818,269,29915,29891,270,29915,29877,30071,432,29915,29874,603,29892,7847,818,15093,288,29926,8146,634,427,4951,29892,1539,941,30058,276,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,3196,17953,3277,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,393,19863,508,367,11543,964,5864,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,18387,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,5164,3519,363,17415,19863,964,5864,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,10225,310,29190,936,10757,1122,1207,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,8072,9311,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,29889,13,29906,29889,478,351,3837,404,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4086,338,3755,25160,29892,3907,372,18066,292,304,2274,3721,825,896,526,1811,304,27769,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,16549,376,17743,819,316,8774,386,2631,8556,24684,787,1391,533,2535,13547,2123,13547,1437,305,1691,29908,313,3525,1784,3519,508,591,7738,411,1316,322,1316,19863,29897,338,451,1407,2702,470,2821,29889,13,29941,29889,1763,29877,1568,21159,654,29901,450,25657,5565,1446,3058,12216,2129,470,7014,2999,3064,10106,278,12032,29892,607,508,1207,372,4459,21159,3321,322,3109,3033,6751,363,278,20026,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,16549,376,1324,6427,8284,1190,553,1518,1064,2073,800,1671,7890,2970,29908,313,29902,626,1985,373,15729,304,2649,366,29897,338,10324,3196,3064,29892,607,1033,367,2148,21144,964,263,2323,3585,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,23023,1848,3957,29901,5806,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,23644,3173,29885,363,1009,664,526,13602,29892,896,437,451,10127,385,23023,1848,3957,411,278,20026,297,263,6593,1319,982,29889,450,12032,1033,14169,515,901,7333,385,687,29881,4769,470,15874,393,28475,278,10879,310,19863,11301,373,1855,2305,470,23507,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,22981,777,752,7807,6273,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,18387,10757,322,263,901,3033,6751,28289,304,8072,20408,1943,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":74874732053,"load_duration":152154,"prompt_eval_count":258,"prompt_eval_duration":24420878000,"eval_count":390,"eval_duration":50453193000}
