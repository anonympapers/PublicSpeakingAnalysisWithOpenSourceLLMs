{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T02:12:20.701702879Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker does a good job of highlighting the importance of monitoring crevette health and the potential dangers of pollutants on their well-being. They also provide some interesting examples of how their work as a cyberdoctor can help detect diseases in humans, such as diabetes. However, the speech could benefit from more concrete evidence and statistics to support the speaker's claims. For example, they could provide data on the prevalence of pollutants in crevette habitats or the impact of pollution on their health.\n\nRigor of reasoning: The speaker's use of analogies and metaphors to explain their work is effective in making it accessible to a general audience. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker's assertion that \"the technique of dosage of these biomarcheurs [gives] us an emprunte, enfin une, plus t√¥t des milliers\" could be further clarified or supported with evidence. Additionally, the comparison of the crevette's genetic database to a police crime scene investigation could be more detailed and nuanced.\n\nOverall, while the speech shows promise in terms of persuasiveness and reasoning, it could benefit from more concrete evidence and rigorous thinking to make its arguments even stronger.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,270,29915,497,814,267,29892,274,29915,342,1661,2331,1597,8825,298,3409,9061,29892,3503,425,20877,29948,316,24145,907,29894,2353,1750,2947,409,1437,629,1664,427,29845,316,1248,6092,1934,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,712,1601,18848,316,5094,495,1867,312,5411,24108,29889,6803,1437,371,312,261,553,4439,328,583,14255,301,29915,21708,29892,454,652,370,12973,610,17488,29892,373,2947,3248,261,553,6062,29948,21337,316,480,1037,29889,678,1759,425,907,29894,2353,29892,1444,325,1759,3248,261,10741,6062,29948,21337,29892,3503,5697,1169,5152,1080,818,7006,966,4768,290,279,1173,1295,1750,325,609,592,19172,276,316,17043,13639,1487,2852,271,316,20877,29948,29892,634,12866,316,4048,6390,1354,4875,263,4370,427,29845,316,1248,6092,1934,29889,997,11043,316,3248,482,316,7015,4768,290,279,1173,1295,8556,285,2905,277,1597,29835,270,29915,331,558,17316,29892,427,4951,1597,29892,2298,260,9373,553,3533,4285,29889,8748,1671,19397,1006,558,26283,7015,953,1457,524,267,29892,1444,16623,4191,425,10974,29892,1444,966,7252,818,1597,2967,316,21880,29889,8748,1465,24145,3209,29892,7015,21880,29892,274,29915,342,454,22191,26052,6094,19971,316,425,907,29894,2353,29892,2257,27965,1314,11033,29940,29889,951,4224,19177,29890,941,29926,316,425,360,29940,27666,553,14746,316,19313,712,1444,19760,2894,7608,1671,9484,261,611,2967,316,21880,29889,8649,4285,29892,14746,29892,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,12141,292,278,13500,310,29652,907,29894,2353,9045,322,278,7037,270,13873,310,21180,329,1934,373,1009,1532,29899,915,292,29889,2688,884,3867,777,8031,6455,310,920,1009,664,408,263,5094,495,1867,2801,508,1371,6459,10267,2129,297,25618,29892,1316,408,652,370,10778,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,1033,14169,515,901,18387,10757,322,13964,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,3867,848,373,278,758,791,663,310,21180,329,1934,297,907,29894,2353,4760,1446,470,278,10879,310,21180,918,373,1009,9045,29889,13,13,29934,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,671,310,15690,583,322,1539,12451,943,304,5649,1009,664,338,11828,297,3907,372,15579,304,263,2498,20026,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,376,1552,11043,310,3248,482,310,1438,4768,290,279,1173,1295,518,29887,3145,29962,502,385,953,558,17316,29892,427,4951,1597,29892,2298,260,9373,553,3533,4285,29908,1033,367,4340,7542,2164,470,6969,411,10757,29889,19814,29892,278,10230,310,278,907,29894,2353,29915,29879,2531,7492,2566,304,263,10974,17268,9088,22522,1033,367,901,13173,322,4948,8362,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,3697,11640,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,24481,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,18387,10757,322,12912,20657,7291,304,1207,967,6273,1584,23505,29889],"total_duration":67677591010,"load_duration":161439,"prompt_eval_count":285,"prompt_eval_duration":25672277000,"eval_count":331,"eval_duration":42004735000}
