{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T14:38:49.925094646Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would score the speech as a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker uses some persuasive language and arguments to make their case, but there are also some flaws in their reasoning and delivery that detract from their overall effectiveness.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of vivid imagery and metaphors to paint a picture of the problem they are trying to address. For example, the speaker uses the image of a \"maamey soleil\" and \"un maamey du cl√©aire\" to convey the idea that the sun and sky can be unpredictable and changeable. This helps to engage the audience and make their message more memorable.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, they rely on anecdotal evidence and personal experiences rather than data or empirical research to support their claims. Additionally, they make some generalizations and oversimplifications that could be challenged by opposing viewpoints.\n\nIn terms of delivery, the speaker's tone is generally enthusiastic and engaging, but there are some moments where they come across as a bit disorganized or unfocused. This can make it difficult for the audience to follow their train of thought and fully appreciate their message.\n\nOverall, while the speech shows some promise in terms of persuasiveness and imagery, there are also some areas where the speaker could improve in terms of rigorous reasoning and delivery.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,11948,20554,3435,9577,6316,7545,634,844,264,1760,818,2665,381,443,7006,286,585,1564,275,29889,1720,343,263,443,611,420,29891,868,1067,29948,5218,29892,3503,5291,408,15237,1236,332,712,301,29915,23641,21907,18332,260,29915,24516,359,1249,425,4377,29889,1720,343,263,443,611,420,29891,14419,309,29889,315,29915,342,818,7175,3666,261,29889,6340,707,4292,1387,634,6094,10799,1509,29889,11948,5695,443,7006,4439,455,1509,1559,4875,452,18332,18413,2257,712,5291,3911,263,9667,29948,29889,10043,9577,544,15819,1671,2894,7608,1597,26558,19384,2637,5614,457,634,6079,19601,29892,1444,26099,454,17887,5152,291,1750,2947,1835,643,443,6316,1314,611,603,29891,14419,309,634,5646,2970,712,5291,2906,3417,1261,3825,443,1462,12898,358,818,611,611,326,436,20342,1671,11062,26558,19384,29889,2581,26099,12866,8691,22085,9061,634,12694,2016,868,8774,386,356,316,7175,4924,1465,2257,301,29915,29948,944,29889,315,29915,342,9201,14954,29892,1444,286,29915,328,370,473,3712,347,29892,634,14255,1597,9577,6316,1924,15096,29892,1559,18916,29892,1750,343,7905,1487,18926,29892,435,309,2151,29892,330,10870,316,5646,425,1903,287,347,29892,454,14419,309,634,966,4948,1179,564,374,794,818,301,29915,2015,18162,29889,11948,1559,18916,29892,435,309,2151,302,29915,14386,325,336,2073,2331,5713,519,29889,6298,5646,435,309,2151,29892,818,4889,316,2329,261,454,14419,309,270,29915,300,1336,1387,29892,25921,610,2257,1506,30095,29880,3610,743,13805,29889,8748,1559,18916,29892,1506,5441,29889,435,29915,1794,623,3780,29871,4277,454,19666,29871,29900,316,425,7175,4924,29889,951,19666,29871,29896,707,623,598,29884,18097,553,1380,267,427,2779,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,3913,777,20408,294,573,4086,322,6273,304,1207,1009,1206,29892,541,727,526,884,777,17422,5652,297,1009,24481,322,28289,393,1439,1461,515,1009,12463,2779,20193,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,1539,12451,943,304,10675,263,7623,310,278,1108,896,526,1811,304,3211,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3913,278,1967,310,263,376,655,420,29891,14419,309,29908,322,376,348,611,420,29891,868,1067,29948,5218,29908,304,27769,278,2969,393,278,6575,322,14744,508,367,443,27711,519,322,1735,519,29889,910,6911,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,1009,2643,901,26959,519,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,19104,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,27482,3265,1135,848,470,29190,936,5925,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,19814,29892,896,1207,777,2498,17063,322,288,874,13699,8232,393,1033,367,18066,287,491,9209,292,1776,9748,29889,13,13,797,4958,310,28289,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,338,6892,23644,29875,6288,322,3033,6751,29892,541,727,526,777,19462,988,896,2041,4822,408,263,2586,766,6388,1891,470,29395,542,3880,29889,910,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,322,8072,11188,1009,2643,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,3697,777,11640,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,6382,708,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,297,4958,310,12912,20657,24481,322,28289,29889],"total_duration":74212573983,"load_duration":249352,"prompt_eval_count":333,"prompt_eval_duration":31589597000,"eval_count":333,"eval_duration":42622155000}
