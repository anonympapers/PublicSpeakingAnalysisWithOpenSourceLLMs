{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T08:11:22.529332596Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some rigorous reasoning and evidence to support their claims, but there are also some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of concrete examples and data to illustrate the problem of geyser eruptions. The speaker provides specific numbers and statistics to demonstrate the scale of the issue, which helps to make the problem more relatable and pressing for the audience. Additionally, the speaker's use of technical terms and jargon related to their field of expertise adds credibility and authority to their argument.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speech could be improved. For example, the speaker's claim that they have developed a new experimental method to study geysers in a way that is not possible with traditional methods could be more convincing if they provided more details about this method and how it differs from existing approaches. Additionally, the speaker could provide more context and background information on the topic of geysers and their significance, which would help to establish the speaker's expertise and credibility.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some strong points, there are also areas where the argument could be strengthened to make it more persuasive and convincing for the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,14344,553,772,790,787,29889,315,29915,342,7175,3476,15471,301,29915,711,4026,316,1601,18848,29889,6803,18402,10505,29892,1444,19760,7848,15390,316,285,2905,381,872,4323,2131,270,29915,29882,1064,296,661,2406,29889,317,29915,1131,8284,316,289,2540,11658,743,634,6267,1841,16707,427,18165,316,425,2600,13469,332,29889,317,29915,262,854,29884,270,29915,381,15749,29899,23088,29889,438,1481,29892,3503,454,25698,5000,707,316,260,8284,29892,1559,427,20552,307,309,707,9577,274,2131,29892,966,330,30000,5547,20423,6454,495,270,29915,1540,447,19072,316,2298,316,29871,29941,29900,2852,1179,29892,2535,443,1437,2966,5734,519,818,13704,868,337,264,2123,868,337,264,29889,853,878,15340,1841,700,277,427,10212,20141,452,14924,2331,270,29915,711,841,381,553,6896,19718,5713,519,29889,315,29915,342,1671,339,7768,980,263,5246,29899,29880,29915,29884,712,1444,1539,371,782,1298,425,2298,6815,1518,1064,2073,362,427,9122,1671,8689,454,10505,29892,872,521,1082,634,1487,27052,316,289,2540,427,1597,25642,10098,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,592,26099,818,439,29915,30001,443,610,3256,29892,1671,18729,29892,1444,592,26099,5075,1318,316,3949,6947,818,14857,1424,29948,3910,29889,435,29915,1794,16797,29948,443,1020,17334,3964,20372,1750,592,14924,427,5646,1298,316,425,521,1082,868,10505,29892,270,29915,711,841,381,1487,2852,271,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,18387,6455,322,848,304,28475,278,1108,310,330,1032,643,604,29884,1980,29889,450,25657,8128,2702,3694,322,13964,304,22222,278,6287,310,278,2228,29892,607,6911,304,1207,278,1108,901,1104,17219,322,24795,363,278,20026,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,16905,4958,322,432,1191,265,4475,304,1009,1746,310,17924,895,12778,6625,4127,322,14329,304,1009,2980,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,896,505,8906,263,716,17986,1158,304,6559,1737,952,414,297,263,982,393,338,451,1950,411,13807,3519,1033,367,901,17953,3277,565,896,4944,901,4902,1048,445,1158,322,920,372,2923,414,515,5923,13501,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,1737,952,414,322,1009,26002,29892,607,723,1371,304,10127,278,25657,29915,29879,17924,895,322,6625,4127,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,756,777,4549,3291,29892,727,526,884,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,322,17953,3277,363,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":61789418205,"load_duration":237123,"prompt_eval_count":275,"prompt_eval_duration":25290459000,"eval_count":290,"eval_duration":36498191000}
