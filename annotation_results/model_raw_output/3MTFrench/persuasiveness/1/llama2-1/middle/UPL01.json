{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T18:07:58.331317689Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker presents a clear and concise argument, highlighting the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping an individual's emotional development. However, the reasoning is not always rigorous, with some claims being based on anecdotal evidence or untested assumptions.\n\nThe speaker makes several valid points about the role of early childhood experiences in shaping emotional development, including the importance of secure attachment and the potential consequences of insecure attachment. However, some of the claims made are not backed up by empirical evidence or logical reasoning, which can detract from the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nFor example, the speaker claims that when the environment becomes secure, it is the \"truthful point of impact\" of a deep emotional desert. While this statement is intriguing, it is not clear what evidence supports this claim, or how it relates to the broader argument being made about early childhood experiences. Similarly, the speaker mentions the concept of \"agony primitif,\" but does not provide any explanation or support for this term beyond its use in the transcript.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and compelling argument about the importance of early childhood experiences, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to increase the persuasiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,427,11643,1189,434,14954,1173,1509,712,1444,592,364,1975,782,16573,316,7015,19117,1750,29892,443,8694,29892,4625,4191,980,1399,1654,519,29889,405,29915,29891,263,29899,29873,29899,309,2331,29892,2123,1970,1144,316,6267,298,6844,29892,966,25179,787,267,818,7814,5155,29892,992,309,30001,454,8442,316,611,266,17449,29892,16454,782,2752,316,19449,1750,966,633,1131,296,427,11172,4191,301,29915,17234,4799,29889,478,681,3669,854,6096,29899,23088,29892,274,29915,342,7017,17775,7209,269,4894,1808,29892,14931,29920,610,454,4880,316,26814,21428,29892,610,966,13137,316,26814,15732,29892,443,12471,17239,7019,2764,11728,29892,9378,275,10460,13220,1671,22010,4193,29892,9378,275,10460,1970,29875,424,1671,1518,1064,2073,261,29889,8748,6079,29892,28194,7015,19117,592,1153,3051,6267,7017,3669,15470,29892,1354,11797,452,3435,2331,454,15774,270,29915,348,5537,29892,11797,3435,1190,1597,6815,1559,663,6299,1166,744,29892,316,577,1144,29892,316,10331,23458,29892,270,29915,27419,3847,284,29892,1903,5218,29889,19551,802,301,29915,21813,17239,269,4582,545,15210,427,285,1908,29892,274,29915,342,454,27128,519,1298,270,29915,6574,627,270,29915,348,2600,898,1437,1940,6602,361,29889,365,29915,21813,17239,269,4582,545,15210,443,12471,17239,946,265,275,424,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,2245,1004,301,29915,351,2592,28147,361,29889,10016,3829,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2980,29892,12141,292,278,13500,310,4688,2278,6614,27482,297,528,21430,385,5375,29915,29879,23023,1848,5849,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,411,777,16726,1641,2729,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,470,443,1688,287,20813,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3732,3196,2854,3291,1048,278,6297,310,4688,2278,6614,27482,297,528,21430,23023,1848,5849,29892,3704,278,13500,310,11592,26305,322,278,7037,27721,310,297,24216,26305,29889,2398,29892,777,310,278,16726,1754,526,451,1250,287,701,491,29190,936,10757,470,16667,24481,29892,607,508,1439,1461,515,278,12463,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,16726,393,746,278,5177,7415,11592,29892,372,338,278,376,509,2806,1319,1298,310,10879,29908,310,263,6483,23023,1848,18197,29889,5806,445,3229,338,11158,5526,292,29892,372,338,451,2821,825,10757,11286,445,5995,29892,470,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,2545,1664,2980,1641,1754,1048,4688,2278,6614,27482,29889,20175,29892,278,25657,26649,278,6964,310,376,351,2592,28147,361,1699,541,947,451,3867,738,8252,470,2304,363,445,1840,8724,967,671,297,278,1301,924,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,752,7807,2980,1048,278,13500,310,4688,2278,6614,27482,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,7910,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":61028312631,"load_duration":8015994,"prompt_eval_count":277,"prompt_eval_duration":23157412000,"eval_count":307,"eval_duration":37862196000}
