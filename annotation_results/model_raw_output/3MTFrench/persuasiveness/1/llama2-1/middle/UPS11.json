{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T15:16:30.081681331Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some convincing arguments and uses rhetorical devices to make their point, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses repetition and emphasis to drive home their message, particularly in the opening lines of the transcript. By repeating the phrase \"plus rien ne peut empêcher,\" they create a sense of inevitability and urgency around the topic of cancer. The use of vivid imagery, such as \"les solumitantes d'assouvir leur plus noir des ailes,\" also helps to make the message more impactful.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a claim that the immune system is not able to keep up with the speed at which cancer cells mutate and multiply. While this is a valid concern, it would be more persuasive if backed by scientific evidence or data. Additionally, the speaker's use of hyperbole, such as \"des tenues de camonflages\" and \"invisible aux yeux du système immunitaire,\" can be seen as exaggerated and may not be taken seriously by the audience.\n\nOverall, while the speech is effective in raising awareness about the potential threat of cancer, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous to make the message more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2298,21181,452,8164,3710,30037,4630,966,899,398,277,3794,270,29915,465,283,2405,6267,2298,694,381,553,263,5475,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,29892,282,5495,966,18475,2863,18254,768,3145,29892,409,6674,4926,29892,8104,7608,634,8829,801,381,966,2894,267,1671,4642,553,508,22543,29889,8748,20554,452,269,29915,331,558,347,296,2331,29892,1559,4439,28661,22527,29892,443,1559,553,18554,29871,1654,5814,5326,2947,13942,29877,2496,443,23900,29889,8748,25763,20554,29892,1597,1190,4239,263,2002,553,5478,800,316,282,743,262,12150,307,29889,11948,712,5246,454,21423,5198,348,9407,1465,301,29915,13624,29892,302,29915,18441,2331,19343,1318,2453,5495,1190,8556,29889,1174,5246,29892,980,454,5246,29892,18402,14426,7209,439,29915,265,8556,7697,16731,29892,980,521,5793,29892,5702,634,1437,509,3121,966,3038,2540,23900,6394,29889,323,29915,267,1597,27128,519,16987,427,5335,329,424,29889,11948,980,26030,6079,3008,28230,270,29915,348,17887,17103,316,19957,29889,1704,966,3038,2540,5478,3794,966,2298,286,2520,296,16797,296,553,2428,19397,29879,316,6896,21558,29889,11001,267,1539,29873,296,553,2656,267,316,330,309,634,610,5521,29892,553,3006,1041,316,3949,265,1579,1179,634,2906,23510,443,17912,1821,634,27597,3479,26809,868,21423,5198,348,9407,29889,11948,3440,13942,29877,2496,20554,29892,274,29915,342,2428,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,17583,3913,21159,654,322,19310,275,304,7899,3271,1009,2643,29892,10734,297,278,8718,3454,310,278,1301,924,29889,2648,28769,278,16549,376,11242,21181,452,8164,3710,30037,4630,1699,896,1653,263,4060,310,297,5750,277,3097,322,5065,14703,2820,278,11261,310,23900,29889,450,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,29892,1316,408,376,793,899,398,277,3794,270,29915,465,283,2405,6267,2298,694,381,553,263,5475,1699,884,6911,304,1207,278,2643,901,10879,1319,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,393,278,5198,1540,1788,338,451,2221,304,3013,701,411,278,6210,472,607,23900,9101,5478,403,322,22932,29889,5806,445,338,263,2854,5932,29892,372,723,367,901,20408,294,573,565,1250,287,491,16021,10757,470,848,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,29892,1316,408,376,2783,3006,1041,316,3949,265,1579,1179,29908,322,376,262,12872,3479,26809,868,21423,5198,348,9407,1699,508,367,3595,408,429,9921,630,322,1122,451,367,4586,25798,491,278,20026,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,11828,297,29263,3773,8326,404,1048,278,7037,28469,310,23900,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,304,1207,278,2643,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":65278058042,"load_duration":147794,"prompt_eval_count":271,"prompt_eval_duration":24338236000,"eval_count":325,"eval_duration":40939194000}
