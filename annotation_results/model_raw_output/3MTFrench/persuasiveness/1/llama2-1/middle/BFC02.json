{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T13:36:18.545721578Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker effectively presents their argument and provides examples to support their claim that discrimination exists in the job market. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. Lack of concrete evidence: While the speaker provides some examples of discrimination, they could benefit from presenting more concrete data or studies to support their claims. This would help to build a stronger argument and increase the persuasiveness of the speech.\n2. Overreliance on anecdotal evidence: The speaker relies heavily on personal experiences and anecdotes to make their point, which may not be as persuasive as using empirical data or scientific studies. A more rigorous approach would involve analyzing larger trends and patterns in the job market to support the claim of discrimination.\n3. Lack of a clear call to action: The speaker does not provide a clear call to action for the audience to take after listening to the speech. This could be improved by providing specific steps that listeners can take to combat discrimination in the job market.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a compelling argument, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the persuasiveness of the speech could be increased.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,1671,29873,424,29892,1444,452,26099,2331,5374,1189,434,29892,1444,452,26099,2331,11643,1189,434,29892,1661,19601,1444,26099,23837,2488,29889,11948,301,29915,29948,4599,347,29892,7890,454,4078,29920,9577,6079,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,712,425,1436,749,29892,425,1439,371,29892,425,2181,895,29892,4326,1617,29892,5646,29871,4277,5646,29871,4277,29889,10050,29889,365,29915,29948,4599,347,29892,274,29915,524,29948,23458,5695,818,425,1139,553,2313,20386,800,1559,980,302,29915,342,2331,6366,815,23837,8105,882,712,553,4348,375,577,993,2313,20386,743,29892,1436,19047,610,7848,1480,29948,818,425,13943,561,4745,316,425,8441,634,707,2298,316,5189,743,818,409,7697,276,1190,6267,13003,316,29231,5495,29889,26383,2257,1134,270,29915,1893,1151,12866,29892,373,263,1354,2298,7697,29884,16731,712,29892,19601,29899,18202,29892,925,29872,818,4556,316,1487,544,1690,290,29892,7905,4239,10098,11387,316,8825,270,29915,711,841,381,1597,1841,1713,712,19748,29889,438,29884,10440,712,25458,347,6303,425,2298,18484,3060,10770,25763,7015,7732,4348,375,29892,3503,5646,1326,993,5278,12694,663,316,1020,17334,29889,1551,707,5246,1671,16455,643,1671,946,381,1671,28640,276,425,2313,5632,3381,634,301,29915,18704,269,29915,404,5218,1465,17043,13639,966,9946,29889,6101,7890,1437,8204,29920,316,3060,275,381,25458,347,610,17488,29892,707,29899,346,712,18729,2453,329,2970,712,7890,29871,22730,7916,2488,818,966,7171,311,19748,2123,11021,2488,818,966,7171,311,782,17478,29899,29885,14785,1577,382,29882,6079,1661,29892,2331,363,29883,15471,29892,7890,9577,6079,1437,8204,29920,316,3060,275,381,25458,347,1559,7890,16133,25138,712,966,285,790,787,2298,270,29915,26917,316,1970,8837,712,966,7171,30019,787,634,373,8164,2331,325,336,2073,7890,27516,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,22981,1009,2980,322,8128,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,393,2313,5632,3381,4864,297,278,4982,9999,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,18387,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,6455,310,2313,5632,3381,29892,896,1033,14169,515,2198,292,901,18387,848,470,11898,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,723,1371,304,2048,263,23505,2980,322,7910,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,13,29906,29889,6811,276,13036,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,29901,450,25657,337,3687,20365,373,7333,27482,322,385,687,29881,4769,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,607,1122,451,367,408,20408,294,573,408,773,29190,936,848,470,16021,11898,29889,319,901,12912,20657,2948,723,25135,29537,292,7200,534,1975,322,15038,297,278,4982,9999,304,2304,278,5995,310,2313,5632,3381,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,263,2821,1246,304,3158,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,1246,304,3158,363,278,20026,304,2125,1156,19866,304,278,12032,29889,910,1033,367,16710,491,13138,2702,6576,393,11621,414,508,2125,304,15499,2313,5632,3381,297,278,4982,9999,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,752,7807,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,1033,367,11664,29889],"total_duration":68853503245,"load_duration":152210,"prompt_eval_count":355,"prompt_eval_duration":32084765000,"eval_count":291,"eval_duration":36768170000}
