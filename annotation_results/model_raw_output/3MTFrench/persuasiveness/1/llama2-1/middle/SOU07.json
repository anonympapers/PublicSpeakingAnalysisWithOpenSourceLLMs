{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T06:19:25.370084267Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker is making an argument for the need to detect intellectual disabilities earlier through biomarkers found in blood, but their reasoning is not entirely rigorous.\n\nThe speaker's main point is that current intelligence tests are not sufficient for young children, and that genetic tests could be a better option. However, they do not provide enough evidence to support this claim. They mention that the mutation of one gene can cause intellectual disability, but they do not explain how this works or what specific genes might be responsible. Additionally, they fail to address potential ethical concerns surrounding the use of genetic tests for intelligence purposes.\n\nThe speaker's delivery is clear and concise, but they could benefit from providing more context and evidence to support their argument. They also could have addressed potential counterarguments and criticisms of their position. Overall, while the speaker has a valid concern regarding the lack of adequate testing for intellectual disabilities in young children, their argument could be improved with more thorough research and logical reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,21668,9073,553,6987,13052,2063,29892,553,5697,3246,3408,29879,316,15358,29889,11948,373,452,8164,2331,1261,3825,443,12377,424,316,7732,6063,316,9073,553,3408,29879,316,15358,29889,838,943,29892,782,5246,29892,553,6987,6094,1893,3783,29889,11948,966,6987,6094,1893,3783,29892,5646,2257,439,29915,309,452,6309,29892,274,29915,342,29892,980,343,263,29892,782,2331,29892,1597,5478,362,439,29915,309,2117,598,29889,1720,452,766,2331,1354,5278,5478,362,4556,425,4439,328,347,29889,897,2298,29892,980,1302,30095,371,14954,29889,9353,611,17949,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,925,882,443,3209,29883,572,22781,316,553,285,6847,18715,29884,4999,29889,997,5478,362,270,29915,348,6063,29892,14344,29899,1885,29892,9378,277,1671,3269,261,5278,4439,328,347,1750,11943,1173,966,17137,634,1750,269,29915,932,1808,11482,1654,663,18715,13498,1661,22898,456,1387,29889,10050,22898,456,1387,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,712,966,25828,30069,4467,20423,564,3511,1465,16500,818,301,29915,18288,29892,2257,1750,707,7697,29884,454,652,21780,2923,25123,29889,951,1298,3817,18062,439,29915,2719,4625,9411,553,11101,7719,18715,29884,4999,3964,8675,2406,29892,11797,4625,868,4439,2535,553,260,30057,6609,316,425,6316,316,9411,966,16283,29892,4191,22272,634,9484,261,818,301,29915,1466,5246,409,9073,3999,21888,782,2320,13186,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,9297,347,316,534,8885,553,4768,290,5666,1295,1465,6267,13625,1671,1437,371,312,261,425,4439,328,347,2298,260,9373,1671,6628,1314,10259,18303,966,4439,3076,8288,712,6267,410,1173,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,338,3907,385,2980,363,278,817,304,6459,29762,766,11614,8859,1549,4768,290,935,414,1476,297,10416,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,9186,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,1667,1298,338,393,1857,21082,6987,526,451,8002,363,4123,4344,29892,322,393,2531,7492,6987,1033,367,263,2253,2984,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,2688,3585,393,278,5478,362,310,697,18530,508,4556,29762,766,3097,29892,541,896,437,451,5649,920,445,1736,470,825,2702,2531,267,1795,367,14040,29889,19814,29892,896,4418,304,3211,7037,11314,936,21838,18830,278,671,310,2531,7492,6987,363,21082,11976,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,28289,338,2821,322,3022,895,29892,541,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29889,2688,884,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,322,11164,12903,310,1009,2602,29889,6811,497,29892,1550,278,25657,756,263,2854,5932,11211,278,10225,310,19967,339,403,6724,363,29762,766,11614,297,4123,4344,29892,1009,2980,1033,367,16710,411,901,17826,5925,322,16667,24481,29889],"total_duration":58837657861,"load_duration":171153,"prompt_eval_count":314,"prompt_eval_duration":28541322000,"eval_count":241,"eval_duration":30295662000}
