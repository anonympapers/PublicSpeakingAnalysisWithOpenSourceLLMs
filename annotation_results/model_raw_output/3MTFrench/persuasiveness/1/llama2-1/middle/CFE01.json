{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T16:28:30.475747245Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and examples to support their claims, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. Here are some specific points:\n\n* The speaker provides some interesting insights into the differences between human and robot behavior and the potential benefits of studying these differences. However, they do not provide a clear thesis statement or central argument to guide the rest of the speech. This makes it harder for the listener to follow the speaker's train of thought and understand the main point of the speech.\n* The speaker uses some technical terms and concepts related to robotics and user experience, but does not always provide clear explanations or examples to help the listener understand these terms. This can make the speech feel somewhat impenetrable at times.\n* The speaker mentions several different types of profiles that they are studying, but does not provide enough context or explanation to help the listener understand what these profiles are or why they are important. This makes it difficult for the listener to follow the speaker's train of thought and see the relevance of their research.\n* The speaker mentions the potential for robots to learn from humans and adapt to different situations, but does not provide enough examples or evidence to support this claim. This can make the speech feel somewhat speculative or unproven.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas and insights, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the presentation could be more clear and concise.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,1190,5278,11101,2131,712,14931,1601,29140,316,266,17449,29889,461,13304,454,20299,882,270,29915,348,19964,2123,25732,663,11101,2131,634,8829,347,270,29915,1540,26744,29973,461,9073,18729,1577,1459,346,712,1437,4951,381,1597,25732,663,553,22268,2993,274,29915,342,868,22916,29889,838,943,1671,4880,261,4239,29892,13745,9102,283,312,13498,29892,29871,4277,2947,7848,10440,2298,1411,29889,1459,8474,29892,4048,6390,1354,7890,29871,22730,4082,275,2123,1661,2535,966,26957,5722,11763,29892,29871,4277,29892,454,19964,8164,454,9073,29889,6803,18729,29892,980,7890,14111,427,7890,5734,264,818,553,20077,29879,818,301,29915,264,868,13222,316,8714,29892,818,301,29915,4548,4894,663,29892,3025,553,12266,1295,439,29915,1808,13949,371,1513,882,3911,29899,18202,427,409,2362,424,1190,7015,2117,371,1295,29889,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,1190,5278,8861,8691,712,1444,6427,8284,1044,27751,29892,2123,818,8019,270,29915,348,9451,868,22700,7289,316,10832,1862,10252,1934,29892,432,29915,9297,347,270,29915,25378,7015,12694,1237,20077,29879,29889,10016,10098,966,20077,29879,1437,4951,583,29892,373,2947,6003,381,966,619,261,782,1134,316,15284,689,29872,29892,10426,2123,1661,29892,818,6267,18165,20809,2131,2298,2123,11387,28273,267,29889,6803,712,18729,844,7081,11062,425,26744,29892,3503,5695,29892,18097,269,943,29892,980,12852,966,15378,1973,634,5374,29948,1066,13876,29889,1551,1671,8356,409,2970,712,18729,25921,29892,3503,452,2331,868,5646,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,2266,526,777,2702,3291,29901,13,13,29930,450,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,12651,1546,5199,322,19964,6030,322,278,7037,23633,310,23382,1438,12651,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,2821,266,6656,3229,470,6555,2980,304,10754,278,1791,310,278,12032,29889,910,3732,372,22622,363,278,13254,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,322,2274,278,1667,1298,310,278,12032,29889,13,29930,450,25657,3913,777,16905,4958,322,22001,4475,304,19964,1199,322,1404,7271,29892,541,947,451,2337,3867,2821,7309,800,470,6455,304,1371,278,13254,2274,1438,4958,29889,910,508,1207,278,12032,4459,10579,527,2238,300,18104,472,3064,29889,13,29930,450,25657,26649,3196,1422,4072,310,28723,393,896,526,23382,29892,541,947,451,3867,3307,3030,470,8252,304,1371,278,13254,2274,825,1438,28723,526,470,2020,896,526,4100,29889,910,3732,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,322,1074,278,29527,749,310,1009,5925,29889,13,29930,450,25657,26649,278,7037,363,10832,1862,304,5110,515,25618,322,7744,304,1422,18845,29892,541,947,451,3867,3307,6455,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,910,508,1207,278,12032,4459,10579,1580,28524,470,443,771,854,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,1663,5861,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,24329,1033,367,901,2821,322,3022,895,29889],"total_duration":65836713739,"load_duration":267023,"prompt_eval_count":294,"prompt_eval_duration":24709600000,"eval_count":335,"eval_duration":41126313000}
