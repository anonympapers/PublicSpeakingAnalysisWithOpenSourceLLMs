{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T06:22:49.296387309Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker presents an interesting and unique approach to cultivating liver cells in vitro, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claim that the current method of cultivating liver cells is not sufficient. While they mention that the cells are \"sometimes\" used after a few years of being in culture, they do not provide any data or research to back up this statement. Additionally, they do not address potential counterarguments or alternative approaches that may be more effective.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker presents an innovative solution by using a micro-fiducial platform, they do not fully explain how this platform would work or how it would mimic the liver's natural environment. They mention that the platform is made of silicon and is transparent, but they do not provide any details on its surface texture, porosity, or how it would regulate the temperature and nutrient supply to the cells.\n\nLastly, while the speaker acknowledges the limitations of their approach by stating that it is \"inabituel\" for an architect to design a habitat for liver cells, they do not fully address the ethical considerations of using living cells in a controlled environment. They mention that they would be \"humble\" the interior of the puck with an alginate gel, but they do not provide any thoughts on the potential risks or consequences of this approach.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents an intriguing idea for cultivating liver cells in vitro, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened by providing more evidence and detailing the specifics of their proposed solution.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1671,4185,2147,7015,3038,2540,868,1701,347,1465,553,5855,2298,410,6609,316,3038,267,316,14913,29899,29885,2708,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,373,1671,8356,2970,712,1444,26099,427,21907,29835,1597,6956,29872,270,29915,524,14508,1750,14954,1173,818,1035,434,453,381,7015,3038,2540,1465,443,13164,1480,882,297,13901,307,1750,6267,7602,993,316,1841,29885,434,1314,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,1444,19760,17043,13639,10713,3503,787,270,29915,17234,29889,1720,269,23071,7890,818,439,7768,18475,6967,454,26814,1701,347,1597,904,1112,479,330,1191,1318,316,13625,29889,438,1481,29892,274,29915,342,443,15744,297,370,1981,295,1671,443,6956,29872,29892,3503,1444,1104,15792,454,1437,7241,29889,4785,1654,1601,15744,29889,2581,610,29879,868,1480,882,316,2967,29892,22700,743,8997,13545,8595,20737,29892,425,2653,346,29889,10043,270,29915,6574,575,339,1379,2653,346,29892,425,2653,346,29892,9200,29899,29888,333,1387,29889,1174,4047,293,650,1301,862,2016,29892,2331,14954,29892,7101,4760,519,29892,29871,29896,29892,29945,7477,1559,5606,29892,782,29899,29873,487,5898,2174,29888,898,29892,29871,29900,29892,29906,5654,29889,5791,1298,29899,3921,29892,3041,29884,680,425,29370,1671,527,1524,425,18342,362,269,2375,457,29889,478,993,18158,611,11943,1173,15001,1808,29889,2581,592,3165,569,301,29915,524,14508,316,5278,2653,346,270,29915,348,14783,468,295,270,29915,2499,5359,403,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,385,8031,322,5412,2948,304,18834,1218,619,369,9101,297,13901,307,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,1857,1158,310,18834,1218,619,369,9101,338,451,8002,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,9101,526,376,29879,14618,29908,1304,1156,263,2846,2440,310,1641,297,9257,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,848,470,5925,304,1250,701,445,3229,29889,19814,29892,896,437,451,3211,7037,6795,25699,470,8671,13501,393,1122,367,901,11828,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,385,24233,1230,1650,491,773,263,9200,29899,29888,333,29884,1455,7481,29892,896,437,451,8072,5649,920,445,7481,723,664,470,920,372,723,286,326,293,278,619,369,29915,29879,5613,5177,29889,2688,3585,393,278,7481,338,1754,310,4047,4144,322,338,17772,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,373,967,7101,18459,29892,1277,359,537,29892,470,920,372,723,1072,5987,278,10430,322,18254,374,296,11421,304,278,9101,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,1550,278,25657,24084,2710,278,27028,310,1009,2948,491,23659,393,372,338,376,262,370,1981,295,29908,363,385,6956,304,2874,263,17570,363,619,369,9101,29892,896,437,451,8072,3211,278,11314,936,2050,800,310,773,8471,9101,297,263,20704,5177,29889,2688,3585,393,896,723,367,376,29882,15563,29908,278,13290,310,278,2653,384,411,385,3093,16976,9127,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,13133,373,278,7037,5161,2039,470,27721,310,445,2948,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,385,11158,5526,292,2969,363,18834,1218,619,369,9101,297,13901,307,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,10757,322,9493,292,278,2702,29879,310,1009,7972,1650,29889],"total_duration":76536492210,"load_duration":240687,"prompt_eval_count":279,"prompt_eval_duration":25590980000,"eval_count":391,"eval_duration":50944708000}
