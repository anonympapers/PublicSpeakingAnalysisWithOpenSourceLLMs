The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"But how does it work exactly? When we breathe in, the molecules of chemicals present in the air around us go directly into our noses\") and emphasis on key points (\"So, our nose can detect more than 1000 billion different smells\") to make their argument convincing. The speaker also uses a relatable analogy (\"Imagine if we had only 350 colors like our eyes can see, or 3 million tones like our ears can hear\") to help the audience understand the vastness of the olfactory world.\n\nHowever, there is one area where the speech could be improved: the conclusion. While the speaker provides some interesting facts about the number of smells the nose can detect, they do not provide a clear call to action or a summary of their main point. A more conclusive statement, such as \"So, the next time you catch a whiff of your favorite fragrance, remember how incredibly powerful and capable your sense of smell is,\" could help drive home the speaker's message and leave a lasting impression on the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,966,288,311,1295,946,19047,1190,24145,5147,345,585,634,1597,9580,545,868,2174,275,381,29889,11948,29892,3440,29871,4277,1766,1173,925,29872,454,2258,428,1577,19551,802,301,29915,265,8681,533,29892,966,6062,29948,21337,20674,3783,782,9579,4182,1750,3435,5814,5326,443,7006,760,449,1465,301,29915,1466,26269,316,8556,325,609,9577,270,29915,264,24145,5273,29889,8748,10042,2257,2329,261,29892,782,19666,316,7814,1841,13300,371,1295,394,17028,10270,29889,7747,3435,7015,1841,13300,371,1295,439,29915,264,24722,18158,1513,882,301,29915,19678,818,24145,5147,345,585,29889,405,681,1029,787,12471,29871,29941,29945,29900,1841,13300,371,1295,394,17028,10270,29889,1720,343,263,818,5246,712,7015,29871,29941,29945,29900,1841,13300,371,1295,553,9638,361,3783,4625,3408,29948,712,24145,452,29920,409,1841,5030,403,316,1437,371,312,261,2298,316,29871,29896,29900,29900,29900,3533,29875,3163,270,29915,29874,1082,1295,28374,29889,1105,277,29871,29896,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,10098,2298,712,454,5419,316,3581,280,1295,712,7814,26809,3435,2117,1849,316,1437,371,312,261,634,29871,29941,14746,316,10098,2298,712,454,5419,316,260,7177,2131,712,7814,28074,7545,3435,2117,1849,316,1320,292,2853,29889,11948,782,6299,29892,28194,301,29915,265,2665,1597,288,311,332,29892,373,263,443,17887,7006,316,302,284,818,1539,2484,427,875,434,29889,8748,1436,6311,29892,24145,8861,1841,2467,2947,23422,7848,316,2970,1354,373,263,603,29892,2123,1354,373,263,603,2331,5278,288,311,332,29889,478,681,29892,2123,1661,29892,5246,289,9854,1354,1444,7890,18332,443,17422,535,1750,640,993,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,4852,6246,920,947,372,664,3721,29973,1932,591,2078,271,354,297,29892,278,13206,21337,310,22233,29879,2198,297,278,4799,2820,502,748,4153,964,1749,7814,267,1159,322,19310,275,373,1820,3291,4852,6295,29892,1749,26414,508,6459,901,1135,29871,29896,29900,29900,29900,24464,1422,1560,10071,1159,304,1207,1009,2980,17953,3277,29889,450,25657,884,3913,263,1104,17219,3483,6933,4852,1888,22094,565,591,750,871,29871,29941,29945,29900,11955,763,1749,5076,508,1074,29892,470,29871,29941,7284,260,2873,763,1749,22827,508,8293,1159,304,1371,278,20026,2274,278,13426,2264,310,278,13386,14399,3186,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,338,697,4038,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29901,278,15997,29889,5806,278,25657,8128,777,8031,17099,1048,278,1353,310,1560,10071,278,26414,508,6459,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,2821,1246,304,3158,470,263,15837,310,1009,1667,1298,29889,319,901,21204,573,3229,29892,1316,408,376,6295,29892,278,2446,931,366,4380,263,377,2593,310,596,25448,5227,629,749,29892,6456,920,29811,14981,13988,322,15390,596,4060,310,1560,514,338,1699,1033,1371,7899,3271,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,322,5967,263,1833,292,17188,373,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":66311749707,"load_duration":263412,"prompt_eval_count":324,"prompt_eval_duration":29889598000,"eval_count":275,"eval_duration":36419289000}
