{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T13:31:38.378997379Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. The speaker presents several arguments and examples to support their claim that the current legal system in Europe is flawed and leads to inconsistent treatment of citizens. However, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened:\n\n1. Lack of clear evidence: While the speaker provides some examples of inconsistent treatment of citizens, they do not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. More specific examples and data would be needed to convince the audience of the scope of the problem.\n2. Limited scope: The speaker focuses primarily on the legal system in Europe, but does not consider other factors that could contribute to inconsistent treatment of citizens. For example, they do not address economic or cultural factors that could influence the application of laws.\n3. Lack of clear solutions: While the speaker proposes a solution of creating an acte unique, they do not provide sufficient details on how this would work in practice. More specific proposals and cost-benefit analyses would be needed to convince the audience of the feasibility and effectiveness of such a solution.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some valid points about the limitations of the current legal system, they could benefit from providing more evidence and considering a broader range of factors that contribute to inconsistent treatment of citizens.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,610,346,439,29915,309,452,3928,2331,818,872,26138,24228,29889,1174,1047,1004,29892,1465,2257,9744,29892,325,359,4441,1169,724,609,11113,375,29889,478,681,302,29915,735,1531,1249,2298,11099,333,8105,882,29889,405,29915,296,5705,8284,1136,2488,818,2852,566,631,7015,28374,18845,634,3686,388,6096,316,17124,4630,1597,2284,9874,29311,3381,553,27264,793,316,4441,1169,29889,6803,10019,1524,29892,818,18080,6502,29892,15182,29948,427,3444,29892,425,285,1829,1509,29892,4883,263,794,1973,29892,316,316,15470,18080,5334,29925,609,29892,25074,29883,1318,427,838,18453,29889,1174,11172,712,11099,2488,29892,432,29915,1794,553,714,2719,818,611,27963,29889,2726,13064,1080,6121,267,29892,966,27264,944,29879,17611,575,29892,966,1020,7719,29892,966,1437,3476,1080,270,29915,5753,2470,316,15426,316,301,29915,19986,29211,29892,966,22114,3420,267,316,425,6325,29211,29892,553,4441,1169,316,301,29915,21708,29889,6298,966,339,4999,29892,1444,286,29915,932,29884,347,1671,7175,2974,966,4441,1169,868,274,2049,11771,17611,264,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,1444,16193,6701,1597,1650,13149,744,29889,6803,339,7768,452,2331,9484,261,443,1044,29872,5412,29973,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,3196,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,1857,11706,1788,297,4092,338,17422,8734,322,11981,304,22435,9696,14502,310,18363,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,6455,310,22435,9696,14502,310,18363,29892,896,437,451,3867,8002,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5853,2702,6455,322,848,723,367,4312,304,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,6874,310,278,1108,29889,13,29906,29889,28873,6874,29901,450,25657,8569,267,19434,373,278,11706,1788,297,4092,29892,541,947,451,2050,916,13879,393,1033,29126,304,22435,9696,14502,310,18363,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,437,451,3211,17407,470,16375,13879,393,1033,9949,278,2280,310,14243,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,2821,6851,29901,5806,278,25657,9551,267,263,1650,310,4969,385,1044,29872,5412,29892,896,437,451,3867,8002,4902,373,920,445,723,664,297,6944,29889,5853,2702,9551,1338,322,3438,29899,1785,1389,277,3483,952,267,723,367,4312,304,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,28326,4127,322,2779,20193,310,1316,263,1650,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,27028,310,278,1857,11706,1788,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,10757,322,13858,263,2545,1664,3464,310,13879,393,29126,304,22435,9696,14502,310,18363,29889],"total_duration":59817987763,"load_duration":247084,"prompt_eval_count":235,"prompt_eval_duration":21028500000,"eval_count":306,"eval_duration":38788744000}
