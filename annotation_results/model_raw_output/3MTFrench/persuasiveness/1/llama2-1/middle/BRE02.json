The speaker does a good job of presenting their argument and using evidence to support their claims, but there are some areas where they could improve.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic of fenouillis germination. While they mention that it is an important aspect of their thesis, they do not provide enough detail or explanation for the audience to fully understand the significance of the research.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have been more clear and concise in their delivery. At times, their speech seems a bit disjointed and difficult to follow, with some sentences or ideas being repeated or not fully developed. This could be improved by practicing the speech and refining the delivery.\n\nFinally, while the speaker does provide evidence to support their claims, they could have gone into more detail on the methodology of their research. For example, they mention that they used tomographies to measure the embryonic activity during pregnancy, but they do not explain how these measurements were taken or what they reveal about the embryo's development. Providing more details on the research methods and findings could have added more weight to their argument and made it more convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does a good job of presenting their argument, there are some areas where they could improve to make their speech more persuasive and convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,966,1775,1144,302,29915,29948,13048,316,18371,283,453,275,29892,4079,443,1040,271,7209,16794,29889,1174,18371,283,1527,29892,3503,1661,1518,28378,743,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,348,564,344,19951,29892,1601,534,1682,712,966,269,4110,409,316,18371,283,453,275,4625,20737,1597,1375,362,2286,29889,1174,21181,29892,610,346,712,274,29915,342,443,7006,4191,2331,4105,29892,2331,316,521,542,324,271,29892,2331,316,22593,3381,29892,2331,316,18371,283,453,275,29889,2178,261,29889,838,943,29892,1465,611,266,17449,29892,1444,19760,12866,1518,492,7808,439,1379,3435,966,2114,11620,1750,1437,18821,296,425,4021,2131,270,29915,29882,837,262,1230,553,269,4110,316,18371,283,453,275,29889,1174,270,29915,14559,1840,267,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,1750,5246,712,29892,611,767,29888,1690,347,29892,27666,553,269,4110,316,425,610,6544,427,289,7293,20877,29948,29892,3503,1750,452,2453,352,296,2331,22593,261,29889,26383,454,10212,20141,634,301,29915,14056,7734,29892,432,29915,1794,3667,29552,2257,439,29915,309,409,21714,13180,425,22683,5340,316,611,767,29888,1690,347,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,21975,454,13222,316,425,19431,1116,362,316,872,432,324,347,9115,332,818,301,29915,18704,4771,29889,6803,18729,29892,611,767,29888,1690,347,29892,432,29915,264,592,992,533,18402,269,2603,457,29892,4191,7890,282,6223,29920,454,8689,29871,1654,29892,1671,7015,1998,3246,316,4313,12161,29892,6722,432,29915,1794,2779,27478,316,25226,4883,1973,610,6454,1946,583,29892,966,439,2561,1237,316,301,29915,4582,4437,29892,1750,592,19172,296,316,7199,9030,301,29915,11236,2131,7232,719,11586,533,16987,427,2058,13180,425,22683,5340,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,322,773,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,18371,283,453,275,22593,3381,29889,5806,896,3585,393,372,338,385,4100,9565,310,1009,266,6656,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,9493,470,8252,363,278,20026,304,8072,2274,278,26002,310,278,5925,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1063,901,2821,322,3022,895,297,1009,28289,29889,2180,3064,29892,1009,12032,2444,263,2586,766,12090,287,322,5189,304,1101,29892,411,777,25260,470,7014,1641,10324,470,451,8072,8906,29889,910,1033,367,16710,491,4120,18499,278,12032,322,2143,2827,278,28289,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,1550,278,25657,947,3867,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,896,1033,505,7695,964,901,9493,373,278,1158,3002,310,1009,5925,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,896,1304,6454,1946,583,304,5645,278,7232,719,8927,6354,2645,758,5138,6906,29892,541,896,437,451,5649,920,1438,20398,892,4586,470,825,896,10320,284,1048,278,7232,719,29877,29915,29879,5849,29889,9133,4821,901,4902,373,278,5925,3519,322,1284,886,1033,505,2715,901,7688,304,1009,2980,322,1754,372,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,12032,901,20408,294,573,322,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":73250594056,"load_duration":328703,"prompt_eval_count":344,"prompt_eval_duration":31889051000,"eval_count":324,"eval_duration":41360706000}
