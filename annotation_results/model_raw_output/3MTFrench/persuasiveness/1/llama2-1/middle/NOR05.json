The speaker provides some good points and evidence to support their argument, but there are also some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that the speaker provides a clear and concise definition of the term \"biomasse\" and explains how it can be used as a source of energy. They also provide examples of different types of biomass, such as agricultural waste and wood, which can be used to produce energy. However, the speaker could have provided more details on the process of producing combustible fuels from biomass, such as the specific techniques or technologies involved.\n\nAnother strength of the speech is that the speaker acknowledges potential drawbacks of using biomass as an energy source, such as the need for more research and development to improve the efficiency and scalability of the process. However, the speaker could have provided more detail on how these drawbacks can be addressed through further innovation or policy changes.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some areas where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a claim that \"la pire-olis, c'est la dégradation thermique d'une matériau d'un atmosphère sanoxygen pour avoir comprodi du chac bon dégasse non condensable et aussi une liquide ouille combustible,\" but does not provide any evidence or explanation to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more context or comparisons to help illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of using biomass as an energy source compared to other options.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some good points and evidence to support their argument, there are also areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and detailed to make their message more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,1794,5695,10788,29948,316,23532,1597,14857,1775,4894,585,2298,904,21553,1387,29889,10016,1775,4894,585,1750,2062,404,1249,966,29871,29946,6063,18554,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,427,2123,955,519,427,470,2993,29889,315,29915,342,1775,4894,585,269,29915,932,1808,425,4768,290,5793,29889,997,4768,290,5793,707,12563,1775,5289,2894,1387,270,29915,17234,26436,634,13019,1750,8164,7848,4327,1318,427,904,1089,12053,29889,1459,17488,29892,325,359,1437,305,1691,29892,425,1014,572,329,316,425,18032,545,707,5695,454,23734,29889,315,29915,342,18916,712,274,29915,342,6094,1908,425,8861,1139,316,1775,29948,346,29889,422,1004,29892,2653,29891,432,29915,4422,895,29920,5278,4768,290,5793,707,5246,1597,4145,504,1821,904,21553,1387,29889,8396,29892,282,1682,3547,29892,432,29915,1794,286,29915,404,15802,270,29915,1540,9580,29654,1750,269,29915,932,1808,425,282,533,29899,18301,29889,997,282,533,29899,18301,29892,274,29915,342,425,1437,5105,362,14563,1387,270,29915,1540,1775,4894,585,270,29915,348,15489,561,1908,269,1562,28596,1671,11469,752,5964,29875,868,521,562,10814,1437,29887,5793,1661,2148,575,519,634,5695,1597,15617,680,2123,1924,4145,504,1821,29889,3067,29885,1004,29892,1661,980,707,427,27869,1139,29889,422,1004,29892,707,29899,346,712,432,29915,1794,325,496,29948,454,4768,290,5793,2535,316,9200,29899,265,1671,9073,425,4145,504,1821,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,8128,777,1781,3291,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,8128,263,2821,322,3022,895,5023,310,278,1840,376,5365,290,5793,29908,322,18568,920,372,508,367,1304,408,263,2752,310,5864,29889,2688,884,3867,6455,310,1422,4072,310,4768,290,465,29892,1316,408,18032,3631,19863,322,8112,29892,607,508,367,1304,304,7738,5864,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,4902,373,278,1889,310,20811,4145,504,1821,4084,1379,515,4768,290,465,29892,1316,408,278,2702,13698,470,5722,11763,9701,29889,13,13,2744,1228,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,24084,2710,7037,4216,1627,29879,310,773,4768,290,465,408,385,5864,2752,29892,1316,408,278,817,363,901,5925,322,5849,304,11157,278,19201,322,8716,3097,310,278,1889,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,9493,373,920,1438,4216,1627,29879,508,367,20976,1549,4340,24233,362,470,8898,3620,29889,13,13,2951,278,916,1361,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,393,376,433,282,533,29899,18301,29892,274,29915,342,425,1437,5105,362,14563,1387,270,29915,1540,1775,4894,585,270,29915,348,15489,561,1908,269,1562,28596,1671,11469,752,5964,29875,868,521,562,10814,1437,29887,5793,1661,2148,575,519,634,5695,1597,15617,680,2123,1924,4145,504,1821,1699,541,947,451,3867,738,10757,470,8252,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,470,5734,14125,304,1371,28475,278,25486,322,766,17263,19771,310,773,4768,290,465,408,385,5864,2752,9401,304,916,3987,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,1781,3291,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,727,526,884,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,13173,304,1207,1009,2643,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":79187615153,"load_duration":160927,"prompt_eval_count":282,"prompt_eval_duration":25736224000,"eval_count":420,"eval_duration":53450839000}
