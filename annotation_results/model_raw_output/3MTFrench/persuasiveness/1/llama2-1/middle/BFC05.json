{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T13:30:38.548320622Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker presents their research in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their argument more convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic of creating an intelligent computer that can recognize creatures. While they mention their inspiration from the human brain and their use of artificial neural networks, they could have delved deeper into the challenges and limitations of creating such a system. This would have helped to establish the speaker's expertise and credibility in the field.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have provided more specific examples and evidence to support their claims about the effectiveness of their technique. For instance, they mention that they have developed a first digital brain capable of learning, but they do not provide any details on how this was achieved or what kind of results they have obtained. Providing more concrete examples and data would have strengthened their argument and made it more convincing to the audience.\n\nFinally, the speaker could have addressed potential objections and criticisms of their technique. For example, they could have discussed the ethical implications of creating a computer that can recognize and mimic human creativity, or the potential limitations of using artificial neural networks for this purpose. By addressing these concerns directly, the speaker could have made their argument more persuasive and rigorous.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas and techniques, they could benefit from providing more context, evidence, and consideration of potential objections to make their argument more convincing.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,461,9073,1671,7697,276,301,29915,4194,7289,13052,296,634,15390,316,25238,13639,966,9484,3698,1577,315,29915,342,18916,712,1444,14954,1173,818,527,1524,454,18165,17239,26808,7177,868,5147,345,585,3165,475,1465,4883,1824,4467,1871,19669,29889,8748,274,29915,342,23068,818,443,28710,316,26808,2873,19069,709,5541,29948,316,3533,4285,634,316,3533,4285,316,5549,7147,3408,29879,712,432,29915,1794,2653,13942,29877,2496,443,7017,5147,345,585,954,20600,15390,270,29915,932,7771,790,482,29889,315,29915,342,270,29915,328,381,712,5646,1027,2037,432,29915,296,23469,1601,22420,7289,818,25238,13639,270,29915,24430,966,1559,627,5908,29892,18158,553,286,1862,29892,7847,966,12216,2129,1190,553,4558,270,29915,4582,768,545,29889,5202,276,358,6309,29892,1444,3911,1399,1387,301,29915,12352,441,634,966,3291,1559,627,30000,303,3783,1750,16374,23532,12866,427,3248,301,29915,3027,29889,8748,18158,29892,1444,3911,7629,276,5644,262,270,29915,735,331,552,316,1426,267,19694,29879,610,425,6701,26744,1671,439,29915,309,263,544,11992,818,544,2487,381,634,818,15882,1487,19694,545,29889,8748,818,425,15422,1318,316,14344,270,29915,14559,26943,29889,3872,29883,29892,2298,1444,3911,7629,276,270,29915,3027,29892,2298,316,6316,634,6366,815,634,8288,316,9460,29889,29871,30219,29874,29892,274,29915,342,1597,11043,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,8861,10098,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,5925,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,4969,385,13052,296,6601,393,508,18720,907,3698,29889,5806,896,3585,1009,8681,12232,515,278,5199,17294,322,1009,671,310,23116,19677,14379,29892,896,1033,505,628,1490,25871,964,278,18066,267,322,27028,310,4969,1316,263,1788,29889,910,723,505,9213,304,10127,278,25657,29915,29879,17924,895,322,6625,4127,297,278,1746,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,1009,11043,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,3585,393,896,505,8906,263,937,13436,17294,15390,310,6509,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,445,471,14363,470,825,2924,310,2582,896,505,7625,29889,9133,4821,901,18387,6455,322,848,723,505,9324,6419,1009,2980,322,1754,372,901,17953,3277,304,278,20026,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,704,24247,322,11164,12903,310,1009,11043,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,15648,278,11314,936,2411,5795,310,4969,263,6601,393,508,18720,322,286,326,293,5199,907,28157,29892,470,278,7037,27028,310,773,23116,19677,14379,363,445,6437,29889,2648,3211,292,1438,21838,4153,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1754,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,13698,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,3030,29892,10757,29892,322,19220,310,7037,704,24247,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889],"total_duration":69870618832,"load_duration":148674,"prompt_eval_count":277,"prompt_eval_duration":24712412000,"eval_count":355,"eval_duration":45157557000}
