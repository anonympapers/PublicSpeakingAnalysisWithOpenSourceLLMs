{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T03:58:54.441000876Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker presents their idea in a clear and concise manner, using simple language and relatable examples to explain the concept of following a specific molecule within a cell. However, they lack conviction and enthusiasm in their delivery, which could have made their message more compelling. A more engaging and passionate delivery could have helped to persuade the audience more effectively.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is generally sound, as they acknowledge the complexity of the task at hand and explain how they plan to tackle it using micro-fluidics in goutlette. However, there are some areas where their logic could be improved. For example, they assume that each molecule has a specific \"ennu\" and \"meroganion\" without providing any evidence or explanation for why this is the case. Additionally, they do not address potential limitations or challenges of using micro-fluidics in goutlette, such as the difficulty in accurately measuring tiny amounts of fluid.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's idea has some merit, their delivery could benefit from more persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning to make a stronger argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,454,2298,316,2257,10505,19783,598,25810,12866,316,19397,10252,276,805,4582,6832,339,882,1597,6062,29948,1810,484,29892,782,2757,316,425,5227,275,457,1424,29948,1056,24453,3038,352,1908,29889,1704,2123,29875,29892,3058,267,270,29915,14056,20554,3119,30000,25873,443,17889,6299,11491,29889,6101,20554,3435,286,585,1564,4637,1095,307,1169,2123,286,585,1564,4637,19462,29892,9201,20081,2123,1209,2406,29892,18729,8164,11469,553,1136,21871,2063,8541,19669,29892,9291,29915,30001,610,17488,3269,261,425,5758,316,425,3038,352,1297,2123,454,24305,270,29915,1540,4439,328,347,29889,11948,3440,22572,29915,15669,1444,16623,1671,16219,381,2257,10505,19783,598,6062,29948,1810,5218,1577,382,29882,6079,29892,432,29915,1794,24984,443,3287,29877,10505,424,29889,1720,21668,6382,4983,18402,10814,954,10651,260,29915,267,4191,19154,301,29915,348,553,5541,1934,316,425,6062,29948,1810,484,29889,8748,12866,18402,6062,29948,1810,484,29892,4191,19154,29892,1597,553,4145,1099,14125,6458,793,868,3287,29877,29889,2581,19760,270,29915,264,534,8885,25763,7015,14746,316,27829,7719,29892,454,2123,301,29915,2108,29884,634,454,8774,307,6249,291,29892,3038,267,1750,24257,818,409,29889,838,943,1120,424,7890,2970,712,1243,261,818,425,1667,1597,610,1540,7015,14746,316,6062,29948,1810,484,29892,274,29915,342,10655,9301,29889,315,29915,342,1671,29871,4277,712,1465,301,29915,18441,373,3667,895,425,9200,29899,29888,839,1387,427,330,449,20200,29889,10793,5722,5458,29892,4875,592,14924,316,286,29915,647,1535,7608,5646,427,10212,20141,29889,8526,425,2058,270,29915,4422,7608,553,23131,267,29892,432,29915,4422,895,553,5697,3246,330,449,13650,267,316,13545,282,5283,3246,29889,10793,263,2970,29892,270,29915,29891,1701,347,2298,22577,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,322,1104,17219,6455,304,5649,278,6964,310,1494,263,2702,13206,29883,1297,2629,263,3038,29889,2398,29892,896,10225,7602,2463,322,23644,3173,29885,297,1009,28289,29892,607,1033,505,1754,1009,2643,901,752,7807,29889,319,901,3033,6751,322,15935,403,28289,1033,505,9213,304,20408,1943,278,20026,901,17583,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,6892,6047,29892,408,896,18145,5485,278,13644,310,278,3414,472,1361,322,5649,920,896,3814,304,22002,280,372,773,9200,29899,1579,5416,1199,297,330,449,20200,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,5900,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5251,393,1269,13206,29883,1297,756,263,2702,376,2108,29884,29908,322,376,1050,468,273,291,29908,1728,13138,738,10757,470,8252,363,2020,445,338,278,1206,29889,19814,29892,896,437,451,3211,7037,27028,470,18066,267,310,773,9200,29899,1579,5416,1199,297,330,449,20200,29892,1316,408,278,14656,297,7913,2486,7540,3864,21577,26999,310,22576,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2969,756,777,2778,277,29892,1009,28289,1033,14169,515,901,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,304,1207,263,23505,2980,29889],"total_duration":71196968764,"load_duration":164143,"prompt_eval_count":350,"prompt_eval_duration":32350232000,"eval_count":297,"eval_duration":38846182000}
