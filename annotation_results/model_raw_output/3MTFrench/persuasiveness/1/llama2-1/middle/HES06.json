{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T12:23:30.445075241Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker does present a clear and well-structured argument, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous. Here are some specific points:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes several claims about the difficulties of changing things in the current system, but they do not provide any empirical evidence to support these claims. This makes it difficult to evaluate the validity of their argument.\n2. Vagueness: At times, the speaker's language is vague or unclear, which can make it difficult to follow their reasoning. For example, what exactly does \"visible and hidden coups\" mean? How are they different from each other?\n3. Overemphasis on methodology: While the speaker does highlight the importance of their research methodology, they spend too much time discussing it and not enough time presenting their findings or addressing potential objections. This can make their argument feel overly focused on process rather than outcome.\n4. Lack of concreteness: The speaker's arguments are often quite abstract, which can make them difficult to understand or relate to. For example, what exactly does \"a socio-economic developed by professors, savales, and other researchers\" mean? How does it differ from other models?\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear argument, there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous or concrete. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects this evaluation.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,432,29915,264,21714,29889,4693,2487,9989,302,29915,23071,2331,544,5903,29884,29871,4277,29889,1459,346,712,29871,4277,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,544,5903,29884,1465,966,5900,28119,634,966,714,2719,553,3657,1446,29892,634,427,2298,29892,274,29915,342,9577,2923,25123,818,521,361,1341,261,29889,838,943,29892,3440,1874,261,966,521,15806,1577,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,29871,4277,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,29889,2581,6787,275,443,878,15340,15390,270,29915,25378,966,3581,567,29892,7962,634,966,3581,567,274,496,743,29889,8748,1444,6787,275,2257,878,15340,1465,1597,2637,7734,782,2757,316,425,2669,818,29871,4277,29889,26383,1597,8774,386,397,5458,316,23520,29892,1006,7316,29892,1208,326,1893,14090,427,1775,7241,1318,1190,454,878,15340,577,3934,29899,29872,4599,293,16797,29948,610,966,2600,5340,1295,29892,4048,2122,29892,818,553,2117,3610,1893,583,634,966,10890,14954,1173,1295,316,301,29915,895,332,29889,2581,7890,1518,9854,29889,435,29915,1639,307,479,553,3657,2650,1295,29892,553,5544,4427,7719,818,18402,10098,712,966,22700,14075,29889,2581,6267,26427,634,1444,6314,29872,316,19313,29892,4021,277,5056,29892,4323,277,5056,22347,5908,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,2266,526,777,2702,3291,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,3196,16726,1048,278,23553,310,6480,2712,297,278,1857,1788,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,14707,278,2854,537,310,1009,2980,29889,13,29906,29889,478,351,3837,404,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4086,338,25160,470,20871,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,304,1101,1009,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,825,3721,947,376,12872,322,7934,3581,567,29908,2099,29973,1128,526,896,1422,515,1269,916,29973,13,29941,29889,6811,7278,25101,373,1158,3002,29901,5806,278,25657,947,12141,278,13500,310,1009,5925,1158,3002,29892,896,18864,2086,1568,931,5353,292,372,322,451,3307,931,2198,292,1009,1284,886,470,3211,292,7037,704,24247,29889,910,508,1207,1009,2980,4459,975,368,21309,373,1889,3265,1135,21957,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,378,1037,841,404,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,6273,526,4049,3755,9846,29892,607,508,1207,963,5189,304,2274,470,29279,304,29889,1152,1342,29892,825,3721,947,376,29874,577,3934,29899,29872,4599,293,8906,491,25718,943,29892,4048,2122,29892,322,916,5925,414,29908,2099,29973,1128,947,372,1163,515,916,4733,29973,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,470,18387,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,445,17983,29889],"total_duration":62568185478,"load_duration":248463,"prompt_eval_count":243,"prompt_eval_duration":20727035000,"eval_count":339,"eval_duration":41840332000}
