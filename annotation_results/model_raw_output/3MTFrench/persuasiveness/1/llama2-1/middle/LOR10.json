The speaker presents some valid points about the importance of understanding the future of forests and the limitations of using crystal balls or simulators to predict wood production. However, the analogy with the beach and the sun is not particularly convincing and detracts from the overall message.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is not rigorous in several places, such as when they compare the forest to a beach and the trees to people competing for sunlight. This comparison is overly simplistic and does not take into account the complexities of forest ecosystems. Additionally, the analogy with climate change is also not fully developed, with the speaker simply stating that it is a factor without providing any details or evidence.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some important points about the need for accurate predictions and the limitations of current methods, their argument could be strengthened by more rigorous reasoning and a clearer explanation of the issues at hand.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,9073,1465,7814,363,29145,29889,6803,17043,13639,301,29915,3496,381,316,425,363,11992,29892,1444,766,1661,2331,1597,16380,280,316,15919,2122,29892,3503,443,29611,332,316,8182,9948,29889,7747,29611,332,707,15390,316,544,2487,381,425,4323,2131,316,23734,5434,316,425,363,11992,11076,29892,3503,1444,454,22300,15529,1089,1794,9577,2684,29872,29889,29075,336,352,5990,316,425,3533,631,261,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,325,1759,7199,9030,1354,301,29915,735,2488,553,3005,1144,818,425,8182,9948,363,11992,380,1908,29889,405,681,1671,29879,787,22572,29915,15669,439,29915,309,343,427,19947,4239,29889,28079,270,29915,24430,29892,425,363,11992,4875,29899,18202,29892,1559,7446,1564,993,454,7446,346,29892,7446,1564,993,966,564,16105,325,609,7848,427,25732,654,966,9644,2535,966,10890,1671,301,29915,5753,2093,818,425,19703,5289,29889,1459,17488,29892,15093,4370,7890,4788,29920,818,425,715,482,29892,634,712,14344,269,29915,309,343,707,694,533,316,9122,29892,7890,4788,29920,7848,427,25732,654,1671,1539,2484,26814,27299,2353,782,14419,309,29889,951,1473,1424,6574,19964,263,519,25810,966,1801,1691,868,1874,882,10784,15819,29889,1720,409,3534,4664,296,610,1597,18765,362,553,5694,1064,3698,634,610,1597,22964,918,316,301,29915,14531,26318,29889,830,854,787,1190,5278,715,482,29892,7890,29871,22730,610,854,29884,818,926,261,26814,27299,2353,782,14419,309,29889,4241,841,424,29892,980,5246,29871,29946,29906,867,743,634,7890,302,29915,1351,29920,2331,270,29915,14531,29889,20513,499,271,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,8004,278,5434,310,363,9197,322,278,27028,310,773,10901,11195,26563,470,1027,352,4097,304,8500,8112,5802,29889,2398,29892,278,3483,6933,411,278,25695,322,278,6575,338,451,10734,17953,3277,322,1439,1461,29879,515,278,12463,2643,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,12912,20657,297,3196,7600,29892,1316,408,746,896,7252,278,13569,304,263,25695,322,278,10697,304,2305,5100,292,363,6575,4366,29889,910,10230,338,975,368,5466,4695,322,947,451,2125,964,3633,278,4280,1907,310,13569,321,3944,973,29879,29889,19814,29892,278,3483,6933,411,23622,1735,338,884,451,8072,8906,29892,411,278,25657,3763,23659,393,372,338,263,7329,1728,13138,738,4902,470,10757,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,4100,3291,1048,278,817,363,16232,27303,322,278,27028,310,1857,3519,29892,1009,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,901,12912,20657,24481,322,263,26135,8252,310,278,5626,472,1361,29889],"total_duration":53854637276,"load_duration":175982,"prompt_eval_count":307,"prompt_eval_duration":25805922000,"eval_count":225,"eval_duration":28048122000}
