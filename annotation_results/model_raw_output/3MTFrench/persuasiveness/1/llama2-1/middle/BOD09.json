The speaker presents some innovative ideas for developing active learning strategies in education, but there are some limitations to their argument that prevent it from being completely convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's argument relies heavily on personal anecdotes and experiences, which may not be sufficient to convince skeptics or those who have not had similar experiences. While the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for their ideas are evident, they do not provide enough empirical evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's proposal to \"develop des pédagogie actives\" and \"travailler en mode projet\" is somewhat vague and lacks specific details on how these strategies would be implemented in practice. Without a clear plan of action, it is difficult to assess the feasibility or effectiveness of the proposed changes.\n\nLastly, the speaker's emphasis on the importance of \"construction de l'identité\" and \"echanger et travailler collectivement\" suggests that their vision for transforming the education system is centered around individual identity formation, rather than addressing broader structural issues within the system. While identity formation is certainly an important aspect of education, it is not the only factor that determines the effectiveness of learning strategies.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas for active learning strategies, their argument could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and empirical evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1551,2947,13942,29877,2496,553,282,2487,13247,347,1044,3145,29892,13545,868,18848,427,4464,15744,29892,1671,19172,276,818,301,29915,1893,566,12361,316,13942,29877,2496,553,752,29948,841,778,14333,1041,1465,454,9122,6351,9139,29889,1720,343,263,553,26943,818,23563,2245,29879,316,2600,29879,7602,475,8668,1750,1518,1064,2073,296,553,544,19669,24233,3794,29889,11948,707,29899,346,712,18729,9378,277,818,4327,261,454,21423,1577,315,13946,882,2331,29892,5646,1437,7241,29948,29892,12866,316,27962,316,13545,14511,5056,11695,2406,29892,818,1597,1841,295,4327,1318,1190,20364,553,544,19669,1465,301,29915,2611,5008,29889,8748,4191,432,29915,29874,603,553,11482,275,29892,274,29915,342,454,29140,316,611,266,17449,29889,11948,3440,27516,443,23930,647,424,1750,301,29915,10978,966,286,30037,4467,6515,316,2245,29879,316,2298,29871,29906,29900,6063,270,29915,370,9214,1089,553,4760,8192,553,6745,1475,29889,6803,19601,29892,1487,425,7632,868,302,9095,2893,2131,316,301,29915,8463,264,23520,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,316,13852,1950,29889,1720,302,29915,29891,263,2331,316,7632,2893,9407,1950,1190,302,29915,29874,6701,2331,966,23930,647,1934,818,21206,4600,634,818,29231,5495,6314,19882,29889,438,1481,29892,427,5246,29892,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,8463,2108,882,29892,980,260,29915,262,11236,2131,9577,899,9407,29889,838,943,29892,3440,269,29915,29891,23532,1577,2598,13752,17449,29892,634,439,29915,309,21668,1539,2484,966,18554,427,1970,8837,29892,1671,439,29915,1808,409,29564,439,29915,30001,2331,29892,316,13625,818,330,29539,1465,3999,6314,10270,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,777,24233,1230,7014,363,14338,6136,6509,16650,583,297,9793,29892,541,727,526,777,27028,304,1009,2980,393,5557,372,515,1641,6446,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,7333,385,687,29881,4769,322,27482,29892,607,1122,451,367,8002,304,7602,1239,18109,415,1199,470,1906,1058,505,451,750,2788,27482,29889,5806,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,322,15935,363,1009,7014,526,13602,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,29190,936,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24963,304,376,4888,553,282,2487,13247,347,1044,3145,29908,322,376,3018,1564,5495,427,4464,15744,29908,338,10579,25160,322,425,4684,2702,4902,373,920,1438,16650,583,723,367,8762,297,6944,29889,13932,263,2821,3814,310,3158,29892,372,338,5189,304,24809,278,28326,4127,470,2779,20193,310,278,7972,3620,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,19310,275,373,278,13500,310,376,3075,4080,316,301,29915,1693,2131,29908,322,376,5309,4600,634,29231,5495,6314,19882,29908,14661,393,1009,18551,363,4327,292,278,9793,1788,338,24764,2820,5375,10110,12409,29892,3265,1135,3211,292,2545,1664,2281,3631,5626,2629,278,1788,29889,5806,10110,12409,338,8959,385,4100,9565,310,9793,29892,372,338,451,278,871,7329,393,3683,1475,278,2779,20193,310,6509,16650,583,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,363,6136,6509,16650,583,29892,1009,2980,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,29190,936,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":74502122752,"load_duration":163703,"prompt_eval_count":321,"prompt_eval_duration":30685939000,"eval_count":338,"eval_duration":43815537000}
