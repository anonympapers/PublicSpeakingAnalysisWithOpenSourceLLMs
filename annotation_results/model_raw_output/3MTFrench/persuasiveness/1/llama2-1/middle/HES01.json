{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T12:20:18.612585469Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and metaphor to emphasize their point about the negative impact of climate change. However, the reasoning presented is not particularly rigorous or supported by empirical evidence.\n\nThe speaker's use of anecdotal evidence and personal experiences to illustrate their points can be seen as a way to build rapport with the audience, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the issue. The argument relies heavily on emotional appeals rather than logical reasoning, which may not be persuasive to those who prefer more data-driven approaches.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of hyperbole and exaggeration (\"il mique au fissure\") can be seen as a way to emphasize their point, but it also undermines the credibility of their argument. The lack of specific examples or data to support their claims further reduces the persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's use of rhetorical devices is effective in creating an emotional response, the lack of rigorous reasoning and empirical evidence hinders the persuasiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,443,9744,29892,443,553,282,2658,29892,301,29915,16063,333,2131,29889,3872,29883,29892,1444,1539,29879,1465,301,29915,14531,29889,8748,712,16623,29899,433,29892,425,22759,29892,425,1750,364,14056,29892,4875,282,681,344,29892,980,343,263,454,282,681,344,29892,634,712,16623,29899,433,1775,2628,29892,980,6896,2488,29892,980,302,29915,264,8164,2298,29892,7847,980,263,316,260,1144,427,19449,316,16977,261,749,29892,634,782,25927,270,29915,348,3058,3256,29892,980,12220,802,29889,2581,2453,1314,2970,29892,980,285,790,545,29892,782,2298,260,9373,29892,980,286,1387,782,285,790,545,29892,610,346,712,29871,4277,452,409,24722,2331,29889,8748,274,29915,342,2257,712,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,29892,425,285,790,545,29892,610,346,712,301,29915,1300,1387,712,1444,2906,417,915,592,19172,336,270,29915,12572,818,1597,21206,1808,9577,22577,29892,316,301,29915,19809,316,9200,29899,29885,1803,276,29892,18934,316,592,1437,699,29878,9411,7015,885,1690,8596,316,16573,29889,11948,472,841,311,29920,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,712,29871,4277,1465,301,29915,485,275,29892,610,346,712,427,2298,316,301,29915,326,6563,2131,316,10784,271,29892,7890,2123,12675,29920,325,359,16895,267,29892,26814,14931,29892,7890,2123,12675,29920,325,359,16895,267,29892,26814,19785,276,29892,7890,2123,12675,29920,325,359,16895,267,29892,26814,14931,29892,7890,2123,12675,29920,325,359,16895,267,29892,26814,19785,276,29892,634,1444,7890,1841,1324,29888,1908,29892,634,1444,7890,1841,1324,29888,1908,29892,3503,1444,7890,1841,1324,29888,1908,29892,3503,1444,7890,1841,1324,29888,1908,29892,3503,1444,7890,1841,1324,29888,1908,29892,3503,1444,7890,1841,1324,29888,1908,29892,289,999,29892,7890,301,375,29948,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,1539,481,2015,304,19310,675,1009,1298,1048,278,8178,10879,310,23622,1735,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,9132,338,451,10734,12912,20657,470,6969,491,29190,936,10757,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,27482,304,28475,1009,3291,508,367,3595,408,263,982,304,2048,13659,411,278,20026,29892,541,372,947,451,3867,263,15171,6270,7418,310,278,2228,29889,450,2980,337,3687,20365,373,23023,1848,5929,1338,3265,1135,16667,24481,29892,607,1122,451,367,20408,294,573,304,1906,1058,5821,901,848,29899,24477,854,13501,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,322,429,9921,362,4852,309,286,1387,782,285,790,545,1159,508,367,3595,408,263,982,304,19310,675,1009,1298,29892,541,372,884,563,837,1475,278,6625,4127,310,1009,2980,29889,450,10225,310,2702,6455,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,4340,26830,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,338,11828,297,4969,385,23023,1848,2933,29892,278,10225,310,12912,20657,24481,322,29190,936,10757,298,513,414,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":63662296858,"load_duration":189443,"prompt_eval_count":345,"prompt_eval_duration":29452866000,"eval_count":272,"eval_duration":34208711000}
