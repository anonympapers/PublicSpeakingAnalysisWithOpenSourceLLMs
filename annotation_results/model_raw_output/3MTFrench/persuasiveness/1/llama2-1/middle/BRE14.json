The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and gesture to emphasize their points and keep the listener engaged. They also provide historical context and examples to support their claims, which helps to build credibility and persuasiveness. However, there are some instances where the speaker's logic could be more rigorous, such as when they make generalizations about coloniality without providing clear definitions or explanations of the term.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of language and tone could be more nuanced in some areas. For example, their use of the phrase \"il m'écoute, il m'écoute pas\" (he's listening to me, but he's not really listening) could be seen as overly simplistic and lacking in depth. Similarly, their statement that \"des silences qui reviennent plusieurs fois dans mon corps plus et qui sont caractéristiques de cette logique que j'ai définis en promenar parti\" (silences that repeat multiple times in my body and are characteristic of this logic that I have defined) could be further developed to provide more insight into the speaker's train of thought.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a compelling argument, there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and nuanced to maximize the persuasiveness of their speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,872,1480,1387,316,18165,17239,29889,1720,452,8164,343,11469,316,5400,2131,7209,25539,2131,29889,8526,8019,316,2257,5246,29892,19601,29892,432,29915,24209,344,966,8774,3068,1608,267,316,5278,1480,1387,270,29915,29877,30071,280,1465,454,541,316,7199,9030,3440,425,5400,2131,263,5221,29948,818,301,29915,29948,2576,3381,4824,1387,316,3058,267,9434,375,634,301,29915,29948,2576,3381,5829,1387,553,10890,427,19896,457,782,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29889,1720,286,29915,4582,2663,29892,980,286,29915,4582,2663,2331,29892,274,29915,342,454,286,4582,2663,29889,2581,6773,29889,1174,13495,29892,2257,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,1465,425,18768,8691,316,611,17949,29892,2257,3435,966,10419,800,1426,29884,4999,29889,435,29915,711,16349,4191,966,288,29872,4090,690,868,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,1750,1437,699,1960,966,1399,335,22702,29892,4625,27219,790,29948,4239,285,465,267,29889,1174,5246,29892,1444,454,872,275,712,270,29915,25378,1597,26722,270,29915,4582,768,427,5400,484,8104,4379,29889,2726,286,1862,29892,553,266,19503,29892,553,13994,316,3114,29892,553,18845,29892,553,298,5137,2658,818,18741,29948,29892,553,4047,2063,1750,6664,23510,10741,10098,1465,1601,14913,2298,634,1750,3435,1559,23096,316,5278,1480,1387,712,432,29915,1794,1437,4951,275,427,2504,264,279,17756,29889,1720,5246,427,330,4196,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,7787,29892,980,16067,443,564,3274,533,2174,861,634,980,592,26427,1671,339,7768,432,29915,1794,3060,10770,316,29231,5495,1190,2257,29140,29889,435,29915,1794,25497,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,29502,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,3013,278,13254,17785,29889,2688,884,3867,15839,3030,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,6911,304,2048,6625,4127,322,20408,294,20193,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,8871,988,278,25657,29915,29879,5900,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29892,1316,408,746,896,1207,2498,17063,1048,25539,537,1728,13138,2821,15848,470,7309,800,310,278,1840,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,322,16225,1033,367,901,4948,8362,297,777,10161,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,671,310,278,16549,376,309,286,29915,4582,2663,29892,980,286,29915,4582,2663,2331,29908,313,354,29915,29879,19866,304,592,29892,541,540,29915,29879,451,2289,19866,29897,1033,367,3595,408,975,368,5466,4695,322,10225,292,297,10809,29889,20175,29892,1009,3229,393,376,2783,4047,2063,1750,6664,23510,10741,10098,1465,1601,14913,2298,634,1750,3435,1559,23096,316,5278,1480,1387,712,432,29915,1794,1437,4951,275,427,2504,264,279,17756,29908,313,25590,2063,393,12312,2999,3064,297,590,3573,322,526,17443,310,445,5900,393,306,505,3342,29897,1033,367,4340,8906,304,3867,901,25483,964,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,752,7807,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,4948,8362,304,5256,675,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,12032,29889],"total_duration":71152654633,"load_duration":157956,"prompt_eval_count":308,"prompt_eval_duration":28343048000,"eval_count":340,"eval_duration":42808394000}
