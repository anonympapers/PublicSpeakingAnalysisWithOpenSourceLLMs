{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T23:47:05.341574284Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score the speech as a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker presents some valid points and arguments, but there are also several areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's argument that \"there is no such thing as objective truth\" is somewhat problematic. While it is true that truth can be subjective and dependent on individual perspectives, it is also important to recognize that there are certain objective facts and realities that exist independently of our beliefs or opinions. For example, the speaker could have argued that while truth may be subjective, there are still certain universal principles or laws that apply across different cultures and societies.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's reliance on personal anecdotes and hypothetical scenarios can come across as unconvincing and lacking in substance. While these stories may be intended to illustrate a particular point, they do not provide any concrete evidence or logical reasoning to support the speaker's broader claims.\n\nFinally, the speaker's conclusion that \"we should just do what feels good\" is overly simplistic and does not take into account the potential consequences of such an approach. While it is important to prioritize personal happiness and fulfillment, it is also crucial to consider the impact of our actions on others and on society as a whole. A more nuanced approach might involve finding a balance between individual satisfaction and societal well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the speaker presents some thoughtful observations and insights, their reasoning could benefit from greater rigor and support. A higher score would require more substantial evidence and logical arguments to back up the claims made in the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,20935,29112,2721,1538,8573,29892,4228,6408,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,289,790,2724,29892,4281,754,1216,1210,6408,12795,2712,29892,15261,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,606,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4228,22511,30043,490,1046,588,29899,702,8573,432,9940,30045,733,29899,29957,1494,665,665,2237,29959,26348,20603,3805,29887,355,29893,702,29919,665,11011,1198,490,30557,31475,3646,287,665,594,6777,2282,1538,6253,30005,5413,2282,26566,2282,1586,29977,19829,14179,29892,2282,6785,9797,18752,29996,1938,292,1724,319,4671,4211,324,573,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,322,6273,29892,541,727,526,884,3196,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,376,12711,338,694,1316,2655,408,12091,8760,29908,338,10579,1108,2454,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,8760,508,367,4967,573,322,14278,373,5375,3736,1103,3145,29892,372,338,884,4100,304,18720,393,727,526,3058,12091,17099,322,1855,1907,393,1863,25499,310,1749,17750,29879,470,26971,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,28705,393,1550,8760,1122,367,4967,573,29892,727,526,1603,3058,15968,18671,470,14243,393,3394,4822,1422,4185,1973,322,5374,20850,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,12536,749,373,7333,385,687,29881,4769,322,13752,300,936,21846,508,2041,4822,408,443,535,3845,3277,322,10225,292,297,5960,749,29889,5806,1438,15874,1122,367,9146,304,28475,263,3153,1298,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,2545,1664,16726,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,15997,393,376,705,881,925,437,825,23880,1781,29908,338,975,368,5466,4695,322,947,451,2125,964,3633,278,7037,27721,310,1316,385,2948,29889,5806,372,338,4100,304,7536,277,675,7333,22722,322,6095,5589,358,29892,372,338,884,7618,1455,304,2050,278,10879,310,1749,8820,373,4045,322,373,12459,408,263,3353,29889,319,901,4948,8362,2948,1795,25135,9138,263,17346,1546,5375,26470,322,5374,26310,1532,29899,915,292,29889,13,13,797,15997,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2714,1319,13917,322,1663,5861,29892,1009,24481,1033,14169,515,7621,12912,272,322,2304,29889,319,6133,8158,723,1996,901,23228,10757,322,16667,6273,304,1250,701,278,16726,1754,297,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":83823830803,"load_duration":151607,"prompt_eval_count":394,"prompt_eval_duration":36022183000,"eval_count":375,"eval_duration":47801008000}
