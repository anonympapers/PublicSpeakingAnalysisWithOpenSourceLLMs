The speaker presents an innovative idea for biocompatible coatings that could potentially revolutionize the field of biomedicine. However, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: While the speaker mentions that they have successfully created biocompatible coatings in the lab, there is a lack of evidence to support the claim. More research and experiments should be conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of these coatings.\n2. Vagueness: At times, the speaker's language can be vague and unclear. For example, what exactly does \"super poli de p√¢mi\" mean? Providing more specific details and examples would help to clarify the concept.\n3. Overconfidence: The speaker seems to be overly confident in their claims, without fully addressing potential challenges or limitations. It is important to acknowledge the obstacles that may arise in developing and implementing these coatings, and to provide a more nuanced view of the situation.\n4. Lack of context: There is a lack of context provided about the current state of biocompatible coatings and the need for improvement. Providing more background information on the current research and technologies would help to establish the speaker's argument within a broader context.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents an interesting idea, there are areas where the argument could be strengthened to make it more persuasive and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,818,425,20877,29948,29889,1551,269,29915,262,1028,533,21394,316,2257,7303,29899,27048,1671,10135,374,7808,553,6664,11992,4110,13052,1237,29892,439,29915,30001,2331,10767,29884,270,29915,328,29948,768,296,5646,29892,443,7006,4191,1597,784,434,4946,1808,1750,19172,8356,316,784,1358,818,425,10098,316,20491,7545,316,3500,631,2123,10440,4239,2894,267,3165,2708,29889,751,392,373,14954,1173,818,10628,7869,443,1775,4894,295,29892,1750,2653,5582,7848,427,6958,2535,443,21423,4768,20015,29892,4313,30069,1358,634,878,3709,2257,1750,409,21714,1190,3700,553,7618,1455,267,1671,10019,1524,5646,5161,802,316,304,27375,2131,29889,360,29915,29877,30071,301,29915,5215,749,316,13942,29877,2496,553,6664,11992,4110,17799,12667,13876,29889,838,943,29892,373,263,1841,375,1039,818,1035,5606,261,427,10212,20141,427,269,29915,262,1028,8491,29889,2726,29442,793,29892,1597,6062,280,904,1810,371,9577,18142,21101,1750,1661,23422,263,553,364,1446,6282,29892,3503,427,2298,1750,707,17799,23712,29892,1444,12450,2016,29892,2428,1248,29875,316,282,30057,2460,29889,997,1248,29875,316,282,30057,2460,274,29915,342,1597,29835,316,2428,3350,29873,2535,10741,2117,267,29889,1720,8164,409,1539,2484,5898,425,13618,270,29915,1540,12563,22577,16380,280,29892,443,2852,271,439,29915,265,623,1808,1597,25169,1595,293,1297,29889,1720,8164,269,29915,1893,18362,4191,443,2706,331,663,2123,10440,9332,29948,425,13618,270,29915,351,15340,29889,1174,5246,29892,425,521,347,1509,707,443,7006,4191,966,1766,29894,4999,29889,1551,707,12111,794,5644,262,316,2428,15001,1179,1671,8689,4805,536,21735,29889,1551,302,29915,342,8164,29899,5474,2331,5695,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,385,24233,1230,2969,363,17799,23712,24296,886,393,1033,19998,19479,675,278,1746,310,4768,290,7486,457,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,393,896,505,8472,2825,17799,23712,24296,886,297,278,9775,29892,727,338,263,10225,310,10757,304,2304,278,5995,29889,5853,5925,322,15729,881,367,18043,304,22222,278,2779,20193,322,15332,310,1438,24296,886,29889,13,29906,29889,478,351,3837,404,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4086,508,367,25160,322,20871,29889,1152,1342,29892,825,3721,947,376,9136,1248,29875,316,282,30057,2460,29908,2099,29973,9133,4821,901,2702,4902,322,6455,723,1371,304,15544,278,6964,29889,13,29941,29889,6811,5527,5084,29901,450,25657,2444,304,367,975,368,24332,297,1009,16726,29892,1728,8072,3211,292,7037,18066,267,470,27028,29889,739,338,4100,304,18145,5485,278,14979,23435,393,1122,29030,297,14338,322,16049,1438,24296,886,29892,322,304,3867,263,901,4948,8362,1776,310,278,6434,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,3030,29901,1670,338,263,10225,310,3030,4944,1048,278,1857,2106,310,17799,23712,24296,886,322,278,817,363,20414,29889,9133,4821,901,3239,2472,373,278,1857,5925,322,5722,11763,723,1371,304,10127,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,2629,263,2545,1664,3030,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,385,8031,2969,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":73208921366,"load_duration":227478,"prompt_eval_count":330,"prompt_eval_duration":30595522000,"eval_count":332,"eval_duration":42612718000}
