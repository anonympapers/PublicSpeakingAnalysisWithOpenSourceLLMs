The speaker presents their research project in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their argument more convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could provide more context and background information on the topic of vascular disease and the importance of studying it. While they mention that they cannot work directly on humans due to ethical concerns, they do not explain why this is a problem or how their research will contribute to the understanding of vascular disease. Providing more context would help to establish the relevance and significance of their project.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker provides some details on their research methodology, they could be more specific about the steps involved in creating a venous thrombosis model in the conchon. For example, how will they create a simulated blood vessel system, and what materials will they use to mimic the properties of human blood vessels? Providing more details on their methodology would help to demonstrate the rigor of their research design.\n\nFinally, while the speaker mentions that they have tested and refined their protocol through experiments with artificial vessels, they do not provide any information on how they will validate their results or address potential sources of error. This is an important aspect of scientific research, as it helps to establish the reliability and accuracy of the findings.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, there are some areas where they could improve to make their project more persuasive and rigorous in terms of reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1750,301,29915,314,29654,29889,3872,29883,1671,19397,2852,566,631,5278,4439,328,347,29892,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,29231,5495,1513,882,1190,301,29915,21708,29892,432,29915,1794,3008,28230,270,29915,348,878,15340,9364,424,1750,12852,316,260,8284,634,316,8774,3068,6386,1027,309,1908,29889,2598,15744,316,23520,707,12866,316,9484,261,872,25063,15828,325,1690,852,14255,454,378,305,265,1671,19397,966,2852,566,631,29889,2581,24108,818,610,481,12898,305,381,782,17814,10936,29892,3440,9484,261,1597,25063,15828,1750,12852,1027,309,1908,818,2257,1750,409,21714,14255,301,29915,21708,29892,3440,454,378,305,265,2947,1841,351,381,29892,3440,22944,2257,3209,29899,29891,585,29378,27478,634,4145,819,316,8714,29889,3872,29883,1671,29871,4277,29892,1444,904,12324,15471,301,29915,348,29889,435,29915,1794,6958,29948,270,29915,14559,29496,427,3444,818,301,29915,18949,4600,29889,2581,6427,8284,2535,966,325,1690,5908,29889,2581,1243,29948,634,337,29899,1688,29948,454,17814,10936,1190,553,325,1690,267,19069,28119,29889,2581,592,302,29915,29891,4575,852,427,17814,10936,1750,707,20629,427,19723,361,29892,274,29915,342,818,2970,29889,751,29875,12852,454,11387,9201,611,23448,424,1950,29889,9194,1362,302,29915,342,29899,346,712,432,29915,1794,10684,29892,1444,282,1387,1597,325,1690,782,19666,868,17103,29892,1597,325,1690,782,19666,868,282,492,316,301,29915,2108,331,29889,1459,7015,4239,1035,2093,29892,432,29915,485,749,443,8287,327,712,1444,325,1759,330,265,29888,1358,1671,16454,782,2298,818,425,325,1690,1004,634,782,22591,634,432,29915,264,432,29915,264,29926,687,316,425,25063,26062,29892,443,10823,1750,6136,425,1302,351,2785,29889,8748,432,29915,1131,1975,712,454,4771,409,4327,29872,782,5777,453,327,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,5925,2060,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,325,6151,1070,17135,322,278,13500,310,23382,372,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,2609,664,4153,373,25618,2861,304,11314,936,21838,29892,896,437,451,5649,2020,445,338,263,1108,470,920,1009,5925,674,29126,304,278,8004,310,325,6151,1070,17135,29889,9133,4821,901,3030,723,1371,304,10127,278,29527,749,322,26002,310,1009,2060,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,4902,373,1009,5925,1158,3002,29892,896,1033,367,901,2702,1048,278,6576,9701,297,4969,263,6003,681,266,456,29890,19263,1904,297,278,378,305,265,29889,1152,1342,29892,920,674,896,1653,263,1027,7964,10416,21239,1788,29892,322,825,17279,674,896,671,304,286,326,293,278,4426,310,5199,10416,24479,29973,9133,4821,901,4902,373,1009,1158,3002,723,1371,304,22222,278,12912,272,310,1009,5925,2874,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,393,896,505,9528,322,2143,1312,1009,9608,1549,15729,411,23116,24479,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2472,373,920,896,674,12725,1009,2582,470,3211,7037,8974,310,1059,29889,910,338,385,4100,9565,310,16021,5925,29892,408,372,6911,304,10127,278,12536,3097,322,13600,310,278,1284,886,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2060,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,297,4958,310,24481,29889],"total_duration":77834827545,"load_duration":235091,"prompt_eval_count":352,"prompt_eval_duration":32247021000,"eval_count":351,"eval_duration":45587043000}
