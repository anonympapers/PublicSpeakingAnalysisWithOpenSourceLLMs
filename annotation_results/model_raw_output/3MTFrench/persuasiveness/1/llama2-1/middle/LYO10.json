{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T09:57:05.316218054Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give the speaker a score of 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using simple language and avoiding technical jargon. They also use rhetorical questions to engage the audience and make their message more relatable. However, the speaker's argument is not particularly original or groundbreaking, and they do not provide any compelling evidence to support their claims beyond anecdotal examples. Therefore, while the speaker is able to present their case effectively, they do not convince the audience of the importance of their message.\n\nRigorous reasoning: The speaker's argument relies heavily on their own research and experiments, which are not necessarily rigorously tested or peer-reviewed. While the speaker provides some details about their methods and procedures, there is a lack of scientific rigor in their reasoning. Additionally, the speaker makes some broad generalizations without providing sufficient evidence to support them. For example, they claim that certain proteins are essential for muscle development without providing any data or studies to back up this claim. Therefore, while the speaker's reasoning is not entirely flawed, it could benefit from more rigorous scientific scrutiny.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their argument in a clear and engaging manner, they do not provide any particularly compelling evidence to support their claims, and their reasoning could benefit from greater scientific rigor.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1551,610,280,316,5697,3246,11387,966,13949,439,29915,265,263,592,410,6772,457,29889,3872,29883,1436,6311,29892,274,29915,342,872,15481,371,316,1601,18848,29889,1605,6223,29920,966,410,6772,1475,1750,325,609,19172,276,782,2301,29883,316,409,13942,29877,2496,29892,4239,18165,1056,2658,634,4239,6316,7545,29892,1465,553,5855,5994,2122,29889,8407,9775,327,29892,432,29915,1794,12866,544,2487,4582,29948,454,2301,1810,5218,29889,2581,966,21206,283,347,818,343,261,1465,6267,22577,1045,30058,371,316,9257,29892,8532,29892,316,1661,9411,966,18254,5632,1237,4555,20554,23997,3008,28230,1671,409,13942,29877,2496,29889,8748,7847,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,5231,16555,14984,966,410,6772,1475,316,274,5340,29920,454,2301,1810,5218,29889,315,29915,342,427,9644,443,3300,12621,29892,2298,316,29871,29906,29900,29900,29900,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,1794,5246,443,23013,634,432,29915,264,7468,7019,1464,5483,712,274,29915,342,443,7006,2298,316,29871,29896,29900,29900,29900,29889,8748,432,29915,264,7468,7019,1464,5483,2684,882,29871,29946,29947,29900,26695,1671,9073,26617,16794,29892,443,274,11710,29889,29871,30219,29874,1136,2488,818,1243,261,1597,818,1597,521,562,1540,316,3999,410,6772,1475,29889,461,1444,16623,1577,435,29915,1794,3984,1190,4883,3038,2540,29892,443,27666,1750,14924,316,1437,509,29884,533,805,4582,6832,339,882,1597,410,6772,457,29889,8748,7847,29892,432,29915,1794,4880,29948,4883,3038,2540,29892,19449,16797,743,634,6316,453,381,7209,5278,410,6772,457,270,29915,524,1064,11992,29889,897,5278,2258,15529,29892,432,29915,1794,2653,15882,1597,325,292,941,457,316,410,6772,1475,1053,1934,1671,454,24305,2301,1810,5218,29889,11948,3711,19211,29892,425,17949,270,29915,3470,7425,14954,634,6628,1314,263,1597,410,6772,457,1750,4439,28661,22527,1671,7890,29892,286,29915,328,1527,311,316,17161,261,425,954,1690,347,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,278,25657,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,322,4772,292,16905,432,1191,265,29889,2688,884,671,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,451,10734,2441,470,5962,1030,5086,29892,322,896,437,451,3867,738,752,7807,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,8724,385,687,6333,284,6455,29889,7857,29892,1550,278,25657,338,2221,304,2198,1009,1206,17583,29892,896,437,451,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,13500,310,1009,2643,29889,13,13,29934,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,1009,1914,5925,322,15729,29892,607,526,451,12695,12912,272,5794,9528,470,23533,29899,27828,287,29889,5806,278,25657,8128,777,4902,1048,1009,3519,322,28648,29892,727,338,263,10225,310,16021,12912,272,297,1009,24481,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,3732,777,7300,2498,17063,1728,13138,8002,10757,304,2304,963,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,3058,3279,1144,526,18853,363,2301,2841,5849,1728,13138,738,848,470,11898,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,7857,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,9186,17422,8734,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,16021,14387,329,4901,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3033,6751,8214,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,10734,752,7807,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,322,1009,24481,1033,14169,515,7621,16021,12912,272,29889],"total_duration":76015260771,"load_duration":228961,"prompt_eval_count":373,"prompt_eval_duration":34488459000,"eval_count":328,"eval_duration":41526022000}
