{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T11:48:02.367084555Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively presents their argument by using an analogy to explain how local actors can be just as influential in international affairs as the state. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's use of the \"pat√© and times craint\" analogy is a creative way to explain the concept of local actors influencing international affairs. It helps the listener visualize the idea that local actors can have an impact beyond their immediate surroundings.\n\nHowever, the speaker could have provided more context and evidence to support their claim. For example, they could have mentioned specific examples of local actors influencing international policy or provided data on the increasing importance of non-state actors in global affairs. This would have strengthened the speaker's argument and made it more convincing.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments to their position. For example, they could have acknowledged the potential risks associated with giving too much power to local actors, such as a lack of consistency in policy or a lack of accountability. By addressing these concerns, the speaker could have further convinced the listener of the importance of recognizing the role of local actors in international affairs.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a compelling argument, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,20554,3435,16530,20564,5039,264,425,1775,5289,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,425,260,30057,1173,316,1437,18821,261,29871,1654,301,29915,273,725,1288,4371,316,7015,1044,11620,1180,2993,26030,13545,7006,22786,743,454,1601,459,1772,770,1387,316,301,29915,16061,1465,966,5354,267,13547,712,301,29915,29874,680,553,325,22156,29889,478,681,7890,26427,29920,8164,29899,5474,29892,3503,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,29871,4277,1735,712,2257,12852,301,29915,16061,2123,966,8478,7719,1887,267,1750,946,19047,1577,8748,6079,1840,568,29920,29899,4346,29875,1597,22577,15690,347,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,4191,454,2373,29948,634,454,10098,274,5270,29889,2581,7890,1518,9854,29889,1720,21668,6382,4983,425,20244,20110,4191,443,289,2029,316,10098,2646,29889,8748,14864,966,13219,3842,4655,277,7147,553,5302,6121,267,29892,2257,289,2029,25810,5541,29948,270,29915,348,2348,29878,2487,993,5412,634,12852,766,424,2143,4983,301,29915,16061,29889,2448,25810,29899,346,439,29915,348,1804,29884,634,439,29915,1540,8478,2131,1887,25810,10918,21998,1671,1139,1089,1597,11398,20110,316,301,29915,16061,1577,315,29915,342,325,17016,29892,301,29915,21871,27445,868,286,585,1564,275,748,7425,29892,4191,782,6299,316,454,2373,29948,634,454,10098,2646,29889,2401,7771,277,1738,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,22981,1009,2980,491,773,385,3483,6933,304,5649,920,1887,29701,508,367,925,408,7112,2556,297,6121,19469,408,278,2106,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,278,376,5031,29948,322,3064,274,5270,29908,3483,6933,338,263,907,1230,982,304,5649,278,6964,310,1887,29701,13787,3277,6121,19469,29889,739,6911,278,13254,7604,675,278,2969,393,1887,29701,508,505,385,10879,8724,1009,16800,8388,618,886,29889,13,13,17245,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,5276,2702,6455,310,1887,29701,13787,3277,6121,8898,470,4944,848,373,278,10231,13500,310,1661,29899,3859,29701,297,5534,19469,29889,910,723,505,9324,6419,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,322,1754,372,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,304,1009,2602,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,24084,3192,278,7037,5161,2039,6942,411,6820,2086,1568,3081,304,1887,29701,29892,1316,408,263,10225,310,5718,3819,297,8898,470,263,10225,310,3633,3097,29889,2648,3211,292,1438,21838,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4340,25617,278,13254,310,278,13500,310,5936,5281,278,6297,310,1887,29701,297,6121,19469,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,752,7807,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":64373620937,"load_duration":150381,"prompt_eval_count":255,"prompt_eval_duration":23562699000,"eval_count":316,"eval_duration":40810270000}
