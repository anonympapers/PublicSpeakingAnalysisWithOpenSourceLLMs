{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T17:14:17.499483969Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a persuasive message and present a rigorous argument. The speaker provides clear examples and anecdotes to support their claim that dance is not only a form of artistic expression but also a way for young people to learn valuable skills such as discipline, creativity, and teamwork. They also acknowledge the challenges faced by dancers in terms of social perception and access to formal training.\n\nThe speaker's use of rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"Mais mes entretiens ont révélé...\"), parallel structure (\"C'est pas siempre bien vu par les parents qui imagine un métier rangé pour leurs enfants\"), and vivid imagery (\"le ciel bas et dévalorisé\") helps to emphasize their points and engage the audience.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the speech could be improved. For instance, the speaker could have provided more specific data or statistics to support their claims about the benefits of dance training. Additionally, the conclusion could have been more concise and impactful, summarizing the main points made in the speech and leaving a lasting impression on the audience.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a well-reasoned and persuasive argument for the importance of dance training, and their use of rhetorical devices helps to make the speech more engaging and memorable.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6094,10500,29892,966,23734,409,619,2406,1671,454,23734,29892,966,363,479,1295,373,1671,454,9073,29892,301,29915,1893,8284,1295,1671,425,11196,545,29892,634,966,867,347,2993,409,3435,966,7664,267,29889,11948,4883,2637,2034,575,4625,1841,29894,9509,712,316,2298,427,2298,316,1465,261,29892,452,3435,2331,5273,25802,1465,1597,11449,316,867,347,2993,29889,16932,4625,270,30095,623,29878,9030,14857,358,29889,315,29915,342,2331,15237,6079,18679,610,966,11825,1750,14034,443,11510,631,19120,29948,1671,10713,21038,634,26154,610,346,712,966,867,347,2993,6919,296,443,364,1947,585,782,24850,2362,634,1437,791,272,11728,29889,3872,29883,19601,29892,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,454,13382,29892,1444,269,29915,1131,1975,818,23532,766,482,1871,295,29892,782,2757,316,425,11449,2225,802,639,24359,4191,443,1016,634,1841,29881,1524,818,553,883,800,2298,883,1379,29892,782,2757,316,29868,634,316,6411,1759,29889,6803,18729,29892,432,29915,1794,623,3780,454,269,8846,271,316,26722,938,6270,18934,270,29915,12572,25179,26283,2535,454,6025,344,332,29889,435,29915,1794,5820,29948,316,20081,6411,1759,29892,432,29915,1794,5246,553,2637,2034,575,634,1444,26099,325,4814,443,11107,316,2301,1654,575,1465,966,5152,3302,316,269,8846,271,316,16014,29889,2664,21592,19503,29892,966,15182,1179,29892,4239,16283,4191,316,26245,29889,2581,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,20408,294,573,2643,322,2198,263,12912,20657,2980,29889,450,25657,8128,2821,6455,322,385,687,29881,4769,304,2304,1009,5995,393,17948,338,451,871,263,883,310,1616,4695,4603,541,884,263,982,363,4123,2305,304,5110,21114,25078,1316,408,29822,29892,907,28157,29892,322,3815,1287,29889,2688,884,18145,5485,278,18066,267,20050,491,270,4564,414,297,4958,310,5264,639,1441,322,2130,304,11595,6694,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,4852,29924,1759,4883,2637,2034,575,4625,1841,29894,9509,856,4968,8943,3829,4852,29907,29915,342,2331,26692,6079,18679,610,966,11825,1750,14034,443,11510,631,19120,29948,1671,10713,21038,4968,322,325,3640,6382,708,4852,280,24850,2362,634,1437,791,272,11728,1159,6911,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,3033,482,278,20026,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,263,2846,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,848,470,13964,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,23633,310,17948,6694,29889,19814,29892,278,15997,1033,505,1063,901,3022,895,322,10879,1319,29892,19138,5281,278,1667,3291,1754,297,278,12032,322,10124,263,1833,292,17188,373,278,20026,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,23147,287,322,20408,294,573,2980,363,278,13500,310,17948,6694,29892,322,1009,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,6911,304,1207,278,12032,901,3033,6751,322,26959,519,29889],"total_duration":66937297306,"load_duration":165344,"prompt_eval_count":274,"prompt_eval_duration":26051696000,"eval_count":313,"eval_duration":40884895000}
