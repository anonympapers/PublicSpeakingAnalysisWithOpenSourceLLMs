{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T13:16:09.791716858Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does provide some convincing arguments and reasoning to support their claims, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that the speaker provides clear and concise explanations of the concepts they are discussing. For example, they do a good job of explaining the concept of \"liaison\" and how it applies to the structure of proteins. They also provide some interesting insights into the way that molecules move and interact within the protein, which helps to build a sense of complexity and dynamics.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speaker could be more rigorous in their reasoning. For example, they mention that \"the structure of the protéine and therefore the contours of this biérinte bougent with time,\" but they do not provide any specific examples or evidence to support this claim. Similarly, when discussing the movement of molecules within the protein, they simply state that \"she [the molecule] tries to fix itself on a new path,\" without providing any explanation for how this process works.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speaker could be more rigorous in their reasoning, the transcript provides a clear and engaging explanation of complex concepts related to protein structure and dynamics.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,19746,782,8442,316,425,410,6772,457,29892,1750,707,270,29915,8284,1295,17899,29948,1190,454,1998,2491,1750,286,29915,29874,29868,29889,478,681,282,6223,29920,8689,5278,410,6772,457,4191,443,9775,631,262,316,4280,267,782,8442,868,13295,8310,1387,425,6454,3197,29889,319,1436,270,29915,1893,566,631,2257,1374,1690,290,8146,316,301,423,2285,29892,2298,427,2600,13469,332,29892,980,707,4100,316,19397,454,1027,8584,29892,610,17488,1190,22420,7289,29889,6803,18729,29892,373,5246,16794,818,553,878,30000,793,5844,2249,19669,1750,325,609,1437,699,276,301,29915,1639,2467,2637,23778,29892,425,6062,29948,1810,484,29892,316,1601,19100,680,316,1559,15933,634,425,410,6772,457,29889,1551,269,29915,2749,424,16731,8532,316,425,12784,27046,29892,425,3829,316,425,410,6772,457,634,12866,966,640,2470,316,18729,4768,1064,6693,289,692,296,2535,454,8714,29889,751,392,818,425,6062,29948,1810,484,316,1601,19100,680,316,1559,15933,29892,1597,10098,1465,2257,9775,631,262,29892,4875,409,26745,427,5305,868,8442,29889,315,29915,342,818,2970,316,425,6454,915,1190,27612,4875,2947,260,5893,316,409,2329,261,29889,8748,7628,339,29915,1808,18331,818,1597,3095,5793,29892,4875,263,12033,29948,1027,2037,443,1874,882,316,5285,868,9775,631,262,1671,19397,409,3484,261,818,443,13164,26786,29889,1605,2093,6079,29892,3503,2970,29920,29899,23088,23422,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,8128,2821,322,3022,895,7309,800,310,278,22001,896,526,5353,292,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,437,263,1781,4982,310,24232,278,6964,310,376,4456,2285,29908,322,920,372,16058,304,278,3829,310,3279,1144,29889,2688,884,3867,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,982,393,13206,21337,4337,322,16254,2629,278,26823,29892,607,6911,304,2048,263,4060,310,13644,322,19753,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,367,901,12912,20657,297,1009,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,376,1552,3829,310,278,410,6772,457,322,5480,278,640,2470,310,445,4768,1064,6693,289,692,296,411,931,1699,541,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,20175,29892,746,5353,292,278,10298,310,13206,21337,2629,278,26823,29892,896,3763,2106,393,376,11360,518,1552,13206,29883,1297,29962,14335,304,2329,3528,373,263,716,2224,1699,1728,13138,738,8252,363,920,445,1889,1736,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,367,901,12912,20657,297,1009,24481,29892,278,1301,924,8128,263,2821,322,3033,6751,8252,310,4280,22001,4475,304,26823,3829,322,19753,29889],"total_duration":64389631162,"load_duration":236871,"prompt_eval_count":280,"prompt_eval_duration":25705975000,"eval_count":299,"eval_duration":38682870000}
