The speaker does provide some interesting insights and observations about the human dimension of the solutions being discussed, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that it provides concrete examples and anecdotes to illustrate its points. For instance, the speaker uses the metaphor of a biche crossing a field to illustrate the challenges of navigating a complex issue like the one being discussed. This helps to make the speech more relatable and engaging for the audience.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, when discussing the potential solutions to the issue at hand, the speaker mentions that \"la région finance pour en replanter.\" While this may be true, it would be more persuasive if the speaker provided more evidence or context to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's use of the phrase \"une oeil, ça peut être gênante à coupune par salande\" could be more nuanced and thoughtful, as it is not entirely clear what the speaker is trying to convey with this statement.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some interesting insights and observations, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based support for its claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,17889,316,611,266,17449,427,5646,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,932,9555,553,17043,790,2925,1190,425,9927,3165,9874,316,7015,6851,29889,341,1004,7561,29881,29892,301,29915,26739,362,634,301,29915,264,339,9061,29889,6803,301,29915,26739,362,29892,1444,28511,1671,1841,13094,553,1044,11620,1750,1539,29873,296,443,29871,19898,7015,6851,1671,8689,966,1444,1314,316,19397,29889,6803,301,29915,264,339,9061,29892,1444,966,1006,307,1173,9411,4348,27751,1671,7015,11382,1575,3479,26971,29889,1459,17488,29892,14034,29920,1597,6815,3814,9221,23249,274,16555,2606,1908,29892,12796,1318,610,4239,784,1475,363,11521,5908,29889,997,289,4070,29892,712,7890,29871,22730,29892,633,681,650,818,27962,316,301,29915,1540,818,301,29915,18288,29889,1105,361,712,18097,7890,18331,29920,782,13222,29892,7890,19643,29920,16731,439,29915,309,302,29915,29891,263,2331,21394,316,904,5547,1671,7890,274,11665,7628,316,26814,13310,1318,29889,11948,7890,29871,22730,19872,1314,29892,1444,454,29758,6079,29889,478,681,7890,301,29915,264,872,275,18097,6701,29889,1174,1791,424,18097,6701,3479,946,1759,29889,8748,7890,8992,29920,6079,18836,29892,1559,21975,454,13222,29892,7890,6454,15325,1190,443,9221,12906,371,332,1750,7890,6309,29889,10016,288,23270,29892,29871,4277,8164,7848,330,5512,749,818,17103,1540,610,4497,4182,29889,11948,980,1702,13871,712,425,14326,1436,749,1671,427,337,9018,357,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,1794,8164,7848,9577,1841,1579,17192,381,29889,9194,280,1875,29892,7890,1671,15749,9364,276,26814,26786,1190,443,17887,1644,29875,1045,11728,2123,7890,867,1690,26477,782,14858,28667,711,29948,29889,751,392,5646,263,17103,29892,7890,29271,346,13325,782,658,262,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,8031,1663,5861,322,13917,1048,278,5199,9927,310,278,6851,1641,15648,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,372,8128,18387,6455,322,385,687,29881,4769,304,28475,967,3291,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,3913,278,1539,481,2015,310,263,289,4070,24067,263,1746,304,28475,278,18066,267,310,12402,1218,263,4280,2228,763,278,697,1641,15648,29889,910,6911,304,1207,278,12032,901,1104,17219,322,3033,6751,363,278,20026,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,5353,292,278,7037,6851,304,278,2228,472,1361,29892,278,25657,26649,393,376,433,14326,1436,749,1671,427,337,9018,357,1213,5806,445,1122,367,1565,29892,372,723,367,901,20408,294,573,565,278,25657,4944,901,10757,470,3030,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,278,16549,376,1540,288,23270,29892,29871,4277,8164,7848,330,5512,1647,818,17103,1540,610,4497,4182,29908,1033,367,901,4948,8362,322,2714,1319,29892,408,372,338,451,9186,2821,825,278,25657,338,1811,304,27769,411,445,3229,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,756,777,8031,1663,5861,322,13917,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,2304,363,967,16726,29889],"total_duration":69114578390,"load_duration":304679,"prompt_eval_count":337,"prompt_eval_duration":31224420000,"eval_count":297,"eval_duration":37889373000}
