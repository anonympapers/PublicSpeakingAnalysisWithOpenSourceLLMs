{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T09:55:49.288430234Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 on the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents a clear and concise message, using technical terms to describe the properties of the materials involved. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous, such as when explaining the formation of the thermodynamic bond between Arthur and Monique.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of using analogy to help explain complex concepts, but at times the explanations feel superficial or lacking in depth. For example, the comparison of Monique's molecules to \"athous\" and \"propriétés dynamiques\" is not fully explained, leaving the listener without a clear understanding of these terms.\n\nAdditionally, there are some moments where the speaker could have provided more context or clarification, such as when explaining the concept of \"banque conjugale\" or \"thermodure rigide irreversible.\" While the speaker does their best to simplify these concepts, they could benefit from further explanation to fully convince the listener of their persuasiveness.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-delivered and easy to follow, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and detailed to fully convince the listener of the speaker's message.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,14563,1387,634,8774,3068,1387,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,11498,634,13855,488,29892,1506,895,332,29892,285,790,545,29892,5796,415,545,29892,269,29915,284,535,29948,29892,3503,2331,316,7243,1387,29892,980,343,263,1601,1387,29889,2598,1387,263,5278,1597,14857,6635,2445,7661,316,24324,1908,29892,443,14563,459,4230,1387,29889,2598,1387,29892,6299,29892,707,316,6079,6062,267,5898,966,2258,1169,316,425,521,744,332,29889,12390,17622,681,29892,7015,10850,28141,4292,3783,634,301,29915,579,1387,29889,838,943,29892,16623,787,966,409,4325,9996,261,634,715,265,479,787,1465,6267,938,326,2131,29889,8407,5646,13222,29892,11498,634,2598,1387,269,29915,296,3906,6079,29889,1720,363,358,7209,1597,1650,2730,1764,818,7814,6299,1934,17422,3200,26325,13805,29892,3503,18916,29892,432,29915,1639,29894,993,29889,2581,1601,371,425,5694,19113,316,6267,9892,802,25482,744,634,11498,1841,23121,29889,1720,2947,5443,261,7015,6062,29948,21337,966,1597,29872,6394,10890,316,2298,427,2298,325,568,9291,29915,30001,4642,443,28710,427,7732,13391,29889,853,14563,397,545,12912,680,19950,874,1821,29889,838,943,29892,2598,1387,452,409,2665,2298,818,872,2058,2637,966,13137,270,29915,442,1973,2123,3261,634,818,29188,439,29915,309,1841,23121,29889,8748,4875,2947,409,1539,2484,427,16380,280,634,9073,11179,1030,818,760,29889,8748,274,29915,342,610,5278,7019,862,362,712,2598,1387,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2643,29892,773,16905,4958,304,8453,278,4426,310,278,17279,9701,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29892,1316,408,746,24232,278,12409,310,278,14563,397,8739,21224,1546,11498,322,2598,1387,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,773,3483,6933,304,1371,5649,4280,22001,29892,541,472,3064,278,7309,800,4459,2428,29888,5611,470,10225,292,297,10809,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,10230,310,2598,1387,29915,29879,13206,21337,304,376,493,681,29908,322,376,7728,374,28141,4292,3783,29908,338,451,8072,10824,29892,10124,278,13254,1728,263,2821,8004,310,1438,4958,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,727,526,777,19462,988,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,470,7542,2450,29892,1316,408,746,24232,278,6964,310,376,2571,802,25482,744,29908,470,376,721,1545,545,12912,680,19950,874,1821,1213,5806,278,25657,947,1009,1900,304,21092,1438,22001,29892,896,1033,14169,515,4340,8252,304,8072,7602,1239,278,13254,310,1009,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,1532,29899,6144,2147,287,322,4780,304,1101,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,13173,304,8072,7602,1239,278,13254,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,29889],"total_duration":61268013020,"load_duration":157300,"prompt_eval_count":282,"prompt_eval_duration":25984292000,"eval_count":279,"eval_duration":35283053000}
