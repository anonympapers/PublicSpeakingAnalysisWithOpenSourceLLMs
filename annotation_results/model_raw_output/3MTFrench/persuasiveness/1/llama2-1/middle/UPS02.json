{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T15:09:22.778308381Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does provide some reasoning and evidence to support their claims, but there are also some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that the speaker provides a clear and concise explanation of their research topic, using simple language that is easy for the audience to understand. They also offer some interesting insights into the relationship between the fissure and the environment, which could be further explored in future sessions.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the argument could be improved. For example, the speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or data to support their claims, which makes it difficult for the audience to fully understand the magnitude of the issue. Additionally, the speaker's use of hyperbole and exaggerated language (e.g. \"il faut plonger au coeur de la mati√®re\") can come across as overly dramatic and may undermine the credibility of their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in their line of reasoning, they could benefit from further development and refinement of their argument to make it more persuasive and convincing to their audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,260,29915,267,301,29915,13453,3837,2265,610,301,29915,21813,17239,439,29915,309,427,6282,29889,478,681,454,1841,510,558,26477,1577,2581,26099,11643,1189,434,553,285,790,1973,29889,9353,966,5730,5908,4771,316,11643,5458,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,12866,818,1487,12377,749,29889,315,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,1671,1597,260,8284,316,285,790,1973,904,339,2561,5326,818,301,29915,6430,1759,344,332,270,29915,348,818,17256,923,345,1314,29889,6803,18729,29892,1444,2181,1318,1597,22577,285,790,545,29892,7847,1444,3911,623,3780,712,553,5855,17899,5056,316,2257,439,29915,1808,2947,1014,381,7628,316,1487,12377,749,634,1444,14111,1487,20299,882,818,425,260,8284,594,352,371,29889,2581,1236,1314,8532,29550,381,443,619,264,2637,966,9201,611,30058,509,9230,634,1487,20299,882,818,1597,10098,594,352,371,29889,11948,4191,7890,7890,427,270,2663,29920,29892,301,29915,23578,749,302,29915,342,2331,454,20536,2114,5411,1750,1437,8489,457,425,285,790,545,712,301,29915,265,15210,29889,951,22591,1465,27612,24145,285,790,545,707,1700,29884,29892,2947,8648,11469,1597,13500,29889,7747,712,432,29915,9297,347,316,7199,9030,1465,966,7019,2925,10252,3794,29889,8748,1671,18729,29892,980,21668,715,549,261,782,1302,5411,316,425,1775,5289,18934,270,29915,29948,791,2853,966,24610,2637,966,12301,267,29889,438,1481,29892,1444,7890,1223,545,439,29915,309,21668,16454,9291,29915,30001,18916,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,3008,28230,270,29915,348,904,12324,29872,12812,1908,1671,3911,9073,9411,7015,4392,575,29889,951,29871,29945,26379,534,265,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,8128,263,2821,322,3022,895,8252,310,1009,5925,11261,29892,773,2560,4086,393,338,4780,363,278,20026,304,2274,29889,2688,884,5957,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,9443,1546,278,285,790,545,322,278,5177,29892,607,1033,367,4340,3902,4395,297,5434,21396,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,8072,2274,278,18497,310,278,2228,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,322,429,9921,630,4086,313,29872,29889,29887,29889,376,309,21668,715,549,261,782,1302,5411,316,425,1775,5289,1159,508,2041,4822,408,975,368,8541,2454,322,1122,563,837,457,278,6625,4127,310,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,1009,1196,310,24481,29892,896,1033,14169,515,4340,5849,322,2143,262,882,310,1009,2980,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,322,17953,3277,304,1009,20026,29889],"total_duration":62921498922,"load_duration":150108,"prompt_eval_count":320,"prompt_eval_duration":28927530000,"eval_count":270,"eval_duration":33993336000}
