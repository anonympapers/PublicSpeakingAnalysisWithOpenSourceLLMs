{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T06:28:34.281446109Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score the speech as a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker does present some valid points about the impact of climate change on biodiversity and the need for adaptive strategies, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's argument that \"la biodiversité réponds en changeant dans l'espace\" is not fully developed. While it is true that some species may move their ranges in response to changing climate conditions, this is not a universal response and many species are likely to be negatively affected by climate change. The speaker could have provided more evidence to support this claim.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's suggestion that \"si je ne peux pas bouger, tu n'as qu'à décalé une ta période d'activité\" is not a feasible solution for many species. Many animals have specific time-of-year breeding and migration patterns that are linked to environmental cues, such as temperature and day length. Changing the timing of these events could have unintended consequences on the overall ecosystem.\n\nFinally, while the speaker's use of humorous examples (e.g., \"le serpent chasse putard dans l'admille pour chopper des muleaux\") can make the speech more engaging and relatable, it also detracts from the overall message and makes it harder to take the speaker's arguments seriously.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid points about the impact of climate change on biodiversity, the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based. A score of 3 out of 5 is a fair reflection of the persuasiveness of this speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,897,301,29915,21871,7289,1224,966,7446,778,29892,432,29915,1794,6079,7199,275,29892,274,29915,342,454,10784,15819,8474,13386,634,269,29915,309,5246,14671,698,434,4595,277,29889,11948,1671,439,29915,309,343,263,443,274,2487,12154,29892,1444,7890,610,280,316,29871,4277,22572,29915,15669,1577,2581,7890,610,280,316,10784,271,29892,3503,26154,316,5694,19113,29892,7890,4078,29920,8164,29899,5474,712,454,10784,271,1735,634,712,966,8714,3435,1411,712,5246,425,289,2660,1536,2131,2258,30019,1300,1874,882,10784,15819,634,6079,29871,4277,1437,14081,1249,3999,5152,17893,29202,274,29915,342,8541,15819,29889,10016,1139,1671,10503,440,276,3440,534,8885,868,285,1007,1577,3872,29883,29892,16380,479,427,874,454,6218,29892,29871,4277,16933,11387,10329,566,18916,29899,6500,29889,8748,1354,425,8861,553,25179,787,267,1735,29920,316,2058,29892,425,289,2660,1536,2131,25497,29879,427,1735,424,1465,301,29915,267,3535,29892,3503,3440,1444,16623,1577,6101,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,289,692,261,29892,5291,302,29915,294,439,29915,30001,1437,1052,29948,1597,11062,18108,270,29915,11236,2131,29892,425,1766,14817,29892,610,17488,29892,16623,29899,29879,267,21038,28185,9373,29892,454,724,22825,521,5793,1925,538,1465,301,29915,328,29885,1924,1671,3060,2496,553,286,1297,2993,29889,8748,274,29915,342,425,18768,553,25179,787,267,782,1841,1173,29888,882,29889,997,289,2660,1536,2131,25497,29879,427,1735,424,1465,454,8714,29889,2581,1236,1314,6079,2970,454,16053,479,29899,29887,3890,29892,3503,2970,443,534,1682,1750,286,29915,29926,29915,29874,603,29892,611,18108,270,29915,11236,2131,29892,946,5705,1318,316,425,289,2660,1536,2131,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,2854,3291,1048,278,10879,310,23622,1735,373,289,2660,24974,322,278,817,363,7744,573,16650,583,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,376,433,289,2660,1536,2131,25497,29879,427,1735,424,1465,301,29915,267,3535,29908,338,451,8072,8906,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,777,6606,1122,4337,1009,20238,297,2933,304,6480,23622,5855,29892,445,338,451,263,15968,2933,322,1784,6606,526,5517,304,367,3480,6703,15201,491,23622,1735,29889,450,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,8998,393,376,1039,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,289,692,261,29892,5291,302,29915,294,439,29915,30001,1437,1052,29948,1597,11062,18108,270,29915,11236,2131,29908,338,451,263,28326,1821,1650,363,1784,6606,29889,9267,15006,505,2702,931,29899,974,29899,6360,2078,21219,322,20332,15038,393,526,9024,304,29380,274,1041,29892,1316,408,10430,322,2462,3309,29889,678,9776,278,28750,310,1438,4959,1033,505,443,524,2760,27721,373,278,12463,321,3944,973,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,3165,20657,6455,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,280,724,22825,521,5793,1925,538,1465,301,29915,328,29885,1924,1671,3060,2496,553,286,1297,2993,1159,508,1207,278,12032,901,3033,6751,322,1104,17219,29892,372,884,1439,1461,29879,515,278,12463,2643,322,3732,372,22622,304,2125,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,25798,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,278,10879,310,23622,1735,373,289,2660,24974,29892,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,338,263,6534,17842,310,278,20408,294,20193,310,445,12032,29889],"total_duration":80056954728,"load_duration":154602,"prompt_eval_count":330,"prompt_eval_duration":30388269000,"eval_count":385,"eval_duration":49668070000}
