{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T15:24:18.932956401Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 2 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker is not very effective in crafting a convincing message and their reasoning is not rigorous. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes several claims without providing any evidence to support them. For example, they mention that the plasma column will stretch over a hundred meters, but they don't provide any data or scientific studies to back this up.\n2. Unclear logic: The speaker's argument relies heavily on analogies and hypothetical scenarios, which can be confusing and difficult to follow. For example, their comparison of the charged and critical particles to humans is not clear and does not add any logical reasoning to the argument.\n3. Lack of clarity: The speaker's message is not clearly conveyed throughout the transcript. They jump between different topics and ideas without providing a clear explanation or conclusion.\n4. Unconvincing tone: The speaker's tone comes across as dismissive and unprofessional, which can be off-putting to the audience. For example, their statement \"Ok, oui, vous allez vous y pr√©cipiter\" (Ok, yes, you will rush there) sounds more like a command than an invitation to listen to their argument.\n\nOverall, the speaker could benefit from providing more evidence and logical reasoning to support their claims, as well as clarifying their message and tone to make it more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,13382,29892,9484,424,1597,784,7293,316,715,25392,29892,1671,427,269,29915,1893,9030,818,2298,270,29915,1540,1644,9874,316,22609,29889,7747,715,25392,29892,6896,352,10120,427,443,18643,270,29915,1466,269,2736,663,29892,2535,19601,316,521,15806,28262,550,29889,951,13659,2535,966,1437,25389,267,29889,382,29882,6079,29892,274,29915,342,712,966,9151,743,634,2181,1199,3435,443,7006,4191,8556,29889,11001,267,592,302,29915,609,2331,904,386,13716,417,17851,610,346,439,29915,309,263,19398,4875,634,26154,20554,3435,28602,9230,29889,3872,29883,29892,14034,29920,29899,23088,29892,439,29915,265,263,4224,24969,270,29915,264,1437,29890,3222,424,8532,712,7890,29871,22730,3965,29948,29892,3669,1145,882,29892,439,29915,1808,640,533,818,425,503,10651,634,7774,424,425,4655,2131,553,24722,1973,1190,425,992,347,270,29915,5753,30069,6772,29889,478,681,4788,29920,7890,343,7175,7334,1524,29892,1661,29973,3674,29892,2123,29875,29892,7890,4788,29920,7890,343,7175,7334,1524,29889,8748,966,9151,743,634,2181,1199,316,301,29915,6022,22819,743,1465,6267,4948,482,29892,373,5246,316,6701,409,7175,7334,1524,1465,425,5305,712,1444,6267,18332,29892,18097,1444,6267,18332,29889,8748,1354,18729,707,5246,29892,274,29915,342,610,29888,1249,29889,478,681,7890,364,26477,301,4564,29948,425,285,2736,276,21975,439,29915,1808,707,22847,29889,365,30001,6722,7890,28078,11867,29892,316,7175,9625,443,1095,15164,27799,492,316,2117,371,1295,634,26154,301,29915,3451,30037,4630,316,260,7202,1190,966,20542,818,410,6772,914,29889,11948,1444,3516,575,270,29915,4422,7608,454,4195,9139,29892,7890,263,545,29920,1083,279,17851,29889,1704,270,29915,24430,29892,7890,4788,29920,316,7869,1274,13300,357,316,27962,7732,6063,2535,19601,818,29231,5495,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,1354,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,338,451,1407,11828,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,322,1009,24481,338,451,12912,20657,29889,2266,526,777,9590,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,3196,16726,1728,13138,738,10757,304,2304,963,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,278,715,25392,1897,674,16116,975,263,6893,27881,29892,541,896,1016,29915,29873,3867,738,848,470,16021,11898,304,1250,445,701,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,5900,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,15690,583,322,13752,300,936,21846,29892,607,508,367,16051,322,5189,304,1101,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,10230,310,278,20139,322,12187,17105,304,25618,338,451,2821,322,947,451,788,738,16667,24481,304,278,2980,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,9436,27769,287,10106,278,1301,924,29889,2688,12500,1546,1422,23820,322,7014,1728,13138,263,2821,8252,470,15997,29889,13,29946,29889,853,535,3845,3277,16225,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,16225,5304,4822,408,18918,573,322,443,23221,15750,29892,607,508,367,1283,29899,649,1259,304,278,20026,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,3229,376,20434,29892,2123,29875,29892,7890,4788,29920,7890,343,7175,7334,1524,29908,313,20434,29892,4874,29892,366,674,364,1878,727,29897,10083,901,763,263,1899,1135,385,2437,7018,304,11621,304,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,1033,14169,515,13138,901,10757,322,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,408,1532,408,7542,9215,1009,2643,322,16225,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":75066535764,"load_duration":237699,"prompt_eval_count":358,"prompt_eval_duration":32590528000,"eval_count":329,"eval_duration":42475182000}
