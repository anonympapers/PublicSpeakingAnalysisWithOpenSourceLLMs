The speaker provides some interesting observations and examples to support their argument that larger organisms are better equipped to handle hot temperatures, but their reasoning is not entirely rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker makes a general observation about the relationship between temperature and body size without providing any scientific evidence or explanation for why this should be the case. They simply state that \"it's like that\" without offering any further insight.\n\nSecondly, the speaker provides an example of how a large animal, such as a polar bear, is able to survive in a cold climate despite being larger than its smaller cousin. However, this example does not necessarily support the speaker's broader argument about the advantages of being larger in hot climates. For instance, polar bears are well-adapted to their Arctic environment and have evolved specialized features such as thick fur and blubber to keep warm, which has nothing to do with their size.\n\nFinally, the speaker makes a vague reference to \"experiments\" and \"physics\" without providing any specific details or evidence to support their claims. This lack of rigor in the reasoning undermines the persuasiveness of the speech as a whole.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's observation about the relationship between temperature and body size is intriguing, their argument is not fully developed or supported by empirical evidence, which limits its persuasive power.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,853,8694,29892,373,1083,19862,1249,712,18916,6722,980,5246,10329,566,29892,443,13019,18916,2362,707,18484,11387,26379,29892,18484,14255,966,409,29894,834,2993,2123,10440,14255,966,286,4850,361,5908,29892,544,10281,29899,29885,30037,4467,610,17488,443,3036,346,16755,29889,13704,1354,707,2298,26379,712,1487,22618,427,4439,328,347,29892,29871,4277,274,29915,342,443,17488,17541,5093,3503,29871,4277,1766,1173,29871,1654,29892,443,16053,479,330,3890,623,598,309,29892,6722,980,5246,443,17887,263,680,29892,16933,11387,26379,712,1487,15243,2245,309,343,263,316,425,9460,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,1597,28974,316,7175,7316,8474,966,480,1037,332,275,634,425,364,30000,6234,316,9827,1171,29892,427,4768,21317,19913,29892,980,6309,712,966,22114,17161,296,6628,1314,425,521,744,332,712,966,5697,1169,29889,3872,29883,29892,980,5246,10329,566,712,5291,831,9201,26379,7013,6386,1597,11266,8489,347,29889,435,29915,264,7468,5246,301,29915,4548,4894,663,29892,260,993,2331,2298,11364,439,29915,29882,631,29892,611,260,5793,316,3209,29892,19431,339,309,782,3023,29881,1387,29892,454,325,568,712,425,3209,285,5289,29889,3872,29883,29892,553,21206,6916,1840,3783,29892,18916,1444,7890,610,280,316,4824,1387,29892,3503,980,19947,5695,553,2114,11620,4768,1189,3783,29892,1465,454,6218,29892,18097,301,14069,2656,29892,980,5246,443,14671,275,269,5903,1908,29889,1720,343,263,2298,270,29915,348,4249,29948,29892,12866,5291,592,1295,427,298,2147,29892,3503,1354,5291,831,2298,4595,29892,5291,408,2298,316,1841,643,1960,29892,8164,29899,5474,712,425,5291,10503,440,276,29892,12866,10440,29892,634,5291,452,29758,316,15243,9080,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,13917,322,6455,304,2304,1009,2980,393,7200,2894,12903,526,2253,1592,16242,304,4386,7375,6238,3698,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,9186,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,3732,263,2498,15500,1048,278,9443,1546,10430,322,3573,2159,1728,13138,738,16021,10757,470,8252,363,2020,445,881,367,278,1206,29889,2688,3763,2106,393,376,277,29915,29879,763,393,29908,1728,27032,738,4340,25483,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,8128,385,1342,310,920,263,2919,13019,29892,1316,408,263,16755,11460,29892,338,2221,304,10503,573,297,263,11220,23622,15020,1641,7200,1135,967,7968,22618,29889,2398,29892,445,1342,947,451,12695,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,2545,1664,2980,1048,278,25486,310,1641,7200,297,7375,10784,1078,29889,1152,2777,29892,16755,367,1503,526,1532,29899,1114,415,287,304,1009,826,20009,5177,322,505,15220,1490,4266,1891,5680,1316,408,12003,3261,322,1999,431,495,304,3013,14294,29892,607,756,3078,304,437,411,1009,2159,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,3732,263,25160,3407,304,376,735,546,7862,29908,322,376,25105,29908,1728,13138,738,2702,4902,470,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,10225,310,12912,272,297,278,24481,563,837,1475,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,408,263,3353,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,15500,1048,278,9443,1546,10430,322,3573,2159,338,11158,5526,292,29892,1009,2980,338,451,8072,8906,470,6969,491,29190,936,10757,29892,607,13071,967,20408,294,573,3081,29889],"total_duration":72230460073,"load_duration":178763,"prompt_eval_count":332,"prompt_eval_duration":30617249000,"eval_count":327,"eval_duration":41612545000}
