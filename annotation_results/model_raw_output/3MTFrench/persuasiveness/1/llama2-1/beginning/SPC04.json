{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T19:44:47.363659042Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker is able to effectively use rhetorical devices and provide examples to support their argument, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker uses a personal anecdote to engage the audience and establishes a sense of relatability by mentioning that they too have struggled with finding the right size for their body. However, the argument could benefit from more logical coherence and clarity in some parts. For example, the concept of \"Ayrén\" and \"Réve\" is not fully explained, and it is unclear how these terms relate to the overall message of the speech. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make it difficult for the audience to follow the speaker's train of thought.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in using rhetorical devices and providing examples, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and clear in order to make a stronger argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2123,21206,538,261,29889,2661,29899,346,712,29871,4277,7890,12468,1808,21907,12784,1577,1459,346,712,7890,5695,7890,8992,29920,6898,16555,818,454,534,8885,454,701,303,7121,29892,2535,872,1766,2172,1908,634,1487,10814,1089,27537,479,1190,425,17949,29889,1459,346,712,19601,29892,23272,882,432,29915,28899,275,286,585,1564,275,29889,8748,1671,29873,424,29892,432,29915,1794,8121,29948,10440,29889,317,4987,712,22572,29915,15669,29892,1601,521,538,275,29892,980,269,29915,932,1808,319,4316,1690,29892,319,1270,29881,29892,27461,6718,29892,1570,28746,29889,478,681,17043,5582,29920,7209,270,2663,425,360,1690,29892,5278,1601,4582,1297,1750,640,993,443,2472,1750,11482,2344,26814,260,8284,29892,26814,3581,20519,316,1236,585,29889,997,319,4316,1690,1671,9073,2560,29892,274,29915,342,454,501,495,29892,274,29915,342,454,8818,29875,1465,325,359,3038,2540,29889,1720,1301,13732,5278,2472,1671,439,29915,1808,2653,5582,7848,1020,1524,29889,997,319,4316,1690,29892,7890,427,8992,29920,1465,14984,325,359,3038,2540,5898,28374,883,267,29889,8748,425,5027,345,712,4439,28661,22527,29202,29892,553,26278,818,6056,2122,13417,275,296,818,425,3681,4107,29899,2772,4989,345,1136,29948,3910,29889,751,392,274,29915,342,11266,260,2673,1616,4745,29892,4875,707,1437,1727,944,29889,1720,21668,12866,15882,425,3681,4107,29899,2772,10750,4582,1297,29892,3104,296,18029,302,29915,342,5172,29892,10042,439,29915,348,2779,316,5646,26814,2894,6386,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,20283,29892,980,707,274,496,29948,782,22591,270,29915,1540,12584,280,29403,29892,5695,13483,712,966,23093,521,12387,29892,634,1399,7081,29889,8748,1120,424,7890,2970,29892,29871,4277,5246,868,9122,29889,1704,1465,7814,3038,2540,29892,425,319,4316,1690,3911,302,29915,609,2298,29892,980,302,29915,342,2331,5646,20536,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,671,364,9188,272,936,9224,322,3867,6455,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3913,263,7333,385,687,29881,866,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,10127,267,263,4060,310,1104,271,3097,491,3585,292,393,896,2086,505,10205,839,411,9138,278,1492,2159,363,1009,3573,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,14169,515,901,16667,16165,261,663,322,7542,537,297,777,5633,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,6964,310,376,29909,4316,1690,29908,322,376,29934,29948,345,29908,338,451,8072,10824,29892,322,372,338,20871,920,1438,4958,29279,304,278,12463,2643,310,278,12032,29889,19814,29892,777,310,278,25260,526,3755,1472,322,378,1555,3860,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,773,364,9188,272,936,9224,322,13138,6455,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,2821,297,1797,304,1207,263,23505,2980,29889],"total_duration":63100051529,"load_duration":165674,"prompt_eval_count":364,"prompt_eval_duration":32957117000,"eval_count":238,"eval_duration":30142262000}
