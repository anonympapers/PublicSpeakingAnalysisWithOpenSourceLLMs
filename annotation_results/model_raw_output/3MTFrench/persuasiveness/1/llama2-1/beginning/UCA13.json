{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T22:48:37.218496607Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker's message is not particularly convincing or well-reasoned, and they rely heavily on vague promises and empty phrases without providing any concrete evidence or logical arguments to support their claims.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is not rigorous, and they often resort to fallacies such as appeals to emotion (e.g., \"Sometimes sometimes even we close on we don't even come to the world but it'll cause you because those are the ones of us the world of the world\") or unrelated examples (e.g., \"Play Cordy, that I and even one year in a possible case\"). They also use repetitive phrases such as \"я не знаю\" (I don't know) and \" что я не знаю\" (what I don't know), which can come across as unprepared or unconfident.\n\nOverall, the speaker's message is not persuasive enough to convince the audience of their claims, and they could benefit from providing more concrete evidence and logical arguments to support their views.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6061,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,606,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,8709,292,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,8573,302,5512,24032,631,30641,30641,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,443,2786,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,1077,26831,29970,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,13074,853,8485,406,264,29892,4281,2282,7412,20893,29891,29892,4281,2282,606,1538,6253,30005,29892,4281,2282,3574,1498,15515,10477,490,28461,2815,23334,29919,29889,18512,6041,1584,591,3802,373,591,1016,29915,29873,1584,2041,304,278,3186,541,372,29915,645,4556,366,1363,1906,526,278,6743,310,502,278,3186,310,278,3186,29889,30665,30364,8082,29871,239,154,183,4449,3029,232,176,172,29889,8616,23674,29932,29892,531,1843,1325,1782,382,5990,29889,665,8160,642,5524,239,163,139,10502,29892,10835,469,1930,29957,1499,717,6517,606,6414,29981,29872,1335,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,10734,17953,3277,470,1532,29899,23147,287,29892,322,896,19104,20365,373,25160,27584,322,4069,12216,2129,1728,13138,738,18387,10757,470,16667,6273,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,12912,20657,29892,322,896,4049,25362,304,285,9864,2478,1316,408,5929,1338,304,953,8194,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,29903,14618,6041,1584,591,3802,373,591,1016,29915,29873,1584,2041,304,278,3186,541,372,29915,645,4556,366,1363,1906,526,278,6743,310,502,278,3186,310,278,3186,1159,470,443,12817,6455,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,13454,20893,29891,29892,393,306,322,1584,697,1629,297,263,1950,1206,2564,2688,884,671,21159,3321,12216,2129,1316,408,376,29970,1538,6253,30005,29908,313,29902,1016,29915,29873,1073,29897,322,376,4281,2282,1538,6253,30005,29908,313,5816,306,1016,29915,29873,1073,511,607,508,2041,4822,408,443,15287,1965,470,443,5527,1693,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,20408,294,573,3307,304,7602,1239,278,20026,310,1009,16726,29892,322,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,18387,10757,322,16667,6273,304,2304,1009,8386,29889],"total_duration":78924278149,"load_duration":307804,"prompt_eval_count":497,"prompt_eval_duration":45492335000,"eval_count":257,"eval_duration":33431003000}
