{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T17:48:29.30750894Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give the speech a score of 3 out of 5 on the persuasiveness scale. The speaker does a good job of using rhetorical devices such as repetition and metaphors to make their message more engaging and memorable. However, the reasoning presented is not particularly rigorous or well-supported by evidence.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that the insecticide \"clore des connes\" has been used for over 20 years and has led to pollution that will last for \"several hundred years.\" While this may be a concerning issue, the speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or data to support their claim. Additionally, the speaker relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and personal experience, rather than objective facts and figures.\n\nOverall, while the speech is somewhat persuasive due to its use of rhetorical devices, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based arguments.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,6303,1597,10098,29892,7732,5697,1169,1302,305,787,29889,365,29915,555,13533,6303,1354,24571,12675,29892,439,29915,1808,452,24684,1249,2298,966,904,2608,29948,29889,838,943,980,760,631,316,425,22577,521,290,5289,29892,634,521,562,348,553,7732,1302,305,787,409,1380,818,6787,533,872,26138,18234,29889,10016,953,412,1924,29892,1597,953,915,29884,1924,634,1597,953,1030,1924,29889,951,301,1132,538,270,29915,524,328,18949,29884,533,966,4239,3503,787,5246,267,316,3300,5495,316,23734,29892,20536,425,18234,953,1030,1387,3105,904,862,5138,1318,29889,4241,841,424,29892,6382,4983,7814,7732,5697,1169,1302,305,787,3479,875,4285,29889,24337,7017,1302,305,265,6303,454,325,819,427,5644,262,4799,1190,1597,20067,1808,270,29915,2276,915,29889,315,29915,342,24145,1302,305,265,634,980,343,263,1597,18234,316,3300,7545,29889,951,18768,3911,6303,454,12491,427,5644,262,4799,10641,29948,443,286,2375,631,29889,1720,263,1597,18234,316,23734,29889,951,22448,6303,454,12491,1465,553,21592,7862,270,29915,295,29894,482,29892,7209,11469,18413,1035,2093,818,301,29915,1062,14508,1465,1597,18234,316,289,9216,29889,306,455,29892,24145,4595,8774,13775,301,1132,29892,274,29915,342,425,1067,487,553,378,4515,29889,997,1067,487,553,378,4515,707,443,17564,293,680,1750,263,4370,28643,3479,875,4285,1671,301,6463,8474,443,27710,482,332,868,9892,273,2035,29889,26219,439,29915,2719,3435,1006,29881,1169,8997,2298,316,29871,29906,29900,6063,29892,1487,3667,4371,263,13417,277,1597,21180,918,1411,519,553,409,7273,1671,10741,1644,13116,270,29915,812,2406,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,278,12032,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,6287,29889,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,773,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,1539,12451,943,304,1207,1009,2643,901,3033,6751,322,26959,519,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,9132,338,451,10734,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,17564,293,680,376,695,487,553,378,4515,29908,756,1063,1304,363,975,29871,29906,29900,2440,322,756,5331,304,21180,918,393,674,1833,363,376,344,369,284,6893,2440,1213,5806,445,1122,367,263,19813,2228,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,337,3687,20365,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,7271,29892,3265,1135,12091,17099,322,13994,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,10579,20408,294,573,2861,304,967,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,6273,29889],"total_duration":53002392841,"load_duration":170771,"prompt_eval_count":322,"prompt_eval_duration":27261241000,"eval_count":211,"eval_duration":25740421000}
