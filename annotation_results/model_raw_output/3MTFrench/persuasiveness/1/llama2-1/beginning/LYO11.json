{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T08:50:05.065626243Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and uses relatable analogies to explain their points. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that the nerves in the feet are like journalists from BFMTV is an interesting analogy, but it could be further developed to provide a clearer picture of how the nerves function. Additionally, the explanation of the cause of neuropathy as \"too much sugar in the blood\" is oversimplified and doesn't fully capture the complexities of the condition.\n\nFurthermore, the speaker's assertion that people with diabetes often have a deep wound in their foot that they can't explain is not well-supported by evidence. While diabetes can cause nerve damage and increase the risk of foot problems, there are many other factors that can contribute to the development of neuropathy, such as genetics, age, and lifestyle choices.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling arguments, their reasoning could benefit from more depth and rigor in certain areas.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,592,5814,5893,818,7890,2257,29627,29892,1444,592,26099,16987,782,3184,29871,29941,29900,6063,29889,435,29915,326,1004,553,5969,787,29889,435,29915,326,1004,443,301,1132,631,29889,7747,3435,966,26033,5847,1465,425,282,30069,311,286,6430,631,29892,1750,263,427,18644,29948,454,2643,316,425,4662,20519,9291,29915,30001,1601,5147,345,585,29889,8748,7890,29892,966,3440,454,15373,30085,29892,980,263,7006,270,545,29889,7747,3435,966,26033,5847,1465,425,282,30069,311,325,359,285,15322,1750,7890,454,766,296,29889,12390,26033,5847,3435,4191,553,8955,9230,316,350,22192,8050,1750,8556,1871,424,9410,663,316,2257,1750,409,21714,26269,316,8556,29889,341,514,276,22527,29892,3058,267,18554,8556,2414,794,2298,301,29915,19678,29889,951,332,26033,5847,3435,443,7006,1437,699,29886,1169,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,452,4131,493,29891,29889,1720,20423,11469,443,5777,453,327,1465,425,521,11214,545,634,452,6701,2331,427,1083,609,16731,29889,997,4556,316,7015,452,4131,493,29891,29892,454,652,370,12973,29892,5646,409,480,1037,1465,454,13625,1750,2923,1509,1465,454,14913,9291,29915,30001,425,282,30069,311,29892,1559,336,3503,301,29915,29882,1478,333,403,818,17887,301,29915,29948,1089,345,29889,8748,7015,18554,1750,4625,868,652,370,12973,29889,8748,1597,6032,9474,4625,427,2298,6079,18484,443,318,280,29899,29879,1908,29892,1597,2174,347,2600,13469,1465,425,282,30069,311,1750,452,269,29915,29891,439,986,296,818,534,625,2331,6079,29889,1551,452,872,277,2331,1671,339,7768,29889,8748,1354,373,452,26939,2331,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,1104,17219,15690,583,304,5649,1009,3291,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,278,302,20098,297,278,6900,526,763,8955,2879,515,350,22192,8050,338,385,8031,3483,6933,29892,541,372,1033,367,4340,8906,304,3867,263,26135,7623,310,920,278,302,20098,740,29889,19814,29892,278,8252,310,278,4556,310,452,4131,493,29891,408,376,517,29877,1568,26438,297,278,10416,29908,338,288,874,13699,2164,322,1838,29915,29873,8072,10446,278,4280,1907,310,278,4195,29889,13,13,29943,332,721,5514,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,2305,411,652,370,10778,4049,505,263,6483,281,618,297,1009,3661,393,896,508,29915,29873,5649,338,451,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29889,5806,652,370,10778,508,4556,302,7143,18658,322,7910,278,12045,310,3661,4828,29892,727,526,1784,916,13879,393,508,29126,304,278,5849,310,452,4131,493,29891,29892,1316,408,2531,300,1199,29892,5046,29892,322,301,7004,1508,19995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,752,7807,6273,29892,1009,24481,1033,14169,515,901,10809,322,12912,272,297,3058,10161,29889],"total_duration":64319079382,"load_duration":152225,"prompt_eval_count":320,"prompt_eval_duration":29431220000,"eval_count":275,"eval_duration":34887318000}
