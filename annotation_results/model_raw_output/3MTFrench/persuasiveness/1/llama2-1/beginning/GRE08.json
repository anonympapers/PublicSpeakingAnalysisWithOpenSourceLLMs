The speaker provides some interesting analogies and examples to illustrate their point about the complexity of maintaining the stability of molecules in the pharmaceutical industry, but there are some areas where they could improve their argumentation.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic to help the audience better understand the significance of the issue. For example, they could have explained why the stability of molecules is important in the first place, or how it affects the effectiveness of medications. Without this context, some listeners may find it difficult to fully appreciate the speaker's arguments.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker provides some interesting examples and analogies, they could have gone further in elaborating on these points to make their argument more convincing. For instance, they could have discussed how the complexity of maintaining molecular stability affects different stages of the pharmaceutical production process, such as research and development, manufacturing, and quality control. By providing more specific examples and details, the speaker could have made their argument more compelling and easier to follow.\n\nFinally, while the speaker acknowledges that there are challenges in maintaining molecular stability, they do not offer any clear solutions or recommendations for addressing these challenges. To make their argument more persuasive, the speaker could have provided some potential strategies or recommendations for improving the stability of molecules in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the complexity of maintaining molecular stability in the pharmaceutical industry, they could improve their argumentation by providing more context and details to support their points.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,452,872,275,2331,1354,7890,4078,29920,29892,19601,1444,301,29915,1794,623,3780,427,7175,862,424,1601,2313,2470,316,5278,21824,1318,29892,3503,5278,16549,316,521,5793,332,270,29915,8284,1295,19601,29892,269,29915,932,1808,443,10636,3893,434,29889,7747,16151,316,301,29915,15693,918,29892,980,302,29915,264,19947,1465,9411,966,9744,29892,1465,14984,966,6361,1041,29889,11001,267,4625,12563,425,6701,3153,2131,29889,315,29915,342,316,1702,13639,25235,2258,21873,818,22272,782,7017,633,536,29892,3503,270,29915,5474,16530,20564,2923,25123,818,11504,265,2265,818,782,316,7869,29889,2581,592,26099,7697,29884,16731,712,2257,6964,24684,1249,409,12468,307,4630,316,480,29891,553,10283,293,20060,29889,478,681,343,8992,29920,2331,454,13659,29892,1444,7890,1518,28378,1572,29875,1671,339,7768,29889,19551,802,373,707,4439,1943,29892,373,16067,24145,10283,293,1166,29892,373,301,29915,29874,1597,21753,29892,297,283,30019,424,29892,634,373,8164,2145,2853,454,9587,316,7814,6664,583,22024,339,309,944,2258,21873,29889,11948,29202,301,29915,264,874,868,1437,2616,707,21394,2298,4280,29872,29889,1704,454,2298,18484,29892,966,21136,1379,437,27649,9073,3700,818,316,25226,427,1324,1314,634,13214,454,1667,29873,819,316,425,16160,2131,553,6062,29948,21337,1750,325,609,7848,1437,17843,5606,3479,22069,29889,2581,592,10484,276,2298,16530,20564,1190,443,1134,316,6062,29948,21337,29892,966,3677,293,555,267,7814,1067,2873,29889,2664,3677,293,555,267,29892,274,29915,342,6094,616,29889,6803,339,7768,1577,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,15690,583,322,6455,304,28475,1009,1298,1048,278,13644,310,7344,292,278,25806,310,13206,21337,297,278,1374,22824,346,329,936,13661,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,304,1371,278,20026,2253,2274,278,26002,310,278,2228,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,10824,2020,278,25806,310,13206,21337,338,4100,297,278,937,2058,29892,470,920,372,6602,29879,278,2779,20193,310,13589,800,29889,13932,445,3030,29892,777,11621,414,1122,1284,372,5189,304,8072,11188,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,6455,322,15690,583,29892,896,1033,505,7695,4340,297,13771,1218,373,1438,3291,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,1033,505,15648,920,278,13644,310,7344,292,13206,16637,25806,6602,29879,1422,22950,310,278,1374,22824,346,329,936,5802,1889,29892,1316,408,5925,322,5849,29892,12012,3864,29892,322,11029,2761,29889,2648,13138,901,2702,6455,322,4902,29892,278,25657,1033,505,1754,1009,2980,901,752,7807,322,6775,304,1101,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,1550,278,25657,24084,2710,393,727,526,18066,267,297,7344,292,13206,16637,25806,29892,896,437,451,5957,738,2821,6851,470,6907,800,363,3211,292,1438,18066,267,29889,1763,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,777,7037,16650,583,470,6907,800,363,4857,1747,278,25806,310,13206,21337,297,278,1374,22824,346,329,936,13661,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,13644,310,7344,292,13206,16637,25806,297,278,1374,22824,346,329,936,13661,29892,896,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,491,13138,901,3030,322,4902,304,2304,1009,3291,29889],"total_duration":78132686401,"load_duration":153787,"prompt_eval_count":306,"prompt_eval_duration":28096360000,"eval_count":389,"eval_duration":50035746000}
