{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T22:53:35.695682649Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker seems to be using repetition and rhyme to emphasize their message, but the arguments presented are somewhat simplistic and lack concrete evidence or logical proof.\n\nThe speaker is primarily relying on emotional appeals and personal anecdotes to make their case, rather than providing a rigorous analysis of the issue at hand. While the speaker's passion and conviction are evident, they do not offer any compelling reasons why the listener should accept their argument. The use of phrases such as \"if there are things wrong\" and \"but if there are things不好\" suggests a lack of clarity and precision in the speaker's thinking.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's emphasis on the need for the listener to \"put the ritual on\" and \"find the people\" feels somewhat nonsensical and unsupported by any concrete evidence. The use of the phrase \"he probably coughs on the most of the harder weight!\" is also unclear and could be seen as a non sequitur in the context of the speech.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's enthusiasm and conviction are admirable, the lack of rigorous reasoning and evidence detracts from the persuasiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,3115,29892,565,366,1925,278,3353,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,11509,304,437,445,29889,960,727,338,263,1108,29892,366,508,29915,29873,679,964,278,3186,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,1126,769,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,366,29915,645,1284,278,2305,29889,1205,565,727,526,2712,30413,31076,29892,769,278,916,2022,29915,29879,5192,674,1284,278,2305,29889,960,366,1925,278,10421,950,373,29892,565,727,526,2712,2743,29892,769,596,5192,674,367,10423,29889,2193,746,727,29915,29879,263,2022,1058,1838,29915,29873,23819,3099,29892,322,540,1838,29915,29873,4459,3099,29889,1987,670,5192,1818,367,540,7943,1728,7291,393,1749,10614,508,29915,29873,29889,960,540,3965,30666,233,181,188,451,1363,310,599,278,23633,29892,769,596,20961,271,2113,29915,29873,24738,29889,960,372,4947,975,29892,278,3748,2113,29915,29873,1207,372,15029,29892,1363,1749,6567,2113,29915,29873,6023,278,1449,29889,450,2769,393,372,1716,414,278,2022,338,393,940,3117,274,820,29879,373,278,30567,278,1556,310,278,22622,7688,29991,4266,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,2444,304,367,773,21159,654,322,18178,25395,304,19310,675,1009,2643,29892,541,278,6273,9132,526,10579,5466,4695,322,10225,18387,10757,470,16667,5296,29889,13,13,1576,25657,338,19434,337,5890,373,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,7333,385,687,29881,4769,304,1207,1009,1206,29892,3265,1135,13138,263,12912,20657,7418,310,278,2228,472,1361,29889,5806,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,7602,2463,526,13602,29892,896,437,451,5957,738,752,7807,9590,2020,278,13254,881,3544,1009,2980,29889,450,671,310,12216,2129,1316,408,376,361,727,526,2712,2743,29908,322,376,4187,565,727,526,2712,30413,31076,29908,14661,263,10225,310,7542,537,322,16716,297,278,25657,29915,29879,7291,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,19310,275,373,278,817,363,278,13254,304,376,649,278,10421,950,373,29908,322,376,2886,278,2305,29908,23880,10579,302,787,575,936,322,443,23765,491,738,18387,10757,29889,450,671,310,278,16549,376,354,3117,274,820,29879,373,278,1556,310,278,22622,7688,3850,338,884,20871,322,1033,367,3595,408,263,1661,8617,277,332,297,278,3030,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,322,7602,2463,526,594,2460,18104,29892,278,10225,310,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,1439,1461,29879,515,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":60375862969,"load_duration":152558,"prompt_eval_count":263,"prompt_eval_duration":23550890000,"eval_count":296,"eval_duration":36824324000}
