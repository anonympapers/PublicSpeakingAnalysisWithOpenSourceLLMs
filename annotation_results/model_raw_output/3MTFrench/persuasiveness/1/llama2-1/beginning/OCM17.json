{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T00:55:48.515004769Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and repetition to emphasize their point, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by making a personal connection with the audience by sharing their own experience of gaining weight during their thesis. This helps to establish a sense of relatability and authenticity, which is important for persuading the audience. However, the speaker then introduces a somewhat tangential point about the regulation of plant growth cycles, which detracts from the main message they are trying to convey.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous in terms of providing evidence and logical arguments to support their claims. For example, they mention that they have taken 8 kilos in 16 months, but they do not provide any data or studies to back up this claim. This lack of evidence makes it difficult for the audience to fully understand the speaker's message and assess its persuasiveness.\n\nOverall, while the speaker uses some effective rhetorical devices, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported to make the argument more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,4241,841,424,439,29915,265,707,443,17887,419,2131,29892,980,25810,26842,404,424,1671,19601,316,7890,11469,21907,12784,29889,28266,712,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,425,266,17449,29892,432,29915,1794,19445,13545,4679,359,29889,29871,29947,4679,359,29889,29871,29947,4679,359,29889,435,29915,1794,19445,29871,29947,4679,359,427,29871,29896,29953,17478,316,266,17449,29889,853,2407,29889,997,266,17449,263,13162,23855,882,1437,1727,29880,1318,611,2258,15529,316,4439,2073,1318,29889,12660,1727,1358,29889,7747,3184,707,17541,19553,882,4100,1559,2123,29875,29889,405,681,29892,7890,24894,29892,8556,1047,4467,6367,1358,29892,6367,1358,1671,286,4600,443,3058,1424,29948,3910,29889,405,681,767,479,787,454,1775,262,29892,454,7145,29875,634,454,29627,29889,1174,11172,712,316,301,29915,29949,29887,275,478,2445,1893,744,29892,1444,592,18593,425,1139,316,4048,6390,1354,274,29915,342,7814,1757,2406,760,351,2406,610,270,29915,14559,2894,1608,267,29889,2216,10460,966,715,3794,29889,2661,29899,346,712,966,715,3794,3435,1841,3820,414,1671,4497,2073,261,818,553,19462,16530,4285,29973,5791,13547,330,473,29885,392,4191,8556,707,29892,373,8164,29899,5474,454,17631,30037,4630,14746,29889,2664,14954,1173,1295,868,10212,20141,1465,27612,1444,325,1759,12036,261,611,266,17449,29892,4625,1601,509,29948,712,966,715,3794,544,30037,2608,2406,3058,267,29899,27048,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,21159,654,304,19310,675,1009,1298,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,3907,263,7333,3957,411,278,20026,491,19383,1009,1914,7271,310,11581,292,7688,2645,1009,266,6656,29889,910,6911,304,10127,263,4060,310,1104,271,3097,322,15585,537,29892,607,338,4100,363,20408,9382,278,20026,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,769,4547,778,263,10579,18806,2556,1298,1048,278,1072,2785,310,8024,14321,25785,29892,607,1439,1461,29879,515,278,1667,2643,896,526,1811,304,27769,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,297,4958,310,13138,10757,322,16667,6273,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,896,505,4586,29871,29947,4679,359,297,29871,29896,29953,7378,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,848,470,11898,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,910,10225,310,10757,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,322,24809,967,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3913,777,11828,364,9188,272,936,9224,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,304,1207,278,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":58694660544,"load_duration":238195,"prompt_eval_count":276,"prompt_eval_duration":25039496000,"eval_count":271,"eval_duration":33654388000}
