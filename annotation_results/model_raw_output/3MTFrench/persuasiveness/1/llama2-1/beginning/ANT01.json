{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T02:27:21.196118202Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. The speaker effectively uses relatable language and emotional appeals to convey their message and create a sense of empathy with the audience. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nOne instance where the reasoning could be improved is in the section where the speaker talks about \"automandicap behavior.\" While the term is interesting and relevant to the topic, it would benefit from more explanation and evidence to support its use. The speaker could provide examples of how this behavior manifests in different contexts or provide research that demonstrates its impact on learning and performance.\n\nAdditionally, some of the arguments presented could be more nuanced and take into account potential counterarguments. For example, the speaker's assertion that \"if I have a fever, I have my excuse\" could be challenged by someone who argues that external circumstances alone do not justify poor performance or lack of effort. A more rigorous analysis would consider these potential objections and address them directly.\n\nOverall, while the speaker effectively uses emotional appeals and relatable language to make their point, there are areas where the reasoning could be more well-supported and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,1794,454,5702,29892,1444,22884,29892,432,29915,1794,1236,332,316,325,359,21778,29892,432,29915,1794,1236,332,316,4439,9073,29892,432,29915,1794,1236,332,316,282,2747,29892,432,29915,1794,1236,332,270,29915,28619,443,12111,316,286,2249,14119,29889,478,681,8992,29920,20737,325,4582,29884,29871,4277,1577,2581,610,275,712,274,29915,342,20737,6974,29948,818,5646,454,9122,1465,5278,269,3498,29889,10793,385,5389,7342,29892,2257,767,802,316,1970,8837,427,577,29875,610,1236,332,316,301,29915,17192,687,29892,610,1236,332,868,4880,553,10890,29889,9353,2257,3209,316,27829,2131,29892,12852,818,1444,592,28905,29892,12852,818,1444,592,16391,1597,5566,1509,29889,3387,882,29892,966,5566,6394,712,301,29915,265,409,14954,1173,29892,10042,1597,904,1457,15008,2123,1597,904,4387,362,29892,373,966,623,1808,553,26742,2445,583,270,29915,17405,392,293,481,29889,1551,6309,712,301,29915,17405,392,293,481,20299,882,284,29892,1750,1136,2488,818,409,9484,261,1841,295,944,553,2594,374,5908,818,1487,623,7771,790,482,29892,316,301,29915,17405,392,293,481,1437,16544,1249,29892,1750,3911,3023,1240,966,5566,6394,659,1849,427,3209,270,29915,17192,687,29889,6101,432,29915,1794,10329,566,29892,432,29915,1794,1601,904,303,545,29892,1354,1444,1841,1558,275,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,375,1039,4439,20792,966,5189,743,1462,12898,358,7147,1465,966,4239,3209,1444,26099,330,4211,424,29889,1588,4582,895,29920,29899,4346,29875,301,29915,348,553,1203,10270,316,611,266,17449,634,270,29915,24209,643,301,29915,4422,4371,270,29915,16444,4600,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,1104,17219,4086,322,23023,1848,5929,1338,304,27769,1009,2643,322,1653,263,4060,310,953,2084,29891,411,278,20026,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6716,2777,988,278,24481,1033,367,16710,338,297,278,4004,988,278,25657,5969,2039,1048,376,17405,392,293,481,6030,1213,5806,278,1840,338,8031,322,8018,304,278,11261,29892,372,723,14169,515,901,8252,322,10757,304,2304,967,671,29889,450,25657,1033,3867,6455,310,920,445,6030,10419,29879,297,1422,3030,29879,470,3867,5925,393,9004,1078,967,10879,373,6509,322,4180,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,777,310,278,6273,9132,1033,367,901,4948,8362,322,2125,964,3633,7037,6795,25699,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,376,361,306,505,263,1238,369,29892,306,505,590,5566,1509,29908,1033,367,18066,287,491,4856,1058,1852,1041,393,7029,14209,7432,437,451,26922,6460,4180,470,10225,310,7225,29889,319,901,12912,20657,7418,723,2050,1438,7037,704,24247,322,3211,963,4153,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,17583,3913,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,1104,17219,4086,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,1532,29899,23765,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":65153609999,"load_duration":234039,"prompt_eval_count":319,"prompt_eval_duration":29185726000,"eval_count":286,"eval_duration":35965603000}
