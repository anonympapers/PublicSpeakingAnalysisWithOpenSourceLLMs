The speaker presents some valid points and arguments about the potential benefits of using tubes for oil exploitation in deep sea environments, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker makes a good point about the importance of understanding the scale of the problem when addressing the issue of fragile ecosystems. However, the analogy used to explain the concept of \"GCR\" is not fully clear and could be further elaborated upon to make it more convincing.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker highlights the potential benefits of using tubes for oil exploitation, they do not provide enough evidence or data to support their claims. For example, they mention that the society Valorrec is developing new technologies to exploit this reserve, but do not provide any information on the effectiveness of these technologies or the potential environmental impacts of the proposed solution.\n\nLastly, the speaker's use of hyperbole and exaggerated language (\"mantenonge suiantes en France travaillant avec la même société sur une problématique similaire\") detracts from the overall persuasiveness of the speech. While it may be intended to emphasize the importance of the issue, it comes across as overly dramatic and could undermine the speaker's credibility.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some valid points, the speech could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based arguments to be more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,853,2432,309,293,2488,29892,782,301,11078,1318,29892,301,29915,26555,29888,5340,585,447,794,1661,14344,316,3581,1765,316,1667,6056,267,1841,16349,553,282,1893,12154,1295,2078,29920,7545,29889,2664,3965,30000,793,29892,715,449,1849,818,425,3067,10936,316,5739,347,29892,432,29915,1794,875,355,29884,610,1358,316,425,19513,2630,272,3757,29892,1750,6303,9953,424,316,13942,29877,2496,553,23131,267,1671,16035,1524,5278,1841,16349,29889,341,10204,265,479,480,29875,3794,427,3444,29231,453,424,2535,425,6701,19513,1190,1597,25698,2249,15819,1027,4233,533,29889,365,29915,26555,29899,3712,311,553,23131,267,427,1223,631,1671,16035,7018,282,1893,307,492,1908,782,6299,316,425,2778,29889,365,29915,397,29948,29888,1387,10019,568,425,13855,309,4371,610,301,29915,29882,2941,9102,8146,29889,6803,7199,9030,29892,480,573,29920,29899,4346,29875,402,11341,26814,10754,29892,286,30000,29894,787,29892,14034,29920,712,7890,29871,22730,3964,423,311,29892,980,21668,623,6092,282,1893,381,818,425,6701,21206,1808,270,29915,1893,737,1750,966,263,6454,915,553,4441,29887,22702,29889,317,6223,29920,29899,433,10754,29889,9353,5278,544,1355,344,29892,373,707,427,3700,818,443,610,29877,347,270,29915,465,631,29889,4546,29875,29892,402,29990,29954,425,3669,600,5793,2535,553,19507,12628,29889,6803,363,2265,301,29915,29882,2941,9102,8146,818,443,22917,270,29915,9864,13241,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,322,6273,1048,278,7037,23633,310,773,23131,267,363,17182,16035,7018,297,6483,7205,23136,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,3732,263,1781,1298,1048,278,13500,310,8004,278,6287,310,278,1108,746,3211,292,278,2228,310,13855,488,321,3944,973,29879,29889,2398,29892,278,3483,6933,1304,304,5649,278,6964,310,376,8766,29934,29908,338,451,8072,2821,322,1033,367,4340,13771,630,2501,304,1207,372,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,12141,29879,278,7037,23633,310,773,23131,267,363,17182,16035,7018,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,278,12459,2630,272,3757,338,14338,716,5722,11763,304,16035,277,445,23986,29892,541,437,451,3867,738,2472,373,278,2779,20193,310,1438,5722,11763,470,278,7037,29380,10879,29879,310,278,7972,1650,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,322,429,9921,630,4086,4852,29885,10204,265,479,480,29875,3794,427,3444,29231,453,424,2535,425,6701,19513,1190,1597,25698,2249,15819,1027,4233,533,1159,1439,1461,29879,515,278,12463,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,5806,372,1122,367,9146,304,19310,675,278,13500,310,278,2228,29892,372,5304,4822,408,975,368,8541,2454,322,1033,563,837,457,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,29892,278,12032,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,6273,304,367,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":68930836182,"load_duration":145939,"prompt_eval_count":280,"prompt_eval_duration":25445692000,"eval_count":345,"eval_duration":43484577000}
