The speaker provides some interesting and relevant points about the importance of understanding the mechanics of blood flow and the potential consequences of a blocked vessel, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While they mention that there are 3,000 new cases of vascular disease in Europe each year, they do not provide any data or studies to back up this claim. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more examples or analogies to help explain the concept of \"inframation\" and how it relates to the rumme of the je√ªve veneux.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's argument could benefit from a clearer structure and organization. The speech seems to jump around between different topics related to blood flow and vascular disease, without a clear introduction or conclusion. This can make it difficult for the listener to follow the speaker's train of thought and understand the main point they are trying to make.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the mechanics of blood flow and the potential consequences of a blocked vessel, there is room for improvement in terms of evidence and argumentation.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,951,4723,29899,355,16825,29892,432,29915,1794,17161,29948,425,18234,316,611,15378,545,626,347,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,2331,2653,23532,316,4662,1173,610,346,712,454,4832,4079,4370,289,3222,29948,29889,435,29915,1794,3669,2608,29948,454,977,2484,427,11510,284,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,348,29884,29889,2581,1224,1794,1597,289,2663,1924,316,1437,29890,3222,261,818,301,29915,18441,29892,21181,818,9073,29889,9353,425,6316,29892,1444,26099,1006,484,427,521,381,2007,347,325,6151,1070,29889,2598,13911,333,819,29892,274,29915,342,316,1437,29890,3222,261,966,5291,29891,2993,868,14913,3165,475,29892,4875,707,325,3324,29889,751,392,1597,325,3324,707,289,3222,1318,29892,610,443,5777,453,327,316,13625,29892,373,6309,439,29915,1808,707,25063,27737,1318,29892,373,452,8164,2331,3948,30037,357,454,13625,316,18342,261,29889,1720,269,29915,5753,398,1297,29892,980,2181,1318,316,301,29915,585,2310,1004,29892,553,4662,280,1295,29892,610,10098,6701,553,2174,1912,29892,1750,452,269,29915,29891,439,986,296,2331,634,553,5189,743,818,425,1766,1173,29889,1174,4092,29892,18402,19951,29892,274,29915,342,29871,29941,29871,29900,29900,29900,26957,18554,1750,325,609,7848,1098,9030,5278,4439,328,347,29889,10016,325,3324,29892,274,29915,342,427,5291,29891,585,29892,3503,274,29915,342,427,5291,29891,585,1750,707,9364,424,29892,1750,2947,1841,351,381,18097,980,707,289,3222,29948,29889,1720,2947,343,11469,553,1374,1690,290,22702,270,29915,262,22328,362,29889,5791,904,4230,293,2131,2947,1874,261,29889,315,29915,342,818,2970,872,11101,2131,818,409,1437,24784,7209,409,274,9498,29889,8748,9411,7015,1374,1690,290,22702,29892,439,29915,265,623,1808,454,16558,1004,316,425,1444,30095,276,325,1600,1314,29892,3435,22572,29915,15669,7006,11009,375,29892,3503,26154,7006,2852,566,631,29889,1394,1354,373,452,872,277,2331,3440,29871,4277,1766,1173,29892,634,3856,373,452,8164,2331,577,21216,29889,315,29915,342,4191,1465,611,350,1789,533,29892,1354,274,29915,342,454,508,538,1750,707,20450,29948,29892,274,29915,342,2331,454,1437,29890,3222,538,15617,680,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,322,8018,3291,1048,278,13500,310,8004,278,7208,1199,310,10416,4972,322,278,7037,27721,310,263,24370,21239,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,896,3585,393,727,526,29871,29941,29892,29900,29900,29900,716,4251,310,325,6151,1070,17135,297,4092,1269,1629,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,848,470,11898,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,6455,470,15690,583,304,1371,5649,278,6964,310,376,262,22328,362,29908,322,920,372,1104,1078,304,278,16558,1004,310,278,1444,30095,345,325,1600,1314,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,14169,515,263,26135,3829,322,13013,29889,450,12032,2444,304,12500,2820,1546,1422,23820,4475,304,10416,4972,322,325,6151,1070,17135,29892,1728,263,2821,18707,470,15997,29889,910,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,7945,310,2714,322,2274,278,1667,1298,896,526,1811,304,1207,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,7208,1199,310,10416,4972,322,278,7037,27721,310,263,24370,21239,29892,727,338,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,10757,322,2980,362,29889],"total_duration":74811806840,"load_duration":245282,"prompt_eval_count":422,"prompt_eval_duration":38814580000,"eval_count":282,"eval_duration":35996286000}
