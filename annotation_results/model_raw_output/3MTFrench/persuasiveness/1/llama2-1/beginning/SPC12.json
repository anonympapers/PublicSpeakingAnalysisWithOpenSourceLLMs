{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T19:41:26.647346924Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech and the rigor of the reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker does an excellent job of presenting their message in a clear and concise manner. They use simple language and provide concrete examples to illustrate their points, making it easier for the audience to understand and relate to their argument. However, there are some areas where the speech could be more persuasive, such as providing more specific examples or statistics to support their claims.\n2. Rigor of reasoning: The speaker presents a well-structured argument with clear logic and coherent reasoning. They provide a clear definition of \"medicine personnalis√©e\" and explain how they plan to achieve it through the analysis of large amounts of medical data. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous, such as providing more detailed explanations of their methods or addressing potential counterarguments.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-structured and easy to follow, there are some areas where it could be more persuasive and rigorous in terms of reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,11797,5697,1169,3435,270,29915,1175,29915,17073,267,29889,2661,29899,346,712,7890,282,6223,29920,26610,425,1667,1354,7890,8992,29920,20737,27883,443,25974,262,1577,478,681,452,4078,29920,8164,29899,5474,2331,29892,3503,818,2257,3256,29899,27048,29892,11797,4625,19694,443,13659,10283,936,1190,7890,29889,8748,1601,18848,1136,2488,818,1841,5231,29539,7015,19313,1671,13304,782,6628,1314,454,3105,332,1020,17334,4555,7890,7890,1841,18809,424,29889,315,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,25974,457,15001,5711,1318,29889,1720,6025,344,25915,29892,1601,1203,361,316,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,17789,582,533,26814,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,461,1444,286,29915,29891,544,1975,1577,9353,301,29915,29882,30069,29886,2410,6722,1444,6427,8284,29892,8556,1029,787,544,29145,316,325,19680,6063,270,29915,19678,10283,28148,10961,29948,4555,544,29145,316,29871,29896,29900,14746,316,13659,29879,10283,293,2993,29892,9953,743,2535,19601,1465,454,2432,9874,868,4802,848,29889,6803,16455,643,7015,21880,29892,1444,966,1933,895,427,316,13830,5216,7545,29892,966,21880,2281,332,2406,634,966,21880,1661,2281,332,2406,29889,6803,966,21880,2281,332,2406,29892,2257,3435,553,19313,1027,2701,29892,13547,712,454,2245,868,10283,936,286,29915,331,558,275,2123,966,1801,1691,1473,7147,18475,296,993,610,454,16500,29889,12390,19313,3435,2258,21873,818,16455,643,1559,20554,3435,10961,2406,1465,427,1591,585,29889,853,337,3703,1173,1671,966,21880,1661,2281,332,2406,409,3435,966,13659,29879,10283,293,2993,29889,8748,274,29915,342,301,29915,627,29872,2123,2257,752,492,17851,29889,12660,16627,980,343,263,10741,4072,316,13659,29879,553,1235,5888,29892,553,4313,392,375,316,521,6349,1295,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,322,278,12912,272,310,278,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,385,15129,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2643,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29889,2688,671,2560,4086,322,3867,18387,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,3907,372,6775,363,278,20026,304,2274,322,29279,304,1009,2980,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,29892,1316,408,13138,901,2702,6455,470,13964,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,411,2821,5900,322,16165,261,296,24481,29889,2688,3867,263,2821,5023,310,376,2168,293,457,15001,5711,1318,29908,322,5649,920,896,3814,304,6176,372,1549,278,7418,310,2919,26999,310,16083,848,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29892,1316,408,13138,901,13173,7309,800,310,1009,3519,470,3211,292,7037,6795,25699,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,1532,29899,4984,2955,322,4780,304,1101,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,372,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,297,4958,310,24481,29889],"total_duration":62949607944,"load_duration":149994,"prompt_eval_count":341,"prompt_eval_duration":30710373000,"eval_count":256,"eval_duration":32238508000}
