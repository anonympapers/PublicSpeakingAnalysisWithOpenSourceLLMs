{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T17:07:36.189276161Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. The speaker presents some interesting and thought-provoking points about the relationship between gender and crime in medieval France, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more historical context and evidence to support their claims. While they mention some specific examples of women being punished for adultery or fornication, they do not provide a broader framework for understanding the social and cultural factors that contributed to these punishments. Additionally, the speaker does not engage with any counter-arguments or alternative perspectives on the topic, which would have made their argument more persuasive.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker raises some interesting points about the intersectionality of gender and crime, they do not fully explore these ideas or consider how they might be applied to contemporary issues. For example, the speaker could have discussed how the same societal attitudes that led to the punishment of women for adultery in medieval France might still be influencing the way we think about and treat women today.\n\nOverall, while the speaker makes some compelling points about the relationship between gender and crime in medieval France, there are areas where the argument could be strengthened through more thorough historical research and engagement with alternative perspectives.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,610,2257,18308,316,868,19397,5898,966,26809,553,5445,267,29889,478,681,301,29915,562,13082,5582,29920,5278,8825,373,263,301,29915,262,578,13775,29973,838,1004,332,16794,944,29140,267,29889,9353,5278,8825,29892,301,29915,26029,2131,5646,875,5289,25810,263,431,4926,610,2257,1750,409,21714,5898,966,3623,407,553,5445,267,29889,8748,18729,13417,277,966,286,30037,4467,818,553,1970,583,29889,8748,6079,2537,2853,1249,7890,439,29915,309,343,263,12471,29871,29953,29900,29900,6063,1465,454,1528,20030,316,3444,29889,7747,1750,409,21714,5898,966,3623,407,553,5445,267,29892,16703,294,29892,553,432,29915,294,5695,21394,29889,1174,22259,2131,29892,432,29915,1794,28643,13659,2637,454,14913,26883,262,634,454,17268,818,425,1436,868,4546,11771,29871,30212,479,29889,8748,1444,325,1759,7890,1601,509,261,439,29915,4999,3435,7015,13659,29879,29889,28720,17488,29892,454,3209,868,14913,26883,262,29892,29140,868,17268,29889,1459,17488,29892,425,15096,16157,1908,2123,363,1240,339,17417,1750,1671,8356,3033,355,2872,553,21038,980,707,330,1893,603,8689,2298,1354,818,1436,2131,29889,26079,9397,17488,29892,443,7006,2298,4280,29872,29889,405,681,992,1654,443,8727,276,427,29871,29896,29947,29929,29946,29889,315,3100,712,2453,329,343,282,26283,1597,15096,15182,1318,1750,953,1129,347,10741,3348,568,1295,29889,1394,29892,427,8694,29892,301,29915,355,434,274,29915,342,3348,568,332,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,322,2714,29899,16123,17223,3291,1048,278,9443,1546,23346,322,17268,297,27690,3444,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,15839,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,896,3585,777,2702,6455,310,5866,1641,6035,3276,363,594,352,22005,470,363,7823,362,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,2545,1664,6890,363,8004,278,5264,322,16375,13879,393,26869,304,1438,6035,728,1860,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,947,451,3033,482,411,738,6795,29899,25699,470,8671,3736,1103,3145,373,278,11261,29892,607,723,505,1754,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,8031,3291,1048,278,17686,2877,310,23346,322,17268,29892,896,437,451,8072,26987,1438,7014,470,2050,920,896,1795,367,7436,304,24952,5626,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,15648,920,278,1021,5374,26310,1098,20816,393,5331,304,278,6035,18310,310,5866,363,594,352,22005,297,27690,3444,1795,1603,367,13787,3277,278,982,591,1348,1048,322,7539,5866,9826,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3732,777,752,7807,3291,1048,278,9443,1546,23346,322,17268,297,27690,3444,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,1549,901,17826,15839,5925,322,3033,5049,411,8671,3736,1103,3145,29889],"total_duration":61119681395,"load_duration":286018,"prompt_eval_count":282,"prompt_eval_duration":23527432000,"eval_count":300,"eval_duration":37591387000}
