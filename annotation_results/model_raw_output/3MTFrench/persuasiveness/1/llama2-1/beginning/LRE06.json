{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T13:56:36.352016703Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does a good job of presenting their main idea and providing some supporting evidence, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts off strong by announcing their thesis topic and providing a clear and concise explanation of what they will be studying. However, as the speech progresses, the reasoning becomes less rigorous and more anecdotal. For example, the speaker's justification for why most waste is \"en fous-hies\" (i.e., in French slang for \"in the trash\") could have been supported with more concrete evidence or data.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of meta-n√©sation (a made-up term that seems to be a play on words between \"metabolism\" and \"nonsense\") is not clearly defined or explained, which makes it difficult to understand the speaker's main point. The speaker could have provided more context or explanation for this term to make their argument more convincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker has a clear enthusiasm for their topic and presents some interesting ideas, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and better supported by evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,27412,29892,611,1667,29892,432,29915,1794,1597,6815,15217,818,7890,2889,265,2265,29889,2581,325,1759,9073,1597,266,17449,1190,454,1020,17334,553,1437,305,1691,29889,1763,29875,18916,29892,325,336,2073,29892,5291,19723,6023,261,782,1437,305,1691,634,274,29915,342,443,4323,2852,1151,1671,29871,4277,29889,11948,4875,707,29892,707,29899,346,712,1444,19760,734,12468,7367,712,5291,408,425,7814,4894,296,18097,2331,7209,19398,1597,282,1132,1808,29973,2581,325,1759,7890,1518,492,7808,6722,707,611,1667,29889,26219,269,30095,29878,29892,1444,454,1539,371,425,1667,818,425,282,10870,29892,274,29915,342,1480,1387,29889,8748,23872,29892,274,29915,342,925,882,1671,18729,712,1444,3669,2350,568,29231,5495,1190,5278,266,2249,15819,29889,5701,6316,1314,7890,29892,712,425,4655,2131,270,29915,29948,386,17192,1691,29892,712,8556,1391,14125,29892,3435,427,285,681,29899,29882,583,29889,838,943,29892,1750,1671,8356,7848,16497,11728,904,1089,29887,1893,8105,882,610,8774,941,29899,29876,743,362,29889,438,1481,29892,3503,4875,707,29899,346,439,29915,342,439,7768,425,8774,941,29899,29876,743,362,29973,8748,6079,29892,5646,1027,2037,29892,274,29915,342,2684,882,2257,439,29915,309,409,21714,1465,24145,21423,4697,342,361,29889,405,681,767,479,787,29892,8556,4697,1064,787,29892,7847,8556,19136,1144,787,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,1667,2969,322,13138,777,20382,10757,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,1283,4549,491,7475,3277,1009,266,6656,11261,322,13138,263,2821,322,3022,895,8252,310,825,896,674,367,23382,29889,2398,29892,408,278,12032,6728,267,29892,278,24481,7415,3109,12912,20657,322,901,385,687,6333,284,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,925,2450,363,2020,1556,19863,338,376,264,285,681,29899,29882,583,29908,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,297,5176,2243,574,363,376,262,278,534,1161,1159,1033,505,1063,6969,411,901,18387,10757,470,848,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,12700,29899,29876,743,362,313,29874,1754,29899,786,1840,393,2444,304,367,263,1708,373,3838,1546,376,2527,19388,1608,29908,322,376,29876,787,1947,1159,338,451,9436,3342,470,10824,29892,607,3732,372,5189,304,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,1667,1298,29889,450,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,470,8252,363,445,1840,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,756,263,2821,23644,3173,29885,363,1009,11261,322,22981,777,8031,7014,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,2253,6969,491,10757,29889],"total_duration":61978656376,"load_duration":155153,"prompt_eval_count":268,"prompt_eval_duration":25539777000,"eval_count":283,"eval_duration":36438328000}
