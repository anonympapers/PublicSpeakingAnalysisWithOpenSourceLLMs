{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T05:19:15.355062483Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker does a good job of engaging the audience with their opening lines, which create a sense of mystery and intrigue. However, as the speech progresses, the speaker's delivery becomes more monotonous and lacking in enthusiasm, which can make the message less compelling.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker makes some reasonable arguments about the importance of finding evidence at a crime scene, particularly fingerprints. However, their logic is not always rigorous, as they make some generalizations without providing sufficient evidence to support them. For example, the speaker assumes that the woman who applied the fingerprint powder must have been involved in the crime without providing any concrete evidence to back up this claim.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in their initial engagement of the audience and their enthusiasm for the topic, they could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and a more persuasive delivery to make their message more compelling.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,853,17268,263,4370,419,347,29889,6298,1249,2257,712,302,29915,342,454,286,866,332,1465,454,4497,265,2535,454,18480,316,301,29915,388,300,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,439,29915,348,20536,2730,11771,316,966,4048,6390,634,2257,29627,8556,599,787,286,759,301,29915,264,339,9061,29889,315,29915,342,17756,29892,1444,7890,16193,316,715,549,261,2535,19601,1465,454,9122,21028,262,424,316,425,2181,8332,5458,29889,6803,13222,261,24145,22085,9061,29892,980,452,21668,5646,270,29915,24430,534,8885,553,758,29884,1960,29892,3503,2331,270,29915,348,14931,29899,29880,29915,29948,13295,29889,7747,1750,8556,938,29948,23458,2257,29627,29892,2257,3435,966,953,1457,524,267,13615,2122,29889,1720,343,263,1487,760,26269,316,8556,29892,7962,634,26154,27597,29889,11948,20737,29892,818,15093,14426,7175,3476,29892,1444,26099,269,30095,29878,712,7890,8992,29920,9411,427,17949,966,410,790,275,9638,361,3783,316,1597,10375,818,409,9073,10440,553,2902,1372,29889,5027,29894,3610,1318,553,953,1457,524,267,29892,7209,5646,818,4195,2225,802,289,7054,29889,438,1481,29889,11948,10440,7890,7890,260,993,29892,10754,29920,610,26814,20536,26877,654,29892,623,5606,27381,1190,966,1095,307,1169,2123,20423,409,534,8885,29889,461,599,787,29899,29876,681,12866,9580,29948,672,1671,534,8885,14984,966,953,1457,524,267,270,29915,1540,20244,316,17268,29892,5695,19154,868,712,425,269,3498,2123,8556,8556,24889,787,2257,29627,29889,8748,425,8861,12784,1750,7890,325,993,260,6381,568,29892,274,29915,342,425,15096,409,282,2663,712,301,29915,265,623,9854,818,301,29915,29874,680,270,29915,348,282,1239,585,29889,23422,818,282,1239,585,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,3033,6751,278,20026,411,1009,8718,3454,29892,607,1653,263,4060,310,29236,322,11158,12137,29889,2398,29892,408,278,12032,6728,267,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,7415,901,21196,265,681,322,10225,292,297,23644,3173,29885,29892,607,508,1207,278,2643,3109,752,7807,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,3732,777,15590,6273,1048,278,13500,310,9138,10757,472,263,17268,9088,29892,10734,19917,2158,29879,29889,2398,29892,1009,5900,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,408,896,1207,777,2498,17063,1728,13138,8002,10757,304,2304,963,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,15894,393,278,6114,1058,7436,278,19917,2158,4764,672,1818,505,1063,9701,297,278,17268,1728,13138,738,18387,10757,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,1009,2847,3033,5049,310,278,20026,322,1009,23644,3173,29885,363,278,11261,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,263,901,20408,294,573,28289,304,1207,1009,2643,901,752,7807,29889],"total_duration":61223028461,"load_duration":153936,"prompt_eval_count":332,"prompt_eval_duration":30429159000,"eval_count":247,"eval_duration":30793281000}
