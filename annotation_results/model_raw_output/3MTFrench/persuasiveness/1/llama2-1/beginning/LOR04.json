{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T17:45:46.486654909Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and uses rhetorical questions to engage the audience, but there are also some red flags that detract from their credibility.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's use of language is often vague and misleading. For example, they refer to \"produits\" and \"fitos sanitaire\" without providing any clear definitions or context, which can make it difficult for the audience to understand what they are talking about. Additionally, the speaker's claim that their products are \"super efficace\" and have \"maximum rendements\" is not supported by any concrete evidence or data, which undermines their credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the speaker's use of emotional appeals and loaded language can be seen as manipulative. For example, they use words like \"sexys,\" \"gros depuis,\" and \"mis√®res\" to create an emotional response in the audience, but these phrases do not contribute to a logical or persuasive argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does present some convincing arguments, their use of language and rhetorical strategies is often shallow and manipulative, which detracts from their credibility and persuasiveness.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,29899,309,29892,373,427,263,26379,8997,8997,316,29871,29953,29900,6063,966,282,15931,2247,22700,743,1465,454,9122,875,631,29892,1671,301,29915,29882,352,271,1908,29892,301,29915,1466,634,301,29915,14531,29889,4546,29875,8532,19601,1465,1601,2432,9874,270,29915,4422,4637,10812,358,454,20689,282,15931,2247,2123,634,274,29915,342,1597,22577,378,16666,302,2445,1230,29889,838,943,373,610,25931,28185,9373,316,1391,1169,29892,6216,359,9753,9407,2123,6216,359,1374,22824,346,329,3783,29889,26219,2123,29875,29892,2257,712,432,29915,1794,12242,562,29948,409,3594,29892,1354,1444,7890,766,712,1444,325,1759,274,351,324,261,325,359,5697,3246,11343,1041,29892,712,1444,325,1759,966,289,1883,643,1465,454,4771,316,425,20491,634,6267,10019,1524,14984,966,3984,5908,712,452,301,29915,6727,5793,818,11449,1671,8532,9073,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,1354,1444,7890,766,1759,29892,13386,29887,3543,29892,13386,521,273,29892,18916,29892,454,1020,2131,782,12088,4236,29892,454,4236,29892,274,29915,342,2428,6366,815,29892,20554,3435,14984,13162,23855,882,4224,2487,743,29889,8748,1671,29873,424,29892,274,29915,342,6079,443,14857,26742,2445,347,1462,5632,29948,966,1136,3011,14075,1661,29899,16063,2708,1671,5256,7608,966,19643,1860,316,7814,4185,1973,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,966,6062,29948,21337,22700,2406,3435,22458,5475,634,868,521,14623,2131,325,609,19397,269,29915,264,280,369,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,29892,541,727,526,884,777,2654,13449,393,1439,1461,515,1009,6625,4127,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,338,4049,25160,322,3984,25369,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,2737,304,376,5498,1169,29908,322,376,9202,359,9753,9407,29908,1728,13138,738,2821,15848,470,3030,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,2274,825,896,526,9963,1048,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,1009,9316,526,376,9136,6366,815,29908,322,505,376,27525,398,19643,1860,29908,338,451,6969,491,738,18387,10757,470,848,29892,607,563,837,1475,1009,6625,4127,29889,13,13,29943,332,721,5514,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,7500,4086,508,367,3595,408,11525,28524,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,671,3838,763,376,14167,952,1699,376,29887,1883,8997,1699,322,376,26737,5908,29908,304,1653,385,23023,1848,2933,297,278,20026,29892,541,1438,12216,2129,437,451,29126,304,263,16667,470,20408,294,573,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,1009,671,310,4086,322,364,9188,272,936,16650,583,338,4049,4091,340,322,11525,28524,29892,607,1439,1461,29879,515,1009,6625,4127,322,20408,294,20193,29889],"total_duration":59592566819,"load_duration":177096,"prompt_eval_count":290,"prompt_eval_duration":24415298000,"eval_count":285,"eval_duration":35176651000}
