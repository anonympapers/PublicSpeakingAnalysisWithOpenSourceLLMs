{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T00:45:30.605111725Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses emotional appeals and personal anecdotes to make their argument more relatable and convincing. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based.\n\nThe speaker's use of rhetorical questions and repetition of key phrases (\"il y a des jusques à présent\", \"c'est qu'il faut manger du quinoa et boire du t-vaire\") creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes their message. However, the argument could benefit from more empirical evidence to support the claim that the Ulère alternative is effective in improving health outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of the term \"s'énesscence\" and the concept of \"Ulère\" may not be immediately familiar or persuasive to all listeners, which could limit the speech's overall persuasiveness. A more detailed explanation of these terms and their scientific basis could help to strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates some effective rhetorical strategies in their delivery, there are areas where the reasoning and evidence could be improved to make the argument more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,1437,3364,261,2257,29871,29906,29900,6063,634,316,9947,21907,12784,316,4226,29889,8748,8556,22114,11825,29892,8689,7814,11825,29892,4439,28661,22527,29892,427,1098,1690,291,7015,19406,2710,443,7006,1029,4564,2406,29892,13942,29877,4798,316,25226,4439,328,583,29889,8748,8556,9411,29892,6701,304,29875,18916,29899,6500,29892,24145,304,277,18331,29889,838,943,10019,680,29885,358,29892,373,263,9411,8829,347,316,343,343,261,427,289,7293,20877,29948,29892,19397,1791,261,28273,267,29892,19397,2145,2853,818,12278,1875,634,818,2600,1524,24145,11449,454,2298,1472,27761,1950,29889,1720,343,263,553,432,375,1912,818,16474,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,21668,286,4600,868,439,1789,29874,634,1045,533,868,260,29899,1564,533,29889,28079,316,872,6316,29889,838,943,29892,1444,26099,443,367,585,367,585,904,10965,29892,432,29915,328,29885,1691,29892,3503,28185,9373,1223,296,270,29915,264,3209,9073,1035,29880,12973,29889,3872,29883,980,21668,1597,8671,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,11062,8671,29892,4875,1671,8356,6003,381,868,6964,316,269,29915,1690,404,29883,663,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,29965,29880,1908,29889,435,29915,1794,270,30095,316,12866,425,29415,454,269,29915,1690,404,2016,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,29965,29880,1908,29892,1750,6088,439,29915,4999,4625,4370,14060,743,3133,27751,818,553,22884,29892,373,11113,868,6267,18165,634,452,20423,2298,6674,4926,29889,6340,2923,1509,1465,6267,12471,17239,553,6062,29948,21337,1750,325,609,9073,427,29835,712,425,269,25747,9948,409,3107,482,818,5646,6267,11581,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,7333,385,687,29881,4769,304,1207,1009,2980,901,1104,17219,322,17953,3277,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,21159,654,310,1820,12216,2129,4852,309,343,263,553,432,375,1912,818,16474,613,376,29883,29915,342,439,29915,309,21668,286,4600,868,439,1789,29874,634,1045,533,868,260,29899,1564,533,1159,10017,263,4060,310,5065,14703,322,19310,7093,1009,2643,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,14169,515,901,29190,936,10757,304,2304,278,5995,393,278,10103,1908,8671,338,11828,297,4857,1747,9045,714,26807,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,278,1840,376,29879,29915,1690,404,29883,663,29908,322,278,6964,310,376,29965,29880,1908,29908,1122,451,367,7389,9985,470,20408,294,573,304,599,11621,414,29892,607,1033,4046,278,12032,29915,29879,12463,20408,294,20193,29889,319,901,13173,8252,310,1438,4958,322,1009,16021,8405,1033,1371,304,9324,264,278,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,9004,1078,777,11828,364,9188,272,936,16650,583,297,1009,28289,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,322,10757,1033,367,16710,304,1207,278,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":64312172437,"load_duration":218560,"prompt_eval_count":315,"prompt_eval_duration":28494009000,"eval_count":287,"eval_duration":35817287000}
