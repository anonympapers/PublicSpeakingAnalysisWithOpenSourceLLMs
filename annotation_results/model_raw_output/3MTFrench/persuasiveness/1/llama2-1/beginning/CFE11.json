The speaker provides some valid points about the negative impact of television on children's health and well-being, but their argument is not particularly rigorous or convincing.\n\nThe speaker relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and personal experience, which may not be persuasive to all listeners. For example, the statement \"when I was a kid, we used to play outside for hours without any problems\" is not necessarily relevant to modern children who grow up in a different cultural and technological context.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's language and tone are not particularly effective in convincing the audience of their point. The use of words like \"méchants\" and \"tédé\" (which seem to be pejorative terms for television) may come across as overly simplistic and dismissive of the medium.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid concerns about the potential negative effects of television on children's health and well-being, their argument could benefit from more rigorous evidence and a more thoughtful, nuanced approach to the topic.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,16457,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,22572,29915,15669,29892,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,7890,610,1358,868,639,484,585,295,29889,2661,29899,346,439,29915,309,343,263,25763,7890,553,26943,1750,8182,993,2123,4625,7618,782,639,484,585,295,1577,1174,5646,3209,29892,19601,29892,432,29915,29891,8182,275,29889,8748,1354,1444,28078,11818,7890,610,1358,868,6079,22572,29915,15669,29892,274,29915,342,610,346,712,1444,286,29915,264,339,9061,21394,29889,383,333,545,29920,29899,23088,18097,5153,9030,16825,7907,5278,298,3409,1318,29892,29871,4277,2665,1249,7015,8774,305,20060,553,4656,743,29889,315,29915,342,443,260,29654,29892,20737,6079,6722,29871,4277,610,280,1577,751,392,980,343,263,13545,16283,29892,454,1147,8977,707,20450,29948,29889,5791,25974,262,3911,263,2889,265,16100,439,29915,309,263,966,9073,868,652,370,12973,1354,11387,316,17256,6063,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,7890,452,282,1947,29920,2331,712,27962,2257,21824,1318,818,4880,261,425,13745,29892,782,1601,432,29915,264,553,282,24990,634,782,9364,424,868,269,8887,13180,712,966,29871,29947,6063,7175,862,743,274,1943,585,29892,6303,10814,1465,872,20877,29948,29889,383,333,545,29920,29899,23088,712,29871,4277,286,29915,29874,316,4239,4213,294,634,316,2298,427,2298,1424,29948,16011,1465,24145,19513,29889,1720,286,29915,29874,454,18475,6967,634,301,29915,296,336,28123,316,27128,519,1437,336,30058,17239,1465,18165,17239,316,7814,4356,1475,29889,1720,707,13214,5544,519,270,29915,348,2852,271,316,20877,29948,7175,1484,533,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,8128,777,2854,3291,1048,278,8178,10879,310,11456,373,4344,29915,29879,9045,322,1532,29899,915,292,29892,541,1009,2980,338,451,10734,12912,20657,470,17953,3277,29889,13,13,1576,25657,337,3687,20365,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,7271,29892,607,1122,451,367,20408,294,573,304,599,11621,414,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,3229,376,8256,306,471,263,26397,29892,591,1304,304,1708,5377,363,6199,1728,738,4828,29908,338,451,12695,8018,304,5400,4344,1058,6548,701,297,263,1422,16375,322,5722,5996,3030,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4086,322,16225,526,451,10734,11828,297,17953,3277,278,20026,310,1009,1298,29889,450,671,310,3838,763,376,12031,305,1934,29908,322,376,29873,29654,29908,313,4716,2833,304,367,1236,3418,1230,4958,363,11456,29897,1122,2041,4822,408,975,368,5466,4695,322,18918,573,310,278,18350,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,21838,1048,278,7037,8178,9545,310,11456,373,4344,29915,29879,9045,322,1532,29899,915,292,29892,1009,2980,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,10757,322,263,901,2714,1319,29892,4948,8362,2948,304,278,11261,29889],"total_duration":60565345321,"load_duration":165495,"prompt_eval_count":307,"prompt_eval_duration":27563818000,"eval_count":256,"eval_duration":33000883000}
