The speaker is able to effectively communicate their message and provide examples to support their points, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of contextualizing their language and providing examples from their research on the island of Homoria. They use clear and concise language to explain their concepts, such as \"longage t'écontextualisée\" and \"langage des contextualisés.\" However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker does not provide a clear definition of what they mean by \"longage t'écontextualisée,\" which makes it difficult to fully understand their argument. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claims about the effectiveness of this language in context.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates some knowledge and understanding of the topic, there are areas where they could improve the rigor of their reasoning and provide more detailed examples to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,7890,2437,568,818,6003,381,8689,868,21384,316,301,29915,29948,10936,1775,824,1808,1671,7890,5814,5893,611,266,17449,427,10466,316,301,29915,29948,29392,29889,435,29915,1794,5291,6309,425,7632,868,1472,482,260,29915,29948,4703,950,15826,427,25407,11076,29889,14255,966,21038,4625,13222,316,425,22259,2131,1190,301,29915,26917,270,29915,24259,4108,29892,3503,1465,443,378,29149,6682,2201,5176,29899,29911,1794,29899,29903,819,29892,610,346,712,1190,1601,2961,280,29892,454,7691,302,29915,342,2331,363,29883,15471,425,25407,1775,824,1808,29889,951,6361,482,553,3030,950,275,743,29892,274,29915,342,454,1472,482,439,29915,265,3667,895,13214,1671,966,7931,743,553,2258,1169,553,521,15806,1750,452,3435,2331,5814,1237,782,3256,6722,301,29915,265,610,280,29889,1222,3451,295,29892,13180,1597,5039,2131,29892,427,378,29149,29892,373,26427,818,443,12377,424,2257,712,5246,872,3949,279,1943,29889,1720,25497,29892,4875,29892,4875,29892,544,749,29892,634,4875,1539,18916,29889,315,29915,342,8164,29899,5474,29871,1654,29892,3503,980,7629,276,966,18554,634,966,5446,1691,634,373,452,26939,2331,610,346,712,966,2258,1169,3435,427,7945,316,409,29057,283,1358,29892,274,29915,342,868,1472,482,427,6434,29889,319,7175,29899,11236,2131,29892,11231,378,29149,29892,373,3911,26427,316,7931,743,19449,1750,269,29915,342,1209,29948,29889,1720,6309,818,301,29915,14531,29892,5646,818,301,29915,28661,29892,270,29915,29877,30071,425,7175,29899,29880,29915,351,5606,358,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,23120,1009,2643,322,3867,6455,304,2304,1009,3291,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,3030,950,5281,1009,4086,322,13138,6455,515,1009,5925,373,278,11359,310,15089,4108,29889,2688,671,2821,322,3022,895,4086,304,5649,1009,22001,29892,1316,408,376,5426,482,260,29915,29948,4703,950,15826,29908,322,376,3893,482,553,3030,950,275,743,1213,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,5023,310,825,896,2099,491,376,5426,482,260,29915,29948,4703,950,15826,1699,607,3732,372,5189,304,8072,2274,1009,2980,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,445,4086,297,3030,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,9004,1078,777,7134,322,8004,310,278,11261,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,278,12912,272,310,1009,24481,322,3867,901,13173,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":54672070060,"load_duration":160769,"prompt_eval_count":257,"prompt_eval_duration":24168363000,"eval_count":237,"eval_duration":30503129000}
