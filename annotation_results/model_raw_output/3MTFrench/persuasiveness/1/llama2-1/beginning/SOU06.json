{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T05:12:48.047611047Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigor in their reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker does a good job of presenting a clear and concise message about the importance of the vision system and the role of molecules in it. They use simple language and examples to explain complex concepts, which makes the message more accessible to their audience. However, there are some areas where the persuasiveness could be improved. For example, the speaker could have provided more specific examples or case studies to illustrate the impact of vision problems on people's lives.\n2. Rigor in reasoning: The speaker provides some scientific information about the molecules involved in the vision process, which shows a good understanding of the subject matter. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a claim about the prevalence of vision problems without providing any supporting data or references. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more context or background information on the topic to further support their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some knowledge and understanding of the subject matter, there are areas where they could improve their persuasiveness and rigor in reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,818,9411,29889,2581,325,1759,844,22687,610,7890,926,261,1597,22577,1139,29889,5462,7890,325,993,29920,316,425,301,29915,267,19428,1354,1444,7890,766,966,286,1862,29892,289,30057,880,261,634,1826,1577,2581,26099,3058,712,966,2298,330,473,29885,4167,270,29915,14056,7890,427,10420,10978,818,425,330,1265,29889,11948,22572,29915,15669,29892,1444,452,325,1759,2331,7890,610,1358,316,330,1265,3503,316,425,18551,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,966,289,30057,880,1089,634,966,378,4515,3435,553,3038,2540,5814,1237,1465,24145,29871,30106,309,634,8556,19172,296,316,8689,29889,2664,289,30057,880,1089,8556,19172,296,316,8689,301,29915,812,8631,634,966,378,4515,8556,19172,296,316,8689,454,8694,29889,461,707,29899,346,712,29871,4277,18165,484,1577,838,943,3022,29878,23855,882,29892,818,301,29915,524,14508,316,7015,3038,2540,29892,8556,1029,787,1597,3209,6332,316,29871,29929,6062,29948,21337,4191,282,6223,29920,29899,280,8689,427,22916,29892,1750,18165,484,26245,634,8694,29889,19551,802,425,19703,5289,18331,1465,301,29915,30106,309,29892,274,29915,342,8164,29899,5474,1601,904,10936,29892,325,609,2117,357,425,19703,5289,634,409,18750,1803,276,454,2643,1671,20563,3709,634,4327,261,5278,19703,5289,427,443,20536,2643,1750,2947,564,3511,9291,29915,585,5147,345,585,29889,1459,8474,29892,269,29915,309,343,263,1597,29342,284,347,1465,454,10814,18165,17239,316,7015,3038,2540,634,316,7015,6062,29948,21337,29892,8532,425,3209,6332,269,29915,2749,9061,29889,315,29915,342,454,3209,1671,2298,316,29871,29941,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1352,6899,29892,5697,1169,634,22114,29892,1750,3435,1098,9030,1597,4439,328,347,6094,19971,10812,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,425,1841,29873,348,568,282,647,29874,895,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,297,1009,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,263,2821,322,3022,895,2643,1048,278,13500,310,278,18551,1788,322,278,6297,310,13206,21337,297,372,29889,2688,671,2560,4086,322,6455,304,5649,4280,22001,29892,607,3732,278,2643,901,15579,304,1009,20026,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,20408,294,20193,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,470,1206,11898,304,28475,278,10879,310,18551,4828,373,2305,29915,29879,12080,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,272,297,24481,29901,450,25657,8128,777,16021,2472,1048,278,13206,21337,9701,297,278,18551,1889,29892,607,3697,263,1781,8004,310,278,4967,4383,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,1048,278,758,791,663,310,18551,4828,1728,13138,738,20382,848,470,9282,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,470,3239,2472,373,278,11261,304,4340,2304,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,7134,322,8004,310,278,4967,4383,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,1009,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,297,24481,29889],"total_duration":68505944713,"load_duration":152756,"prompt_eval_count":355,"prompt_eval_duration":32879290000,"eval_count":275,"eval_duration":35626036000}
