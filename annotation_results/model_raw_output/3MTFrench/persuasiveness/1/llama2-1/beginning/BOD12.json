{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T16:09:36.310429396Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points about the importance of having access to resources and opportunities for personal growth, but their reasoning is not always rigorous or well-supported by evidence.\n\nFor example, the speaker's argument that having a silver spoon in one's mouth means an individual will have everything they need to succeed in life is oversimplified and does not account for factors such as hard work, determination, and systemic inequality. Additionally, the speaker's analogy about the monks and their lack of access to resources is not clearly connected to the main point of the speech, which makes it difficult to understand the broader message being conveyed.\n\nOverall, while the speaker has some valid points to make, their argument could be strengthened by providing more detailed evidence and a more rigorous analysis of the issues at hand.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,30219,29874,5246,7890,2257,712,1804,28821,301,29915,17471,29892,302,29915,5474,2535,1597,2723,1908,270,29915,23641,1465,425,16380,1173,1577,6340,4486,504,276,454,5246,439,29915,348,4348,29884,29892,29871,1654,270,29915,1540,11449,364,4070,29892,263,2002,5646,2257,1750,3911,21668,1671,23532,443,21224,300,610,1465,425,6316,29889,1720,16933,7209,20480,348,270,2663,443,594,352,371,367,585,29892,4595,29892,5162,29892,3503,26154,427,5644,457,20877,29948,29889,11948,7594,707,454,619,264,2637,5278,298,6844,316,2723,453,1908,634,966,2730,1475,3345,19669,1577,8748,6079,29892,274,29915,342,5646,301,29915,574,1600,5345,968,29892,1437,18821,29948,1354,14255,966,2730,1475,8556,5695,29892,23563,4348,375,20423,302,29915,5474,2535,1597,2723,1908,270,29915,23641,1465,454,289,4582,29889,838,943,29892,3440,8164,29899,265,1437,4951,381,1597,2723,1908,270,29915,23641,1671,443,282,21167,424,316,2730,1475,8556,1577,6803,443,282,21167,424,872,277,29892,553,11825,8570,29876,743,29892,1750,3060,275,19047,443,1339,3710,9552,1671,9073,6267,6836,818,301,29915,370,374,553,7175,1256,1295,29892,3503,274,29915,342,5695,443,367,585,14419,309,29892,443,4760,1306,521,392,17564,29872,634,316,29758,262,443,2331,9201,19702,29891,424,29889,19551,802,301,29915,348,316,7015,7877,29948,1860,904,1171,339,1934,29892,610,17488,29892,425,4445,1808,302,29915,342,2331,10440,20957,29884,316,1487,17570,634,454,4439,29889,8748,9201,6919,29948,818,3999,270,1295,270,29915,14559,4445,4999,29892,966,282,21167,1934,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,2534,2130,304,7788,322,28602,1907,363,7333,14321,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,2534,263,13283,805,6150,297,697,29915,29879,13394,2794,385,5375,674,505,4129,896,817,304,9269,297,2834,338,288,874,13699,2164,322,947,451,3633,363,13879,1316,408,2898,664,29892,3683,3381,29892,322,1788,293,14585,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,3483,6933,1048,278,1601,2039,322,1009,10225,310,2130,304,7788,338,451,9436,6631,304,278,1667,1298,310,278,12032,29892,607,3732,372,5189,304,2274,278,2545,1664,2643,1641,27769,287,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,756,777,2854,3291,304,1207,29892,1009,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,13173,10757,322,263,901,12912,20657,7418,310,278,5626,472,1361,29889],"total_duration":54037425199,"load_duration":156670,"prompt_eval_count":308,"prompt_eval_duration":27598193000,"eval_count":207,"eval_duration":26438537000}
