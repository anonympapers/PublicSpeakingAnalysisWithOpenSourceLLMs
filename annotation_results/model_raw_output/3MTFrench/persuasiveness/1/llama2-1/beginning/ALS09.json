{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T03:13:07.476945Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker provides some logical reasoning and evidence to support their claims, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and convincing.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that the speaker clearly outlines the steps involved in finding a mate, using a structured process of vente. They also provide specific examples and highlight the advantages of their product (being generous with biscuits). However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous, such as when they say \"Si vous êtes bon, vous arrivez à signalavente.\" This statement is not backed up by any evidence or logical reasoning, and seems to be more of a general statement rather than a specific claim.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's tone could be more convincing and persuasive. While they use a friendly and approachable tone, there are some areas where their tone comes across as insincere or trying too hard to be funny. For example, when they say \"Merci pour ton numéro,\" it feels like they are overcompensating rather than being genuine.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some logical reasoning and evidence to support their claims, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and convincing. The tone of the speech also leaves something to be desired in terms of sounding genuine and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,853,17924,427,7019,700,428,7890,652,8356,712,1671,534,8885,425,286,473,29892,980,21668,27962,610,10741,2852,11603,29889,26383,1601,2902,1372,427,346,316,7825,21101,634,966,7456,9638,361,3783,712,432,29915,1794,8092,1190,454,29140,29892,1444,1236,1314,7890,2970,712,1671,325,9030,5278,2684,882,9541,309,29892,980,21668,10252,276,443,1889,375,316,325,2016,29889,478,681,4788,29920,1465,443,21149,5411,17124,4630,316,10984,2993,13154,4191,7814,21620,690,1671,4325,9996,261,7594,339,29915,348,316,7890,15882,443,3132,1750,7890,938,29948,23458,29889,12065,475,2331,4439,13704,29899,27048,29892,7732,29889,478,681,544,10281,19643,29920,29899,23088,29889,8396,29926,473,29892,19601,274,29915,342,10980,7081,427,26639,29948,29889,751,29915,29874,29899,29873,29899,309,29973,438,29884,1539,371,29920,427,10042,9411,966,10042,1179,316,26814,27666,29889,2581,26099,6094,10799,1509,427,289,19382,29892,17256,29889,478,681,1841,1112,311,29920,818,3999,5446,1691,29889,1720,21668,364,465,9945,454,3132,29889,11948,1661,29892,1444,282,1947,712,1444,1236,1314,427,429,29899,29879,29889,6101,7890,29871,22730,10814,29892,7890,18331,29920,818,7182,485,2016,29889,4702,455,1671,15243,954,10651,29889,10793,610,425,9460,29892,7890,316,699,13325,1597,8220,316,301,29915,29882,30069,357,1004,29889,5334,17103,29892,19643,29920,29899,23088,2257,29627,29892,29871,29896,29929,29882,782,27144,29892,3503,1671,339,7768,269,29915,264,289,9061,29920,818,633,2098,7594,339,29915,348,1465,425,325,336,347,6316,29973,6101,373,8164,1513,882,3911,427,1365,7598,443,2643,316,425,6316,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,8128,777,16667,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,9436,714,9012,278,6576,9701,297,9138,263,15358,29892,773,263,2281,2955,1889,310,325,2016,29889,2688,884,3867,2702,6455,322,12141,278,25486,310,1009,3234,313,915,292,1176,681,411,2652,4979,1169,467,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29892,1316,408,746,896,1827,376,25598,7890,29871,22730,10814,29892,7890,18331,29920,818,7182,485,2016,1213,910,3229,338,451,1250,287,701,491,738,10757,470,16667,24481,29892,322,2444,304,367,901,310,263,2498,3229,3265,1135,263,2702,5995,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,1033,367,901,17953,3277,322,20408,294,573,29889,5806,896,671,263,19780,322,2948,519,16225,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,16225,5304,4822,408,1663,3742,406,470,1811,2086,2898,304,367,2090,1460,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,896,1827,376,15836,455,1671,15243,954,10651,1699,372,23880,763,896,526,975,2388,575,1218,3265,1135,1641,29120,457,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,16667,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,17953,3277,29889,450,16225,310,278,12032,884,11308,1554,304,367,7429,297,4958,310,6047,292,29120,457,322,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":69435779929,"load_duration":152899,"prompt_eval_count":315,"prompt_eval_duration":28976242000,"eval_count":316,"eval_duration":40458900000}
