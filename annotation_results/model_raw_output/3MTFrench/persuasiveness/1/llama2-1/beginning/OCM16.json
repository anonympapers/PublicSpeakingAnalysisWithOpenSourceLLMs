{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T00:39:40.636502994Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness in crafting a convincing message. The reasoning presented is not rigorous and lacks depth, making it difficult to fully understand the speaker's point.\n\nThe speaker's use of metaphors and analogies, such as comparing the color change of fish to a night out at a bar, is creative but does not effectively convey the message. The argument that some fish change color as they age is not supported by any evidence or scientific research, making it difficult to take the speaker's claims seriously.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of language and tone is not persuasive. The use of slang terms and informal language may be seen as unprofessional and lacking in authority. The speaker also uses a condescending tone, addressing the audience as \"vous\" (you), which can come across as disrespectful.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's message is interesting and creative, it lacks depth and persuasiveness, and could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and a more professional tone.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,17043,5582,29920,9411,454,2594,276,29889,1394,23563,2298,712,270,29915,14559,29889,478,681,992,4099,29920,29892,7890,29892,2257,772,17387,1766,21867,29892,980,343,263,1597,17240,344,10331,749,29892,274,29915,342,14344,316,29542,336,29872,29889,838,943,29892,427,11755,1540,29892,427,707,29884,1908,29892,3503,5695,427,438,29906,29889,1105,361,439,29915,348,772,17387,1766,21867,427,438,29906,29892,5646,409,302,29915,29891,10503,347,2331,29892,1661,29889,838,943,29892,1671,6628,1314,7199,9030,2257,1750,409,21714,14255,454,2594,276,29892,14034,12866,2257,29627,29892,5646,269,29915,264,3031,569,29889,1551,263,11878,454,2594,276,29889,1551,707,8164,29899,5474,443,17887,7006,20081,29892,3503,1465,301,29915,333,1318,29892,7890,29871,22730,9411,270,29915,5753,536,2535,454,5246,712,29892,2298,454,1350,3535,29892,634,2298,23563,270,29915,14056,8556,29892,599,787,1874,261,316,3581,20519,29892,1209,1318,868,28099,29892,364,1509,29892,23563,325,609,6701,409,619,261,270,29915,314,26665,2535,443,4434,283,2267,29892,427,301,29915,3451,1114,533,29892,454,2594,1171,29892,3503,29892,634,18916,29892,274,29915,342,1671,23563,29892,553,26695,16933,11387,3144,7661,1314,29892,634,29871,4277,16933,28185,9373,2535,966,304,488,698,267,868,2594,276,29889,350,999,29892,7890,301,29915,1351,29920,7199,275,29892,1597,286,585,1564,895,29627,1318,29889,8748,6079,1436,6311,29892,1601,18848,29892,274,29915,342,4439,28661,22527,2331,316,7890,2437,1524,782,2594,276,29889,10050,29889,11948,28185,9373,29892,270,29915,6388,7608,316,900,793,29892,29627,1318,427,8556,4662,346,1671,4883,2594,690,29889,28079,4191,8556,7907,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,24481,9132,338,451,12912,20657,322,425,4684,10809,29892,3907,372,5189,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,1298,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,1539,12451,943,322,15690,583,29892,1316,408,17420,278,2927,1735,310,9427,304,263,4646,714,472,263,2594,29892,338,907,1230,541,947,451,17583,27769,278,2643,29889,450,2980,393,777,9427,1735,2927,408,896,5046,338,451,6969,491,738,10757,470,16021,5925,29892,3907,372,5189,304,2125,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,25798,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,322,16225,338,451,20408,294,573,29889,450,671,310,2243,574,4958,322,1871,284,4086,1122,367,3595,408,443,23221,15750,322,10225,292,297,14329,29889,450,25657,884,3913,263,2148,9977,2548,16225,29892,3211,292,278,20026,408,376,23088,29908,313,6293,511,607,508,2041,4822,408,766,690,1103,1319,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,8031,322,907,1230,29892,372,425,4684,10809,322,20408,294,20193,29892,322,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,263,901,10257,16225,29889],"total_duration":61840314246,"load_duration":149124,"prompt_eval_count":328,"prompt_eval_duration":29745078000,"eval_count":250,"eval_duration":32094685000}
