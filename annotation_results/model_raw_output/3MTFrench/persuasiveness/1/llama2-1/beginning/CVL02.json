The speaker effectively uses emotional appeals and vivid imagery to convey their message, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by establishing a sense of urgency and shared humanity by mentioning the millions of deaths caused by the war and invoking the listener's personal experience. They then introduce the common enemy, the \"vert par Hasite,\" which is effectively eerie and menacing. The speaker also uses repetition to emphasize their point, repeating the phrase \"Ch√© Lombe\" to drive home the idea that everyone is potentially infected.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker doesn't provide any concrete evidence or logical arguments to support their claim that the \"vert par Hasite\" are responsible for the war and the infestation of humans. They also don't offer any solutions or strategies for dealing with the problem, leaving the listener feeling somewhat helpless and uninformed.\n\nOverall, while the speaker uses effective emotional appeals and imagery to convey their message, there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,28266,425,26245,270,29915,1893,355,29892,980,19947,1597,12573,409,9084,1750,263,20737,5246,553,14746,316,5758,29879,29889,435,29915,1794,19601,29899,18202,639,700,23563,752,4211,787,634,7209,270,2663,712,7890,5695,29892,1444,282,1947,13214,3479,29026,7446,10376,1750,325,4244,993,1465,425,285,10877,818,21384,316,14255,4883,11825,29892,18097,432,29915,28899,275,2298,17222,634,1750,302,29915,29874,4439,28661,22527,2331,10503,4582,29884,29889,9353,5278,12573,29892,8556,1029,787,443,18926,3817,29892,8556,29892,966,3165,2708,29892,3503,8648,966,3778,2993,1750,577,993,27386,690,2123,1766,1144,2535,966,17564,267,29892,966,288,895,2993,634,6701,966,17751,1893,2993,29889,10793,427,15344,275,3817,29892,274,29915,342,454,4837,610,11699,568,29889,2664,4837,610,11699,568,3435,760,449,634,3435,316,12563,260,8284,29889,18410,2708,3435,9200,21785,3783,634,9364,296,1465,454,899,634,18729,3435,9577,6079,1671,301,29915,21813,17239,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,270,29915,14559,3435,9577,8774,305,1934,634,610,11699,568,439,294,2073,14984,966,5152,17893,9364,3794,1190,5278,3814,12973,29889,678,29948,365,290,915,29892,1597,26744,1190,4239,707,3041,342,1318,2123,263,4370,3041,342,1318,29889,3872,29883,29892,1072,19755,29920,26814,29758,262,29892,26814,26003,29892,1072,19755,29920,26814,29758,262,29892,26814,29262,29889,6101,274,29915,342,2331,7890,29892,274,29915,342,26814,29758,262,1750,707,3041,342,1318,29889,838,943,29892,1444,1236,1314,2331,286,29915,542,4979,546,316,9411,966,610,11699,568,1750,1863,296,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,325,3640,6382,708,304,27769,1009,2643,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,10127,292,263,4060,310,5065,14703,322,7258,5199,537,491,3585,292,278,14746,310,4892,29879,8581,491,278,1370,322,2437,17223,278,13254,29915,29879,7333,7271,29889,2688,769,14944,278,3619,11103,29892,278,376,1765,610,11699,568,1699,607,338,17583,6380,347,322,1757,9390,29889,450,25657,884,3913,21159,654,304,19310,675,1009,1298,29892,28769,278,16549,376,1451,29948,365,290,915,29908,304,7899,3271,278,2969,393,14332,338,19998,3041,26458,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1838,29915,29873,3867,738,18387,10757,470,16667,6273,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,376,1765,610,11699,568,29908,526,14040,363,278,1370,322,278,3041,342,362,310,25618,29889,2688,884,1016,29915,29873,5957,738,6851,470,16650,583,363,16743,411,278,1108,29892,10124,278,13254,11223,10579,1081,572,404,322,443,262,15628,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3913,11828,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,6382,708,304,27769,1009,2643,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":65329077256,"load_duration":225599,"prompt_eval_count":308,"prompt_eval_duration":28293204000,"eval_count":288,"eval_duration":37035112000}
