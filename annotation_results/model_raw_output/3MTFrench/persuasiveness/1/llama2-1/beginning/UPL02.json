{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T18:00:21.280206271Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and storytelling to engage the audience and make their message more relatable. However, the reasoning presented is not particularly rigorous or well-supported by evidence, which detracts from the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nThe speaker's use of anecdotes and personal experiences is a effective way to connect with the audience and make the message more relatable. The story about the five-year-old child asking questions about existence and the speaker's discovery of philosophical practice with children is particularly well-crafted in this regard.\n\nHowever, the speaker's arguments are not particularly well-structured or supported by evidence. For example, the claim that children are not just \"little robots\" but rather \"veritable subjects who can think for themselves\" is a noble sentiment, but it is not backed up by any concrete examples or empirical evidence. Similarly, the assertion that the convention international des droits de l'enfant of 1990 considers children as \"veritable subjects of right\" is not particularly well-supported by factual information.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's use of rhetorical questions and storytelling is effective in engaging the audience, the lack of rigorous reasoning and evidence undermines the persuasiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,323,532,29892,432,29915,28899,275,6722,10042,316,1539,2484,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,425,1139,712,767,7081,29892,432,29915,29874,603,611,926,261,818,17256,6063,29889,838,943,1120,424,7890,2970,712,1444,269,879,275,2331,9201,439,7768,25497,276,29889,382,29883,2663,29892,432,29915,29874,603,5291,1147,3417,17256,427,5291,724,294,2298,6815,270,29915,5753,536,1577,26219,269,30095,29878,29892,4875,6303,6808,457,611,1841,1713,29889,2581,301,29915,1794,7199,575,29889,10050,3503,274,29915,342,325,17016,29892,274,29915,342,285,11214,271,29889,28079,12320,29892,427,4951,29892,1750,8556,18593,553,5155,1863,296,709,29892,634,8556,1750,1047,4467,18916,818,19548,2853,29892,1444,26099,269,30095,29878,439,29915,309,269,29915,342,20737,6974,29948,29889,12603,1208,1004,818,872,1667,11158,12137,29889,8748,274,29915,342,4191,29871,4277,712,1444,4224,8885,276,425,544,15819,316,425,11847,347,2535,966,21038,29889,405,29915,342,5898,301,29915,29949,8452,868,11847,29892,341,2353,29899,29903,283,3466,1171,29892,1465,966,8595,29871,29955,29900,29889,10016,544,15819,29892,274,29915,342,16797,1318,316,760,449,1465,454,9122,29889,8748,1444,592,26099,6309,29892,11847,347,2535,966,21038,29889,315,29915,342,966,16133,1064,743,29892,1661,2331,23422,4191,553,5697,1169,19650,412,696,371,2710,29892,3503,4191,553,27128,1849,480,27499,1750,20423,10420,261,610,23778,29899,29885,30037,4467,29889,1551,5663,6223,5278,26192,818,425,15687,20110,553,4441,1169,316,301,29915,23578,424,553,29871,29896,29929,29929,29900,29892,1750,16133,13546,301,29915,23578,424,4191,443,27128,519,29140,316,17950,29889,8748,301,29915,19304,2131,29892,427,4239,1178,2406,29892,263,30058,24697,29892,8556,452,5227,407,1759,2970,454,6761,533,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,5828,29873,7807,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,9132,338,451,10734,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29892,607,1439,1461,29879,515,278,12463,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,385,687,29881,4769,322,7333,27482,338,263,11828,982,304,4511,411,278,20026,322,1207,278,2643,901,1104,17219,29889,450,5828,1048,278,5320,29899,6360,29899,1025,2278,6721,5155,1048,10379,322,278,25657,29915,29879,20699,310,11847,936,6944,411,4344,338,10734,1532,29899,17293,287,297,445,4880,29889,13,13,17245,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,526,451,10734,1532,29899,4984,2955,470,6969,491,10757,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,5995,393,4344,526,451,925,376,29880,1992,10832,1862,29908,541,3265,376,369,8270,17800,1058,508,1348,363,6053,29908,338,263,15996,19688,29892,541,372,338,451,1250,287,701,491,738,18387,6455,470,29190,936,10757,29889,20175,29892,278,28306,393,278,15687,6121,553,4441,1169,316,301,29915,23578,424,310,29871,29896,29929,29929,29900,1136,11376,4344,408,376,369,8270,17800,310,1492,29908,338,451,10734,1532,29899,23765,491,2114,950,2472,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,5828,29873,7807,338,11828,297,3033,6751,278,20026,29892,278,10225,310,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,563,837,1475,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":68604302065,"load_duration":183754,"prompt_eval_count":347,"prompt_eval_duration":29281458000,"eval_count":318,"eval_duration":39322155000}
