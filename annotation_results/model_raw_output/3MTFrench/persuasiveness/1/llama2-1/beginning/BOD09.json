{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T16:10:43.226294931Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker is able to effectively convey their message and make a convincing argument for the need of university transformation. They provide specific examples and data to support their claims, such as the increased number of students who are not finding jobs that match their qualifications. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of focusing on the students themselves, rather than just teaching them a set of subjects.\n\nThe speaker also uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and emphasis to drive home their points. For example, they repeatedly mention the importance of \"centring\" education on the students, which helps to reinforce the idea in the listener's mind. They also use emotive language, such as \"facilitated professional drift,\" to make the issue more relatable and personal for the audience.\n\nHowever, there is one area where the speech could be improved. The speaker could provide more specific recommendations or solutions to the problem of university transformation. While they mention the importance of focusing on the students, they do not offer any concrete examples of how this could be achieved in practice. Providing more detailed suggestions for how universities can adapt to the changing needs of students would help to make their argument even more compelling.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,301,29915,4548,4894,663,29889,349,4664,802,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,611,266,17449,29892,1444,592,4771,443,7006,2257,439,29915,2719,782,5435,29899,27048,29889,2581,26099,270,29915,585,312,5411,1647,427,18768,19951,29889,11948,1444,26099,5695,5178,453,1908,8939,13247,1387,818,301,29915,26759,316,425,1528,305,1808,29889,8748,818,2257,13275,29892,1444,16623,8691,316,1601,11107,270,29915,26739,800,29889,438,14340,6972,17417,29892,29871,4277,2947,7848,980,269,29915,26739,29948,29889,315,29915,342,2331,2258,21873,818,330,29539,9411,966,16283,29889,1174,8714,29892,5178,453,1908,8939,13247,1387,29892,432,29915,562,2388,5889,966,23930,647,1934,316,301,29915,26759,1465,425,13852,316,6267,544,15819,29889,11948,270,3246,29899,4346,29875,29892,7594,707,301,29915,29882,30069,1467,316,301,29915,1947,647,882,13159,14508,22572,29915,15669,29973,29871,30219,29874,9484,12470,29892,1465,1601,4946,2131,29892,373,16133,1908,712,301,29915,264,1324,29884,707,16089,2131,301,29915,3742,814,291,6351,9139,270,29915,348,2298,4595,5419,270,29915,1893,4749,1934,29889,1174,7705,27751,29892,373,1040,403,712,24145,21423,270,29915,1947,647,882,282,8146,818,25497,276,818,443,13547,427,1324,29884,29892,2535,553,2852,4749,1934,1750,9411,966,26943,1750,316,301,29915,26759,269,29915,355,277,715,2932,29892,2123,1750,452,16391,2331,270,29915,13141,275,818,425,447,19072,316,6267,4021,2450,29889,1720,707,12866,5065,5362,1671,301,29915,26759,316,409,4327,261,29889,10793,13852,1634,852,1190,443,23930,647,882,1644,5606,1661,2298,1190,454,4048,6390,29892,3503,1190,966,2852,4749,1934,3911,29899,18202,29889,1281,7283,23855,882,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,29871,4277,1804,28821,29973,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,27769,1009,2643,322,1207,263,17953,3277,2980,363,278,817,310,16372,13852,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,322,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,278,11664,1353,310,8041,1058,526,451,9138,17643,393,1993,1009,4021,8232,29889,19814,29892,896,19310,675,278,13500,310,12789,4746,373,278,8041,6053,29892,3265,1135,925,18819,963,263,731,310,17800,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,19310,275,304,7899,3271,1009,3291,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,28424,3585,278,13500,310,376,1760,5393,29908,9793,373,278,8041,29892,607,6911,304,15561,10118,278,2969,297,278,13254,29915,29879,3458,29889,2688,884,671,23023,573,4086,29892,1316,408,376,17470,309,22731,10257,4192,2027,1699,304,1207,278,2228,901,1104,17219,322,7333,363,278,20026,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,338,697,4038,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,450,25657,1033,3867,901,2702,6907,800,470,6851,304,278,1108,310,16372,13852,29889,5806,896,3585,278,13500,310,12789,4746,373,278,8041,29892,896,437,451,5957,738,18387,6455,310,920,445,1033,367,14363,297,6944,29889,9133,4821,901,13173,10529,363,920,4946,1907,508,7744,304,278,6480,4225,310,8041,723,1371,304,1207,1009,2980,1584,901,752,7807,29889],"total_duration":66903821233,"load_duration":159268,"prompt_eval_count":339,"prompt_eval_duration":30713982000,"eval_count":283,"eval_duration":36189239000}
