{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T10:53:11.478732431Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using rhetorical questions and appealing to the audience's sense of authority and influence. They also provide specific examples and references to support their argument, which adds credibility to their claims.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For instance, the speaker makes a general statement about the inefficacy and inadaptation of the current system without providing concrete evidence or data to back it up. Additionally, the argument that local authorities should take over the responsibility for development aid is not fully developed, with the speaker simply asserting that this is what they propose without fully exploring the implications of such a change.\n\nOverall, while the speech is persuasive and effectively makes its case, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,18080,29892,17043,5582,29920,29899,23088,454,2123,301,29915,314,1908,316,26814,7096,1577,2581,7890,2437,568,5646,29892,29871,4277,14034,29920,454,2123,301,29915,314,1908,316,26814,7096,818,301,29915,19800,29879,1318,29892,766,424,782,15745,316,425,21919,29889,26383,5646,454,3390,712,1444,7890,18332,29892,274,29915,342,454,15745,29892,301,29915,25165,316,301,29915,29874,680,24305,297,29948,9639,815,634,297,1114,415,29948,269,29915,342,6624,1318,29889,2664,8478,7719,1887,267,2062,2108,296,301,29915,314,1908,316,425,24159,7890,592,2970,26477,29892,634,6079,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29945,29892,443,14954,1173,332,17153,970,263,443,20207,20827,634,269,29915,309,707,2778,29887,5128,29948,443,7877,15471,29889,3387,882,29892,1667,2167,344,14931,1190,966,15481,371,270,29915,13453,29884,663,1750,20423,1539,2484,2637,23778,29892,301,29915,16061,634,553,8478,7719,1887,267,553,301,29915,272,1912,553,6367,1080,29892,553,11984,29892,553,10402,4110,634,6701,553,11510,1336,6544,14864,2257,364,575,882,1465,301,29915,29874,680,782,24305,29889,2581,286,29915,524,29948,23458,2298,10816,3479,8478,7719,1887,267,316,22114,29899,509,283,1691,316,7691,29892,868,4595,29899,509,283,1691,316,7691,610,346,712,427,5246,29892,373,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,25554,29879,263,17953,3277,2643,491,773,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,5929,12818,304,278,20026,29915,29879,4060,310,14329,322,9949,29889,2688,884,3867,2702,6455,322,9282,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,607,12778,6625,4127,304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,3732,263,2498,3229,1048,278,297,29872,2416,4135,322,297,1114,415,362,310,278,1857,1788,1728,13138,18387,10757,470,848,304,1250,372,701,29889,19814,29892,278,2980,393,1887,21142,881,2125,975,278,23134,363,5849,16226,338,451,8072,8906,29892,411,278,25657,3763,408,643,1259,393,445,338,825,896,16193,1728,8072,3902,8253,278,2411,5795,310,1316,263,1735,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,20408,294,573,322,17583,3732,967,1206,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":50108780982,"load_duration":161761,"prompt_eval_count":251,"prompt_eval_duration":23490658000,"eval_count":212,"eval_duration":26617457000}
