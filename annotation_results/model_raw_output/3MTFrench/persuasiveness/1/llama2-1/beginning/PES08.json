{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T12:31:51.007965879Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker does a good job of painting a vivid picture of the strange phenomenon they are describing, using phrases like \"paration d'une intense se veut l'ure cosmique\" and \"rivée de guerre sanglante.\" They also use rhetorical questions to engage the audience, such as \"Mesdames et messieurs, aujourd'hui, j'ai l'honneur. Et le prévu l'aige de vous présenter...\" However, the speaker does not provide enough evidence or logical arguments to fully convince the audience of the significance of the phenomenon they are describing.\n2. Rigor of reasoning: The speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or logical arguments to support their claims. They rely mainly on anecdotal evidence and rhetorical questions, which may be persuasive but do not establish a rigorous argument. Additionally, the speaker's use of vague terms like \"beauté du spectacle\" and \"mauvais présage\" does not provide a clear basis for evaluation.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some creativity and engagement with their audience, they do not provide a rigorous or persuasive argument to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1459,2460,966,1374,1690,290,22702,23428,927,29892,1750,385,2073,454,9122,19489,4196,29892,432,29915,264,17043,275,443,1750,29452,16530,20564,966,2298,16449,5820,14075,29889,997,610,362,270,29915,1540,17818,344,409,2453,329,301,29915,545,27973,1387,29892,980,3165,309,424,707,13310,424,454,325,568,805,271,4379,29889,838,943,712,23563,623,5606,15566,425,6562,29948,868,6683,6436,29892,270,29915,14559,2637,1365,1654,316,9577,286,585,1564,275,5814,482,29892,4191,425,9050,1318,316,12573,13625,29880,1647,29892,2123,425,5758,29892,270,29915,333,283,13045,15001,482,29889,2664,419,14228,427,1301,29883,3906,29889,16457,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,22572,29915,15669,29892,432,29915,1794,301,29915,28522,29889,8748,454,544,5903,29884,301,29915,29874,2231,316,7890,5814,5893,29892,12852,7209,5278,3300,861,29892,3060,30085,29877,29899,11631,29892,432,29915,1794,11021,326,29948,454,9587,29889,11948,2637,8556,29892,373,8164,425,2174,29415,7209,5278,3300,861,2123,6701,521,473,275,1671,966,938,1355,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,10395,420,302,29915,29874,2331,2653,7848,22847,22572,29915,15669,29889,315,29915,342,1671,339,7768,1444,325,1759,260,5893,316,1791,1981,261,454,2298,25947,30000,944,1950,2257,439,29915,1808,286,29915,29874,1153,1285,29948,29889,2581,452,7175,29888,1908,7890,7175,15470,29892,10395,420,302,29915,342,2331,9577,4082,275,2535,966,8955,9230,29889,13861,29871,29896,29900,6063,316,17775,29892,24145,25947,15340,1487,316,14652,29948,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,20413,263,325,3640,7623,310,278,8515,27791,265,896,526,20766,29892,773,12216,2129,763,376,862,362,270,29915,1540,17818,344,409,2453,329,301,29915,545,27973,1387,29908,322,376,1150,1318,316,12573,13625,29880,1647,1213,2688,884,671,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,29892,1316,408,376,29924,267,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,22572,29915,15669,29892,432,29915,1794,301,29915,28522,29889,8748,454,544,5903,29884,301,29915,29874,2231,316,7890,5814,5893,17794,2398,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,3307,10757,470,16667,6273,304,8072,7602,1239,278,20026,310,278,26002,310,278,27791,265,896,526,20766,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,16667,6273,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2688,19104,14364,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,364,9188,272,936,5155,29892,607,1122,367,20408,294,573,541,437,451,10127,263,12912,20657,2980,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,25160,4958,763,376,915,18560,868,6683,6436,29908,322,376,29885,585,1564,275,5814,482,29908,947,451,3867,263,2821,8405,363,17983,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,907,28157,322,3033,5049,411,1009,20026,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,12912,20657,470,20408,294,573,2980,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":66298162289,"load_duration":159448,"prompt_eval_count":294,"prompt_eval_duration":27074141000,"eval_count":309,"eval_duration":39223362000}
