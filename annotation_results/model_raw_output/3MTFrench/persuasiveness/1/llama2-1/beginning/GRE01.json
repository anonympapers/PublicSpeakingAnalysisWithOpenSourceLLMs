{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T07:11:13.337014299Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker's message is somewhat convincing, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be improved.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that \"un grand pouvoir implique de grandes responsabilit√©s\" (a great power implies great responsibilities) is a valid point, but it could be further elaborated and supported with examples or evidence. The speaker does not provide any specific examples or arguments to back up this claim, which makes it seem somewhat generic and unconvincing.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's reasoning for why they want to become a superhero is based on their childhood fascination with comics and movies, rather than any logical or well-thought-out reason. While it is understandable that someone might be inspired by fiction, it is important for any aspiring hero to have a clear and compelling motivation for why they want to use their powers for good.\n\nFinally, the speaker's assertion that \"le concert du cerveau\" (the brain concert) is the key to becoming a superhero is somewhat vague and lacks specific details or evidence. While it is true that mental clarity and focus can be important qualities for any hero, it is not clear what specifically the speaker means by \"concert du cerveau\" or how it relates to their overall message.\n\nOverall, while there are some valid points made in the transcript, the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported in order to be truly persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,443,4595,19397,2411,9854,316,6815,316,5544,4427,7719,29889,315,29915,342,29899,309,425,1841,1713,316,611,21428,818,611,1139,1577,349,4664,1444,316,1564,275,6003,381,443,2428,22500,1883,818,15093,904,15635,29892,1444,302,29915,28899,275,443,17887,7171,15529,634,13180,301,29915,23578,749,2257,302,29915,342,2331,425,22259,2131,553,521,15806,1750,18741,296,29892,3503,28185,9373,2257,712,301,29915,265,301,29915,264,5246,2535,24145,28038,29889,4546,29875,29892,1750,263,15237,364,30037,12491,270,29915,348,1559,1212,634,454,15001,482,270,29915,381,265,2315,29892,432,29915,28899,275,21028,17856,610,454,5246,316,508,4680,443,14913,29889,478,681,634,19601,29892,634,23422,427,16035,277,424,454,19397,316,425,17043,9948,29892,2653,5582,21609,19844,1597,7594,772,790,10646,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,1794,4224,24969,270,29915,711,357,1671,2257,611,19397,29892,634,22572,29915,15669,1444,7890,22847,4883,270,29915,348,316,3999,4473,8894,29892,454,7035,1671,316,15470,2428,22500,1883,29889,435,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,427,263,794,545,427,14954,13775,2257,1750,707,1399,11936,575,519,818,5646,22500,1883,29892,818,301,29915,14764,29899,29885,568,29889,14227,1481,1750,263,6701,301,29915,293,481,562,2131,316,592,1437,509,29884,533,8288,712,1601,19397,29889,8748,274,4727,358,29892,432,29915,1794,1436,29875,610,454,534,8885,29889,951,13135,868,5147,345,585,29889,1720,409,7090,1465,966,16413,311,1295,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,10579,17953,3277,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,16710,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,376,348,4595,19397,2411,9854,316,13830,5544,4427,7719,29908,313,29874,2107,3081,10469,2107,5544,747,9770,29897,338,263,2854,1298,29892,541,372,1033,367,4340,13771,630,322,6969,411,6455,470,10757,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,6273,304,1250,701,445,5995,29892,607,3732,372,2833,10579,10035,322,443,535,3845,3277,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,363,2020,896,864,304,4953,263,2428,29882,1489,338,2729,373,1009,2278,6614,21028,3381,411,419,1199,322,2351,583,29892,3265,1135,738,16667,470,1532,29899,386,1774,29899,449,2769,29889,5806,372,338,2274,519,393,4856,1795,367,20603,491,24159,29892,372,338,4100,363,738,7051,8491,13444,304,505,263,2821,322,752,7807,17385,362,363,2020,896,864,304,671,1009,10801,363,1781,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,376,280,13135,868,5147,345,585,29908,313,1552,17294,13135,29897,338,278,1820,304,14171,263,2428,29882,1489,338,10579,25160,322,425,4684,2702,4902,470,10757,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,19119,7542,537,322,8569,508,367,4100,4021,1907,363,738,13444,29892,372,338,451,2821,825,10816,278,25657,2794,491,376,535,6327,868,5147,345,585,29908,470,920,372,1104,1078,304,1009,12463,2643,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,2854,3291,1754,297,278,1301,924,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,297,1797,304,367,19781,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":72006358979,"load_duration":226556,"prompt_eval_count":291,"prompt_eval_duration":26581826000,"eval_count":355,"eval_duration":45423854000}
