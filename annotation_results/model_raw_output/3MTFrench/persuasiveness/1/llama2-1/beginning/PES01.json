{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T12:30:44.697337822Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points and uses rhetorical questions to engage the audience, but there are also some logical fallacies and emotional appeals that detract from the overall persuasiveness of the message.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is not always rigorous, as they make assertions without providing sufficient evidence or logical arguments to support them. For example, the claim that the EU has contributed to the country's economy and improved laws is not backed up by any concrete examples or data. Similarly, the argument that the country is the \"greatest\" because it is the largest in the world is a simplistic and unpersuasive reason, as there are many other factors that contribute to a country's greatness beyond its size.\n\nFurthermore, the speaker's use of emotional appeals, such as the claim that the EU has \"corrupted\" the country's laws and values, is not a persuasive argument. It is important to base arguments on evidence and logic rather than resorting to emotional tactics.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid points, their message could be more persuasive if they were to provide more rigorous reasoning and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,1738,853,20443,425,8825,1738,405,681,9364,787,443,4092,29892,373,8556,1029,787,29892,454,1180,271,316,872,680,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,263,1034,29886,29948,818,24145,14100,818,27188,290,1750,17512,15532,24145,14100,29892,8556,599,296,966,7655,29888,1691,6299,1166,2122,29889,1459,17488,29892,425,17176,29948,270,29915,4548,1414,29892,454,29871,29941,15182,482,29892,4191,443,7916,2491,29892,454,29871,29941,1437,999,688,631,29889,951,13135,316,301,29915,15654,29892,4875,263,1034,29886,29948,818,24145,14100,818,27188,290,29892,27895,1249,782,9744,29892,626,15817,272,1249,454,24228,18934,316,409,337,417,381,818,805,2487,276,24145,14100,29889,951,1841,1341,335,424,29892,4875,263,5246,712,454,9744,29892,3503,454,10879,302,29915,342,18413,1465,443,899,4771,29889,315,29915,342,454,11062,4509,29892,4875,263,5695,29889,5462,2257,2947,7890,1190,425,14100,5695,1577,7747,454,2298,4595,9744,868,9122,1750,263,17103,2298,316,425,2730,26665,316,301,29915,1285,262,424,29889,315,29915,342,1597,7242,4584,2428,772,17387,29889,7747,301,29915,8463,4584,707,443,3817,2488,29889,315,29915,342,282,449,457,270,29915,6430,283,1924,29871,29906,29896,29889,319,7446,1564,533,7890,25497,276,818,425,1139,29892,274,29915,342,425,14100,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,322,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,29892,541,727,526,884,777,16667,285,9864,2478,322,23023,1848,5929,1338,393,1439,1461,515,278,12463,20408,294,20193,310,278,2643,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,408,896,1207,4974,1080,1728,13138,8002,10757,470,16667,6273,304,2304,963,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,5995,393,278,19007,756,26869,304,278,4234,29915,29879,26504,322,16710,14243,338,451,1250,287,701,491,738,18387,6455,470,848,29889,20175,29892,278,2980,393,278,4234,338,278,376,7979,271,342,29908,1363,372,338,278,10150,297,278,3186,338,263,5466,4695,322,443,6774,29884,294,573,2769,29892,408,727,526,1784,916,13879,393,29126,304,263,4234,29915,29879,2107,2264,8724,967,2159,29889,13,13,29943,332,721,5514,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,23023,1848,5929,1338,29892,1316,408,278,5995,393,278,19007,756,376,2616,14214,29908,278,4234,29915,29879,14243,322,1819,29892,338,451,263,20408,294,573,2980,29889,739,338,4100,304,2967,6273,373,10757,322,5900,3265,1135,25362,292,304,23023,1848,28476,1199,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,29892,1009,2643,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,565,896,892,304,3867,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":61473933299,"load_duration":168651,"prompt_eval_count":259,"prompt_eval_duration":23874057000,"eval_count":294,"eval_duration":37599319000}
