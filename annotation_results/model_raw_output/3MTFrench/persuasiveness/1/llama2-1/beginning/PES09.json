{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T12:37:58.748603622Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker's ability to connect their vacation activities to their thesis topic is creative and attention-grabbing, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the relationship between water and air turbulence, there is a lack of concrete evidence or scientific backing to support their claims. For example, they mention \"l'eau en mouvement vient capturer des bull d'air au niveau d'une zone de discontinuit√©,\" but do not provide any explanations for how this process works or what specific factors contribute to it.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's argument that the turbulence of the water is related to the \"Tourment et ses oblensci\" (i.e., the movement and vibrations of the air) is not fully developed. While they mention that the tourbins at the surface of the water are related to the bulls of air, they do not provide any explanations for how these two factors are connected.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's use of creative language and imagery is persuasive, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported. A higher score would require more concrete evidence and better explanations for the proposed relationship between water and air turbulence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,29926,473,29892,1444,26099,323,743,279,634,18729,2947,8164,29899,5474,7890,11468,9030,29892,1444,544,1975,29202,553,11757,2925,29889,11948,6701,427,11757,2925,29892,1444,6773,818,10420,261,818,611,266,17449,29889,323,10281,29892,301,29915,7342,16825,29892,274,29915,342,868,696,412,29891,29899,6500,802,29889,3219,3814,1173,1190,5898,454,13137,29892,1444,301,29915,264,29926,1662,260,6698,424,9291,29915,30001,425,715,482,29889,2581,592,28905,325,568,1465,966,16053,280,2993,1671,1597,7019,985,291,316,1190,29888,28185,9373,2301,695,1318,29889,13861,966,363,1372,29892,454,1841,535,3921,29892,1444,760,482,443,1147,276,2535,4883,29868,1314,316,19717,29889,315,29915,342,7907,7145,29875,29899,27048,29892,1601,29140,316,266,17449,286,29915,342,20957,29884,7732,10098,818,301,29915,267,19428,29889,951,6282,424,634,3999,704,29880,575,455,610,966,289,913,270,29915,1466,29892,425,286,681,344,553,11757,1041,1750,1437,24023,296,29892,553,289,913,270,29915,1466,17424,28065,743,1465,1601,1147,276,427,592,9080,29889,8526,18402,10098,29892,443,6701,1374,1690,290,8146,29892,301,29915,296,12096,286,29915,264,270,29915,1466,29889,838,943,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,1750,409,21714,1577,365,29915,14531,427,25924,325,993,4332,9945,553,289,913,270,29915,1466,782,19666,270,29915,1540,10640,316,766,20621,2131,29889,751,392,454,435,2445,262,1301,29886,1908,3999,425,7101,316,1601,1147,276,270,29915,14531,29892,18097,425,11757,344,2143,5218,966,4332,1973,553,772,6609,270,29915,1466,29892,2123,18097,966,6282,29890,1080,818,425,7101,316,301,29915,14531,29892,432,29915,1794,5273,8356,610,425,5383,8645,749,868,383,3121,29892,427,7945,316,260,29915,1351,29883,712,553,8227,793,29889,838,943,29892,782,25927,316,9122,707,7209,270,2663,1671,439,7768,438,8969,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,4511,1009,11757,362,14188,304,1009,266,6656,11261,338,907,1230,322,8570,29899,3874,1327,292,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,9443,1546,4094,322,4799,7013,8645,663,29892,727,338,263,10225,310,18387,10757,470,16021,27436,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,376,29880,29915,14531,427,25924,325,993,4332,9945,553,289,913,270,29915,1466,782,19666,270,29915,1540,10640,316,766,20621,2131,1699,541,437,451,3867,738,7309,800,363,920,445,1889,1736,470,825,2702,13879,29126,304,372,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,7013,8645,663,310,278,4094,338,4475,304,278,376,29911,473,358,634,3999,704,29880,575,455,29908,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,278,10298,322,325,4626,800,310,278,4799,29897,338,451,8072,8906,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,6282,29890,1144,472,278,7101,310,278,4094,526,4475,304,278,289,913,29879,310,4799,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,7309,800,363,920,1438,1023,13879,526,6631,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,907,1230,4086,322,6382,708,338,20408,294,573,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,319,6133,8158,723,1996,901,18387,10757,322,2253,7309,800,363,278,7972,9443,1546,4094,322,4799,7013,8645,663,29889],"total_duration":75759562536,"load_duration":234729,"prompt_eval_count":365,"prompt_eval_duration":33692165000,"eval_count":322,"eval_duration":42066603000}
