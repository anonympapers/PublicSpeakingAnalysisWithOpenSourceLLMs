{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T03:01:59.589421552Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does not provide rigorous reasoning or evidence to support their claims, and instead relies on insults and personal attacks against the prison staff. This lack of logical argumentation and evidential support undermines the credibility of the speaker's message and makes it less persuasive.\n\nIn terms of the dimension of \"Persuasiveness,\" I would score this speech as follows:\n\n* Evidence: 1/5 (The speaker provides no evidence to support their claims, relying instead on insults and personal attacks.)\n* Logical Argumentation: 2/5 (The speaker's arguments are not logically sound, with a lack of clear reasoning or evidence to support their claims.)\n* Emotional Appeal: 3/5 (The speaker attempts to appeal to emotions through the use of insults and personal attacks, but this is not an effective means of persuasion.)\n* Authenticity: 4/5 (The speaker's delivery and tone are consistent with their character and the context of the situation, adding a measure of authenticity to the speech.)\n\nOverall, while the speaker's delivery and tone may be seen as authentic, the lack of logical argumentation and evidence undermines the persuasiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,26219,9947,1465,454,22591,1559,29883,6947,280,29889,27714,26814,7019,29926,473,29892,7890,4788,29920,4325,9996,261,553,8475,1240,414,29892,2649,267,712,18299,796,2550,29891,311,29892,365,29915,16061,7293,634,341,3610,273,4125,29892,3503,274,29915,342,270,29915,348,302,29915,264,7890,29871,22730,8164,29899,5474,443,25456,29892,1559,341,3610,273,4125,302,29915,342,2331,443,2181,8332,295,4356,21735,29889,1720,269,29915,23121,270,29915,348,13135,316,425,1236,585,29889,10580,371,29892,872,8475,707,443,7006,16530,5289,29892,1559,4875,707,29476,29885,1318,1465,443,4595,6562,29948,29889,10043,454,4595,6562,29948,29892,11492,29892,1766,1617,29892,712,7890,8992,29920,316,2653,26814,12377,749,29889,10050,29892,1661,29892,1661,29889,14227,1481,29899,455,29892,818,1874,261,316,3581,20519,29892,270,29915,294,1103,707,316,13618,2535,454,8714,29889,951,620,29885,424,29892,341,3610,273,4125,707,6079,29476,29885,1318,1465,5278,8475,29892,634,302,29915,342,2331,1354,2258,21873,316,23272,381,966,286,1295,1750,452,7019,3560,868,18062,868,14913,29889,11948,5646,4191,966,9400,880,29892,29871,4277,452,286,29915,3451,30037,1173,2331,29892,553,7019,4285,29889,2581,7890,263,623,5606,29882,2470,29892,980,425,5582,439,29915,30001,316,454,7167,634,260,2016,316,409,285,974,1358,1465,553,2258,7545,1671,269,29915,17192,23239,29889,27677,24113,29892,427,6701,8714,29892,25235,1437,29890,1082,29892,341,3610,273,4125,302,29915,342,2331,6366,815,29889,1720,707,5695,4439,818,29262,818,325,17016,29892,1750,6309,29892,274,29915,342,1667,782,9122,29892,12852,443,16053,479,634,1671,29873,424,29892,260,29915,267,316,3999,2947,29899,29881,743,29889,7747,302,29915,342,439,29915,1351,29883,454,8714,29892,439,29915,309,1539,3018,782,1298,818,27128,519,3814,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,12912,20657,24481,470,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,322,2012,337,3687,373,1663,499,29879,322,7333,16661,2750,278,8475,13925,29889,910,10225,310,16667,2980,362,322,13602,616,2304,563,837,1475,278,6625,4127,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,322,3732,372,3109,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,797,4958,310,278,9927,310,376,15136,29884,294,20193,1699,306,723,8158,445,12032,408,4477,29901,13,13,29930,7298,5084,29901,29871,29896,29914,29945,313,1576,25657,8128,694,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,337,5890,2012,373,1663,499,29879,322,7333,16661,1846,13,29930,4522,936,23125,362,29901,29871,29906,29914,29945,313,1576,25657,29915,29879,6273,526,451,1480,1711,6047,29892,411,263,10225,310,2821,24481,470,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1846,13,29930,2812,327,1848,2401,29872,284,29901,29871,29941,29914,29945,313,1576,25657,14734,304,25530,304,23023,1080,1549,278,671,310,1663,499,29879,322,7333,16661,29892,541,445,338,451,385,11828,2794,310,20408,7002,1846,13,29930,13189,4173,537,29901,29871,29946,29914,29945,313,1576,25657,29915,29879,28289,322,16225,526,13747,411,1009,2931,322,278,3030,310,278,6434,29892,4417,263,5645,310,15585,537,304,278,12032,1846,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,322,16225,1122,367,3595,408,15585,29892,278,10225,310,16667,2980,362,322,10757,563,837,1475,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":70984000232,"load_duration":358943,"prompt_eval_count":355,"prompt_eval_duration":32418053000,"eval_count":304,"eval_duration":38565056000}
