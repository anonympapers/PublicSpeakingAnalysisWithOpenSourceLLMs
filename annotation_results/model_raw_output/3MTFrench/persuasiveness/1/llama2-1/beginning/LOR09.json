{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T17:43:51.556468348Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some interesting and unique ideas about using plants to absorb metals from soil in tropical regions, which could potentially be beneficial for agriculture and environmental sustainability. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. Lack of context: The speaker jumps straight into their idea without providing much background information or context on why this is a problem that needs to be addressed. It would be helpful to provide some context on the soil quality and agricultural practices in tropical regions to understand the urgency of the issue.\n2. Vagueness: Some of the claims made by the speaker are vague, such as \"des plantes extraordinaires\" and \"des m√©thodes du sol\". It would be helpful to provide more specific details on the types of plants and soil methods being referred to.\n3. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes some bold claims about the effectiveness of their idea without providing any evidence or research to support them. It would be helpful to see some data or studies that demonstrate the potential benefits of using plants to absorb metals in tropical regions.\n4. Unclear goals: The speaker's goal is not entirely clear. Are they trying to promote sustainable agriculture practices? Are they trying to raise awareness about soil quality in tropical regions? Clarifying the specific goal of the speech would help to focus the argument and make it more persuasive.\n\nOverall, while there are some interesting ideas presented in the transcript, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make the speech more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8396,578,381,29892,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,7890,2437,1524,1465,443,17775,29889,2581,364,14056,5646,925,29872,270,29915,294,29899,29891,868,5053,29899,342,29892,316,301,29915,26917,26811,275,562,316,12340,484,585,29889,2581,302,29915,28899,275,2331,427,11757,2925,29889,435,29915,28899,275,427,1518,24773,1465,425,363,11992,9201,28148,1190,7015,260,29899,309,9364,296,553,715,3794,4805,536,1099,2658,29892,1750,409,302,473,29878,19047,553,8774,386,2631,868,899,29889,997,2362,9364,296,5695,553,16895,4285,29892,1750,302,29915,609,2331,4595,12784,818,4185,2147,634,712,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,263,1241,29889,435,29915,1794,28643,966,8774,3068,1608,267,270,29915,6897,272,683,316,7015,715,3794,1671,19172,276,3479,9221,12906,371,1295,316,966,3814,357,1190,553,25999,9577,8261,267,427,11510,2993,29889,315,3100,707,20737,12036,424,427,4092,29892,427,21805,347,29892,1190,553,25999,8164,9073,29899,29873,29899,309,2123,1437,11818,643,1577,8748,425,289,473,20141,316,3444,634,270,29915,22537,347,12931,1296,29882,29892,409,3435,4067,743,2535,966,610,1912,5233,2993,316,3792,1759,347,1671,9484,261,425,8861,610,29879,1808,9201,28148,553,260,29899,309,316,7015,2428,572,3794,29889,8748,992,309,30001,3440,1444,592,26099,5663,5128,29948,2778,316,11449,25226,818,301,29915,29282,316,29871,29906,29946,6063,29889,28266,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,29871,29896,29947,29900,29900,29892,432,29915,1794,286,29915,542,4979,412,316,2023,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,322,5412,7014,1048,773,18577,304,6425,11831,1539,1338,515,22473,297,21881,12786,29892,607,1033,19998,367,7795,5611,363,18032,545,322,29380,15075,475,3097,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,3030,29901,450,25657,432,17204,7812,964,1009,2969,1728,13138,1568,3239,2472,470,3030,373,2020,445,338,263,1108,393,4225,304,367,20976,29889,739,723,367,8444,304,3867,777,3030,373,278,22473,11029,322,18032,3631,23274,297,21881,12786,304,2274,278,5065,14703,310,278,2228,29889,13,29906,29889,478,351,3837,404,29901,3834,310,278,16726,1754,491,278,25657,526,25160,29892,1316,408,376,2783,715,3794,4805,536,1099,2658,29908,322,376,2783,8774,386,2631,868,899,1642,739,723,367,8444,304,3867,901,2702,4902,373,278,4072,310,18577,322,22473,3519,1641,12992,304,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,777,14288,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,1009,2969,1728,13138,738,10757,470,5925,304,2304,963,29889,739,723,367,8444,304,1074,777,848,470,11898,393,22222,278,7037,23633,310,773,18577,304,6425,11831,1539,1338,297,21881,12786,29889,13,29946,29889,853,8551,14433,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,7306,338,451,9186,2821,29889,4683,896,1811,304,27391,15075,475,519,18032,545,23274,29973,4683,896,1811,304,12020,3773,8326,404,1048,22473,11029,297,21881,12786,29973,15183,9215,278,2702,7306,310,278,12032,723,1371,304,8569,278,2980,322,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,8031,7014,9132,297,278,1301,924,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,278,12032,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":72226394084,"load_duration":172721,"prompt_eval_count":298,"prompt_eval_duration":25310898000,"eval_count":373,"eval_duration":46914865000}
