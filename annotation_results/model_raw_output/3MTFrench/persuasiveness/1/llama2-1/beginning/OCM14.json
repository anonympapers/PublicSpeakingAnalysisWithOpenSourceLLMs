The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses examples from different cities to illustrate the widespread nature of the terrorist attacks and the need for comprehensive plans to address the issue of radicalization. They also provide a detailed analysis of the French government's national prevention plan for radicalization, highlighting its lack of clarity and specificity.\n\nHowever, there are some points where the speaker could have provided more evidence or reasoning to support their claims. For example, the speaker mentions that the concept of radicalization lacks a clear legal or scientific definition, but they do not provide any examples or case studies to illustrate this point. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more context on why the lack of clarity in the plan is a significant issue.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a convincing argument, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,9669,29892,15557,634,3681,29889,8316,275,4213,267,29892,7732,11875,2701,316,8441,29892,5227,407,2406,270,29915,332,1171,610,553,1098,296,1446,15115,9230,29892,25659,818,2257,439,29915,265,623,1808,425,24818,4371,29889,838,943,29892,3700,818,5278,1757,815,29892,966,19397,29879,970,29879,427,3444,3435,3984,427,2058,553,13900,316,15481,371,8474,425,24818,4371,29892,3503,1750,13149,6311,767,802,316,18165,20809,7719,29889,6803,339,7768,1577,315,29915,342,301,29915,348,553,21420,712,1444,1020,568,1465,611,266,17449,634,712,8556,599,787,8689,21285,29889,951,1203,361,316,5278,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,19397,2654,265,1089,18165,20809,2131,634,6366,562,2131,818,7015,13900,29889,838,943,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,309,452,2947,2331,2535,425,17837,316,24818,4371,7847,802,274,29915,342,4875,1750,707,427,4556,270,29915,24430,1577,6340,302,29915,29874,2331,316,3829,29889,405,29915,29891,11099,333,1387,29892,302,29915,29891,9638,22781,29889,1459,17488,29892,1465,454,25915,316,611,266,17449,29892,1444,592,26099,26842,404,29948,782,3814,4797,316,7175,7316,316,425,24818,4371,14649,1318,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29947,610,454,17284,29889,8748,818,7209,29899,29881,681,2062,895,29892,373,8164,343,8689,454,3184,24818,4371,3503,2331,1597,25642,10098,29892,2257,712,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,29889,20513,499,271,29892,7890,29871,22730,13220,29892,302,29915,1639,558,7342,610,1465,5278,17837,4191,29892,10814,7890,3031,569,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,17583,3913,6455,515,1422,14368,304,28475,278,281,2247,29886,949,5469,310,278,15115,391,16661,322,278,817,363,15171,6270,13900,304,3211,278,2228,310,24818,2133,29889,2688,884,3867,263,13173,7418,310,278,5176,5874,29915,29879,4797,5557,291,3814,363,24818,2133,29892,12141,292,967,10225,310,7542,537,322,2702,537,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,3291,988,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,470,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,6964,310,24818,2133,425,4684,263,2821,11706,470,16021,5023,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,6455,470,1206,11898,304,28475,445,1298,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,373,2020,278,10225,310,7542,537,297,278,3814,338,263,7282,2228,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,17953,3277,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":57316526920,"load_duration":232416,"prompt_eval_count":296,"prompt_eval_duration":27042691000,"eval_count":240,"eval_duration":30273034000}
