{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T13:46:53.852347155Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present their argument in a persuasive manner. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker starts off by using an analogy (the palace of ice) to explain their topic, which is a good way to make their message more relatable and accessible to the audience. However, they do not provide enough context or background information to fully understand the issue they are trying to address.\n2. The speaker uses technical terms and concepts (such as \"topological optimization,\" \"filtration,\" and \"cloison transparente\") without properly explaining them, which can make it difficult for non-experts to follow their argument. While some of these terms may be familiar to the audience, others may find themselves lost or confused.\n3. The speaker's delivery is somewhat disjointed and lacking in fluidity, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a tendency to repeat themselves. This can make the message feel less coherent and persuasive overall.\n4. The speaker's use of hand gestures and body language is minimal, which can make their delivery feel more monotone and less engaging.\n\nOverall, while the speaker has some good ideas and insights, they could benefit from improving their presentation skills to better convey their message and persuade their audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,4546,29875,29892,1444,16623,316,301,29915,20640,4371,2246,20015,1671,534,8885,301,29915,351,3977,882,5994,744,316,1775,5289,1465,443,977,2484,1465,454,541,316,1437,22678,29948,316,301,29915,14531,29889,422,1004,29871,4277,29892,29871,4277,263,301,29915,1466,752,492,17851,29892,3503,1444,1236,1314,7890,301,29915,4548,492,7808,29889,478,681,992,4099,29920,454,5112,1759,553,330,6048,29892,274,29915,342,5278,1098,13857,439,29915,265,24722,18484,1465,966,2258,1169,316,363,11992,29889,951,541,29892,534,8885,425,26558,1671,18729,29892,980,21668,1020,369,643,818,425,6079,29899,348,29892,4642,610,443,21285,316,17184,2285,1301,862,2016,29889,8748,16805,944,29892,4191,373,2947,10019,1524,316,409,17043,13639,634,316,409,5663,8885,2535,1597,289,2209,1190,454,4565,29892,373,3667,895,3999,1667,29879,634,427,260,271,7293,29889,3674,29892,29871,1654,980,343,263,1597,17184,2285,29892,1444,286,29915,2749,9061,29889,3674,29892,29871,1654,274,29915,342,18900,29892,1444,1236,1314,1029,25856,29889,1174,4951,29892,7890,992,4099,29920,2257,712,1444,2453,1314,2970,29889,1174,410,29899,29883,23458,29892,782,6958,553,610,11505,29892,634,373,980,425,5582,553,26695,316,437,335,1372,1190,966,13901,690,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,443,12377,424,1750,4625,24889,29948,2535,966,1667,29879,29899,19585,29892,1671,23778,29899,29885,30037,4467,409,5663,8885,818,2656,381,2535,966,1667,29879,29899,771,5707,29889,319,4889,316,260,271,7293,29892,10814,578,29892,274,29915,342,2257,439,29915,265,263,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,1009,2980,297,263,20408,294,573,8214,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,8665,1283,491,773,385,3483,6933,313,1552,24369,310,14890,29897,304,5649,1009,11261,29892,607,338,263,1781,982,304,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,322,15579,304,278,20026,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,3030,470,3239,2472,304,8072,2274,278,2228,896,526,1811,304,3211,29889,13,29906,29889,450,25657,3913,16905,4958,322,22001,313,14565,408,376,3332,5996,13883,1699,376,1777,509,362,1699,322,376,15126,2285,1301,862,2016,1159,1728,6284,24232,963,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,363,1661,29899,735,546,1372,304,1101,1009,2980,29889,5806,777,310,1438,4958,1122,367,9985,304,278,20026,29892,4045,1122,1284,6053,5714,470,9613,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,28289,338,10579,766,12090,287,322,10225,292,297,22576,537,29892,411,633,6685,1301,2187,1546,7014,322,263,260,5197,304,12312,6053,29889,910,508,1207,278,2643,4459,3109,16165,261,296,322,20408,294,573,12463,29889,13,29946,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,671,310,1361,7737,1973,322,3573,4086,338,13114,29892,607,508,1207,1009,28289,4459,901,21196,650,322,3109,3033,6751,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,756,777,1781,7014,322,1663,5861,29892,896,1033,14169,515,4857,1747,1009,24329,25078,304,2253,27769,1009,2643,322,20408,1943,1009,20026,29889],"total_duration":68328324619,"load_duration":257922,"prompt_eval_count":306,"prompt_eval_duration":28953183000,"eval_count":305,"eval_duration":39374281000}
