{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T00:49:46.518479364Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 on the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices to convey their message and present their argument.\n\nThe speaker starts by using humor to grab the audience's attention and establish a connection with them. They then use a question to engage the audience and encourage them to think about their own perceptions of international students. The speaker also uses repetition (repeating the phrase \"un Ã©tudiant international\") to emphasize their point and make it more memorable.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is rigorous, as they provide examples and evidence to support their claim that the stereotype of international students being lazy is unfair and inaccurate. They also acknowledge the complexity of the issue by mentioning the double-v process of acculturation, which highlights their understanding of the topic.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve to make their argument even more persuasive. For example, they could provide more specific examples of how international students adapt to their new environment, which would help to illustrate their point further. Additionally, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or criticisms of their position to make their argument more robust.\n\nOverall, the speaker does an excellent job in presenting their argument and persuading the audience of their perspective. The use of rhetorical devices, evidence, and a clear structure contribute to the effectiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,751,392,1444,26427,3479,18554,316,1601,875,283,6617,29892,3440,4875,409,12450,2016,443,2852,4749,424,6121,29892,432,29915,711,29873,993,15237,425,6701,1841,1713,29889,315,29915,342,443,17222,2594,283,316,332,29889,349,801,1738,1174,5246,11364,29892,443,2852,4749,424,7006,2437,11521,1465,3999,22299,29889,5462,316,380,10651,29899,29873,29899,309,7890,452,16391,29920,2331,1577,435,29915,264,872,275,21907,12784,29889,2581,16623,1601,11619,271,1465,454,25915,270,29915,1540,1302,459,10500,2637,425,3444,634,454,7400,29889,7747,1750,5246,316,19601,29892,1597,2852,566,12361,20110,29889,29871,30219,29874,286,29915,29874,3635,275,316,12036,261,712,589,9318,7015,4558,634,316,301,29915,496,1308,276,782,2393,29948,29892,373,2123,2204,347,29202,818,301,29915,29654,9639,424,316,3999,2852,4749,1934,29889,365,29915,1893,566,12361,20110,29892,29871,4277,263,10042,5646,7594,339,29915,348,1750,16374,269,29915,21412,634,269,29915,1175,5402,443,12471,17239,439,29915,309,734,1841,29880,4564,1309,29884,29889,9353,425,23520,29892,15093,263,5143,882,634,15093,28206,3435,818,7006,966,9580,2093,1190,270,29915,5753,499,2633,29889,8748,274,29915,342,925,882,454,18165,17239,316,2257,8774,3068,6386,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,1465,454,25915,316,611,266,17449,29889,1174,10684,29892,454,1889,375,270,29915,5753,499,2633,707,17899,29948,5898,425,13618,270,29915,1540,1302,459,427,3765,29899,29894,29889,751,29875,409,8556,10503,993,818,443,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,27769,1009,2643,322,2198,1009,2980,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,773,27448,304,17229,278,20026,29915,29879,8570,322,10127,263,3957,411,963,29889,2688,769,671,263,1139,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,13731,6617,963,304,1348,1048,1009,1914,639,1441,29879,310,6121,8041,29889,450,25657,884,3913,21159,654,313,276,412,1218,278,16549,376,348,2852,4749,424,6121,1159,304,19310,675,1009,1298,322,1207,372,901,26959,519,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,12912,20657,29892,408,896,3867,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,269,12358,327,668,310,6121,8041,1641,17366,338,29395,1466,322,297,562,2764,403,29889,2688,884,18145,5485,278,13644,310,278,2228,491,3585,292,278,3765,29899,29894,1889,310,1035,499,2633,29892,607,12141,29879,1009,8004,310,278,11261,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2980,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,3867,901,2702,6455,310,920,6121,8041,7744,304,1009,716,5177,29892,607,723,1371,304,28475,1009,1298,4340,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,11164,12903,310,1009,2602,304,1207,1009,2980,901,16424,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,947,385,15129,4982,297,2198,292,1009,2980,322,20408,9382,278,20026,310,1009,18520,29889,450,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,29892,10757,29892,322,263,2821,3829,29126,304,278,2779,20193,310,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":67364570791,"load_duration":147988,"prompt_eval_count":293,"prompt_eval_duration":26606361000,"eval_count":322,"eval_duration":40757501000}
