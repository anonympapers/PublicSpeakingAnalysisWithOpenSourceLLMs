{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T13:48:14.53747799Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and uses rhetorical devices to make their point, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker uses humor and anecdotes to engage the audience and make their message more relatable. For example, they use the example of a famous woman named Irma to illustrate their point about the unpredictability of birth. They also use rhetorical questions to encourage the audience to think critically about the topic.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker's argument that \"metiers-tourine\" and \"suivi-grossesse\" are more convincing than \"grafies de moni-tourine\" and \"plan de périnatalité\" is not fully developed. The speaker does not provide any evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim, which makes it seem like a personal opinion rather than a well-reasoned argument.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of hyperbole and exaggeration (e.g., \"des machines, des médecins, des sages fameux tour de vous\") can be seen as overly dramatic and may undermine the credibility of their argument. While it is true that medical technology has advanced significantly since 1946, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of such technology and the importance of traditional birth practices as well.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects this balance between persuasiveness and rigor in the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,980,343,263,19449,1750,7175,2218,296,425,286,7342,29877,2123,10440,19449,1750,7175,2218,296,425,6003,381,4191,5278,19489,30000,1030,10395,420,6600,655,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,452,544,2487,12737,264,29892,3503,1444,16623,21907,12784,316,6628,1314,29889,4731,7081,29892,1444,592,17775,1759,1465,454,8714,29889,6101,1444,7890,766,274,29915,14386,782,885,711,316,12534,538,29892,2257,21714,4439,29887,457,29892,26520,293,309,457,2123,10440,3814,316,282,1064,262,2075,2131,29892,7890,316,13325,7890,2970,3503,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,1808,8556,1153,535,371,29889,11948,373,4313,5340,29892,1444,7890,610,11818,553,22956,583,316,1601,29875,29899,29873,473,457,29892,316,480,8107,29899,29887,2124,5340,29892,29871,4277,7890,610,280,8164,29899,5474,443,7006,2298,29889,1459,2460,7890,29892,4883,270,1280,409,29627,29892,8164,29899,5474,712,3058,267,4625,20737,27282,1055,9948,29889,8748,25763,7890,29892,4473,8894,29892,6079,29892,7890,8992,29920,2304,29948,29889,390,932,6146,29920,29899,23088,1465,5278,269,3498,270,29915,562,3222,882,29892,553,14884,29892,553,25974,1144,29892,553,269,1179,27965,1314,6282,316,7890,29892,5646,707,11266,16083,11728,29892,4313,30069,12898,634,966,289,10126,743,19445,427,1735,25595,358,427,3209,316,25698,5000,29889,11948,1190,6033,1647,29899,29903,1450,1100,766,424,427,564,9318,29892,1539,2484,782,9122,634,6003,381,782,9122,302,29915,29948,13048,2331,521,2631,2258,21873,29889,405,681,1047,4467,427,29871,29896,29929,29946,29953,29889,997,5027,13094,707,443,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3913,27448,322,385,687,29881,4769,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,671,278,1342,310,263,13834,6114,4257,6600,655,304,28475,1009,1298,1048,278,443,27711,3097,310,12060,29889,2688,884,671,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,13731,6617,278,20026,304,1348,3994,1711,1048,278,11261,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,376,2527,4285,29899,29873,473,457,29908,322,376,2146,8107,29899,29887,2124,5340,29908,526,901,17953,3277,1135,376,29887,1929,583,316,1601,29875,29899,29873,473,457,29908,322,376,9018,316,282,1064,262,2075,2131,29908,338,451,8072,8906,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,445,5995,29892,607,3732,372,2833,763,263,7333,9426,3265,1135,263,1532,29899,23147,287,2980,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,11266,833,280,322,429,9921,362,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,2783,14884,29892,553,25974,1144,29892,553,269,1179,27965,1314,6282,316,7890,1159,508,367,3595,408,975,368,8541,2454,322,1122,563,837,457,278,6625,4127,310,1009,2980,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,16083,15483,756,12862,16951,1951,29871,29896,29929,29946,29953,29892,372,338,4100,304,18145,5485,278,27028,310,1316,15483,322,278,13500,310,13807,12060,23274,408,1532,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,445,17346,1546,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,297,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":80672384544,"load_duration":189805,"prompt_eval_count":310,"prompt_eval_duration":29355381000,"eval_count":395,"eval_duration":51316282000}
