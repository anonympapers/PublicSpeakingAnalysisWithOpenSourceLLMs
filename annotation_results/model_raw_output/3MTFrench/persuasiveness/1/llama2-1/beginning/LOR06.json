{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T17:44:46.881756994Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and evidence to support their case, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of establishing their credibility and expertise in the field, which helps to build trust with the jury. They also provide specific examples and data to illustrate their points, which adds weight to their argument. For example, their explanation of how the persuasion works through different channels, such as social media and advertising, is well-supported by studies and research.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For instance, the speaker's assertion that \"la persuasion oeuvre aussi pour la bonne cause\" (persuasion works for the good cause) could be challenged by asking for more evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's third stage of their argument, where they propose a solution to the problem of persuasion, could be more fully developed and nuanced.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some compelling arguments and evidence, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and comprehensive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,18080,29892,4473,8894,966,11099,743,29892,1444,592,16391,19398,7890,22572,29915,15669,1671,11482,9030,425,4556,316,611,3132,29872,29892,425,20408,7002,29889,6340,707,26142,1318,270,29915,13453,3837,2265,966,20299,4110,427,1354,29899,9894,1934,29892,1465,553,274,2049,29891,575,634,553,8324,29889,478,681,1437,5464,29883,1318,872,29845,1465,1597,1773,4279,316,11549,277,10270,7825,1512,1314,29889,2581,7199,1975,325,359,274,5270,267,29889,10050,992,347,270,29915,348,2643,29892,443,7284,270,29915,328,3640,29884,427,297,6578,1893,29889,11948,425,20408,7002,288,29872,4090,276,5695,1671,425,289,7293,4556,29889,435,29915,932,1808,818,425,2594,276,7629,1318,11387,5882,29892,1750,7890,1283,374,336,818,966,758,29884,1960,18806,13876,868,1437,29894,283,882,29892,316,611,3132,29872,782,2669,316,301,29915,21813,17239,29889,26475,19882,29892,274,29915,342,454,29140,782,13295,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,29889,461,443,274,2049,11771,8164,13417,533,553,4348,375,818,1874,261,6267,20299,882,634,7175,3476,15471,553,20299,4110,7853,1849,818,301,29915,21813,17239,1577,6803,25497,276,818,5278,1139,29892,286,29915,1131,342,29899,346,270,29915,4582,1132,267,427,7732,2852,11603,29889,28720,904,941,412,29892,432,29915,1794,7019,1464,5483,7732,11840,29892,399,29956,29686,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,10757,304,2304,1009,1206,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,10127,292,1009,6625,4127,322,17924,895,297,278,1746,29892,607,6911,304,2048,9311,411,278,432,2857,29889,2688,884,3867,2702,6455,322,848,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,607,12778,7688,304,1009,2980,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,8252,310,920,278,20408,7002,1736,1549,1422,18196,29892,1316,408,5264,5745,322,18811,5921,29892,338,1532,29899,23765,491,11898,322,5925,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,376,433,20408,7002,288,29872,4090,276,5695,1671,425,289,7293,4556,29908,313,6774,29884,7002,1736,363,278,1781,4556,29897,1033,367,18066,287,491,6721,363,901,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4654,7408,310,1009,2980,29892,988,896,16193,263,1650,304,278,1108,310,20408,7002,29892,1033,367,901,8072,8906,322,4948,8362,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,752,7807,6273,322,10757,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,15171,6270,29889],"total_duration":55312018580,"load_duration":250911,"prompt_eval_count":261,"prompt_eval_duration":21907058000,"eval_count":271,"eval_duration":33404232000}
