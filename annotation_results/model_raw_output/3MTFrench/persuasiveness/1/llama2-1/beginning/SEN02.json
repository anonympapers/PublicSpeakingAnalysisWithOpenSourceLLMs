{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T22:13:06.22557542Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker's argument is not particularly convincing as it relies heavily on an either/or scenario, where they either choose to present the best option or suppress all other competitors. This approach lacks nuance and does not take into account the complexity of the situation. Additionally, the speaker's tone comes across as dismissive and unhelpful, which can undermine their credibility.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is not rigorous enough as they fail to provide any concrete evidence or logical arguments to support their claim. The statement \"La prescription, c'est un peu la date de p√©rande-bion d'amerture\" is not a valid reason for why the prescription period should be ignored, and the speaker's reliance on generalizations and assumptions without proper evidence is a significant flaw in their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker may have a point regarding the importance of the prescription period, their approach and reasoning are not persuasive enough to convince the audience of their position.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,2257,439,29915,265,7890,26427,29892,274,29915,342,316,3060,275,381,425,15378,545,5814,9233,29889,6803,712,2257,12852,19601,29892,1444,29758,4239,3987,29889,12852,818,9073,425,15378,545,5814,9233,29892,12852,1462,5632,29948,9411,966,10890,3022,1038,1237,29889,8748,610,4771,29892,316,7015,610,5444,17334,3440,1041,634,13545,29899,6948,7848,297,6578,28141,610,425,15426,29892,980,9378,277,316,6079,439,29915,30001,14255,454,14913,634,270,29915,1131,9030,454,1437,11818,316,2225,699,1980,29889,997,2225,3395,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,425,2635,316,26535,661,311,29899,29890,291,270,29915,314,814,545,29889,26383,454,8714,29892,966,758,29884,1960,480,267,409,1437,5105,296,1354,6079,818,443,3209,7175,794,424,29892,20554,452,3435,2298,2414,29894,1849,19398,443,9434,17507,29889,3872,29883,29892,21714,29920,553,301,30000,1960,29892,1444,26099,22024,339,1924,29889,306,455,7594,339,29915,348,16391,454,14913,10042,29892,29871,4277,409,752,9854,443,7006,29892,3503,1444,286,29915,262,6578,12973,2331,9201,29889,997,10974,2181,8332,295,2947,427,20744,2635,553,3966,744,698,267,29889,6803,4048,6390,1354,454,1437,11818,316,2225,699,1980,707,1209,29948,2123,1661,29892,3503,1444,17043,275,6267,8774,386,356,29892,274,29915,342,553,1418,800,20674,3783,634,20554,767,16011,316,16784,2459,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,373,707,5646,2257,1750,5246,364,1975,29889,8748,425,15259,316,7814,359,722,347,14864,24145,7916,29872,29892,24145,19406,479,29892,2123,10440,7814,4760,8192,20196,7147,29892,1136,21871,2063,29889,8407,29899,802,29892,7814,6316,7545,2684,882,316,425,6701,26722,29889,8748,966,13930,1295,316,1418,800,3435,29202,316,10741,270,466,13116,270,29915,812,2406,29889,8748,274,29915,342,925,882,29871,4277,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,451,10734,17953,3277,408,372,337,3687,20365,373,385,2845,29914,272,10483,29892,988,896,2845,6755,304,2198,278,1900,2984,470,21301,599,916,5100,17259,29889,910,2948,425,4684,4948,749,322,947,451,2125,964,3633,278,13644,310,278,6434,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,5304,4822,408,18918,573,322,443,8477,1319,29892,607,508,563,837,457,1009,6625,4127,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,12912,20657,3307,408,896,4418,304,3867,738,18387,10757,470,16667,6273,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,450,3229,376,5661,2225,3395,29892,274,29915,342,443,7006,425,2635,316,26535,661,311,29899,29890,291,270,29915,314,814,545,29908,338,451,263,2854,2769,363,2020,278,2225,3395,3785,881,367,17262,29892,322,278,25657,29915,29879,12536,749,373,2498,17063,322,20813,1728,1571,10757,338,263,7282,285,10653,297,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1122,505,263,1298,11211,278,13500,310,278,2225,3395,3785,29892,1009,2948,322,24481,526,451,20408,294,573,3307,304,7602,1239,278,20026,310,1009,2602,29889],"total_duration":66788245169,"load_duration":264854,"prompt_eval_count":355,"prompt_eval_duration":32394486000,"eval_count":271,"eval_duration":34392946000}
