{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T05:21:38.562365172Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker is trying to convince the audience that their proposed solution to cancer treatment is effective and has fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy. However, the argumentation is not very convincing and lacks logical coherence.\n\nHere are some reasons why:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: The speaker claims that their solution will \"diminue en l'adose\" (reduce the dose) and \"augmentant de l'émodépassion\" (increase the energy level), but there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. In fact, many studies have shown that reducing the dose of chemotherapy can lead to a higher risk of cancer recurrence.\n2. Misunderstanding of cancer biology: The speaker seems to be confusing the concept of \"diffusion\" with the spread of cancer cells in the body. Cancer cells do not diffuse randomly throughout the body; rather, they follow specific pathways and mechanisms that allow them to migrate and colonize new sites.\n3. Lack of consideration of other factors: The speaker does not take into account other important factors that can affect cancer treatment, such as the patient's overall health status, their genetic profile, and the specific characteristics of their cancer diagnosis.\n4. Unclear logic: The speaker jumps between different ideas without connecting them logically. For example, they mention \"tuyau imperméiable\" (a impermeable tube) without explaining how it relates to cancer treatment.\n5. Lack of clarity and simplicity: The speaker's message is not clear and simple enough for the audience to easily understand. They use technical terms and complex sentences that may be difficult for non-experts to follow.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's intention may be good, their argumentation is not well-structured or supported by evidence, which hinders their ability to convince the audience of their proposed solution.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,712,454,10283,293,1166,11658,29948,1465,24145,14913,2947,409,1841,1595,381,760,449,634,712,454,925,29872,1597,22577,4323,2131,316,409,10283,293,1166,2947,21609,19844,301,29915,6388,2131,29889,8748,373,263,454,6701,1671,301,29915,1893,277,434,23900,261,1559,454,10283,293,1166,9418,29899,29883,661,2265,261,302,29915,279,4401,2331,818,12694,264,13241,427,534,277,790,375,424,634,868,23900,261,29889,360,29915,29877,30071,409,10283,293,1166,22847,1597,2752,553,285,6394,1473,7147,3479,2894,267,634,3479,22069,29892,2257,439,29915,309,12242,1249,316,872,18165,266,1572,412,329,1387,29892,373,3964,14150,427,301,29915,328,852,29892,427,13159,598,966,508,22543,29892,443,18765,424,316,301,29915,29948,1545,29948,3364,291,1750,27442,568,875,2267,882,2298,6366,815,634,11387,316,301,29915,29872,2192,29889,7747,439,29915,309,8556,282,681,344,946,381,11555,427,1298,285,1794,569,1465,301,29915,1893,277,434,23900,261,29892,373,263,24889,29948,712,425,3829,553,325,4582,2925,427,3209,4625,470,427,301,29915,1893,277,434,23900,261,23900,261,707,12694,2016,316,14344,270,29915,1893,277,434,4107,29889,6803,443,2653,19505,29892,7015,325,4582,2925,363,358,443,5291,29891,585,10112,12031,29875,519,29889,17812,6309,712,1671,553,6808,375,23900,261,29892,2257,5291,29891,585,22847,553,25226,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,338,1811,304,7602,1239,278,20026,393,1009,7972,1650,304,23900,14502,338,11828,322,756,28145,2625,9545,1135,13807,8950,1228,27580,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,362,338,451,1407,17953,3277,322,425,4684,16667,16165,261,663,29889,13,13,10605,526,777,9590,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,16726,393,1009,1650,674,376,6229,14150,427,301,29915,328,852,29908,313,17469,278,437,344,29897,322,376,2987,358,424,316,301,29915,29948,1545,29948,3364,291,29908,313,262,1037,559,278,5864,3233,511,541,727,338,694,16021,10757,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,512,2114,29892,1784,11898,505,4318,393,27668,278,437,344,310,8950,1228,27580,508,3275,304,263,6133,12045,310,23900,1162,26841,29889,13,29906,29889,20929,5062,11235,310,23900,4768,3002,29901,450,25657,2444,304,367,16051,278,6964,310,376,12765,3958,29908,411,278,9677,310,23900,9101,297,278,3573,29889,1815,2265,9101,437,451,2923,1509,20459,10106,278,3573,29936,3265,29892,896,1101,2702,2224,1994,322,7208,12903,393,2758,963,304,9725,403,322,8104,675,716,11840,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,19220,310,916,13879,29901,450,25657,947,451,2125,964,3633,916,4100,13879,393,508,6602,23900,14502,29892,1316,408,278,16500,29915,29879,12463,9045,4660,29892,1009,2531,7492,8722,29892,322,278,2702,21862,310,1009,23900,24876,19263,29889,13,29946,29889,853,8551,5900,29901,450,25657,432,17204,1546,1422,7014,1728,16791,963,1480,1711,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,376,29873,8631,585,10112,12031,29875,519,29908,313,29874,10112,1004,519,260,4003,29897,1728,24232,920,372,1104,1078,304,23900,14502,29889,13,29945,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,322,23205,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,2821,322,2560,3307,363,278,20026,304,5948,2274,29889,2688,671,16905,4958,322,4280,25260,393,1122,367,5189,363,1661,29899,735,546,1372,304,1101,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,16392,1122,367,1781,29892,1009,2980,362,338,451,1532,29899,4984,2955,470,6969,491,10757,29892,607,298,513,414,1009,11509,304,7602,1239,278,20026,310,1009,7972,1650,29889],"total_duration":82512179455,"load_duration":174532,"prompt_eval_count":271,"prompt_eval_duration":24824795000,"eval_count":446,"eval_duration":57686712000}
