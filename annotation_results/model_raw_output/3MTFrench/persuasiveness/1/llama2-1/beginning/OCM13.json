Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker presents some convincing arguments about the growth of tourism and its potential impact on the local economy. They highlight the impressive numbers of tourists visiting France each year and how it has become a major source of revenue for the country. However, the speaker's tone is more promotional than persuasive, as they seem to be more focused on selling the idea of tourism rather than presenting a well-reasoned argument.\n\nRigor of Reasoning: The speaker makes some logical connections between the growth of tourism and its potential impact on the local economy. For example, they mention that the number of tourists visiting France has increased significantly in recent years, which has led to an increase in revenue for the country. However, the speaker's reasoning is not always rigorous, as they make some general statements without providing enough evidence to support them. For instance, the speaker says that the local economy needs more tools to accommodate tourists, but they do not provide any specific examples or data to back up this claim.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments, their tone and reasoning could be more persuasive and rigorous, respectively.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,438,16099,966,521,2593,690,868,6371,6386,29889,16579,802,19951,29892,980,6728,29889,8748,274,29915,342,9577,6079,29889,2169,19755,29920,427,29871,29906,29900,29896,29955,29889,10016,26744,1190,29871,29955,1465,454,9122,263,12278,351,29948,26269,316,425,3814,12973,29889,29871,30219,29874,7905,325,1300,712,301,29915,29949,29916,277,6067,707,425,29871,29946,29872,14326,316,3444,1671,425,4810,29902,553,6371,9230,23428,13873,29889,8748,29871,1654,29892,454,6371,6386,29892,274,29915,342,443,953,1129,347,1190,29871,29896,29900,29889,29871,30219,29874,7905,325,1300,712,301,29915,348,20854,355,28759,316,8689,29871,4277,409,454,17792,28504,21609,524,316,16573,316,29871,29941,29900,29900,14746,270,29915,513,3640,375,29889,478,681,7890,19643,29920,16731,29871,29941,29900,29900,14746,29892,274,29915,342,17256,10098,425,4665,11076,29889,8748,6079,19601,29892,1444,26099,7602,475,4979,712,301,29915,29949,29916,277,6067,263,9411,966,818,5646,1671,3999,1411,267,5278,15217,3132,15340,29889,838,943,14034,29920,29889,461,1006,768,487,4191,454,302,30069,2484,8164,9073,1671,3999,1411,267,29973,315,29915,342,13164,6371,2488,29889,478,681,29892,18097,7890,17751,482,29920,29899,23088,8992,29920,553,1634,5908,29973,8748,6079,19601,29892,1444,282,1947,712,966,6371,9230,1399,993,5695,29892,373,3008,28230,316,1634,5908,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,712,432,29915,1794,5291,6309,553,6851,29889,341,532,895,2123,409,10484,276,1190,9411,966,714,2719,1750,14924,509,609,270,29915,5753,434,453,381,29889,4649,533,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,2831,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,1048,278,14321,310,6282,1608,322,967,7037,10879,373,278,1887,26504,29889,2688,12141,278,21210,573,3694,310,6282,2879,6493,292,3444,1269,1629,322,920,372,756,4953,263,4655,2752,310,337,9947,363,278,4234,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16225,338,901,2504,327,1848,1135,20408,294,573,29892,408,896,2833,304,367,901,21309,373,269,7807,278,2969,310,6282,1608,3265,1135,2198,292,263,1532,29899,23147,287,2980,29889,13,13,29934,335,272,310,830,1658,292,29901,450,25657,3732,777,16667,12368,1546,278,14321,310,6282,1608,322,967,7037,10879,373,278,1887,26504,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,278,1353,310,6282,2879,6493,292,3444,756,11664,16951,297,7786,2440,29892,607,756,5331,304,385,7910,297,337,9947,363,278,4234,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,408,896,1207,777,2498,9506,1728,13138,3307,10757,304,2304,963,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,4083,393,278,1887,26504,4225,901,8492,304,24803,403,6282,2879,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,1009,16225,322,24481,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29892,8307,29889],"total_duration":64786653912,"load_duration":215109,"prompt_eval_count":303,"prompt_eval_duration":27561072000,"eval_count":292,"eval_duration":37224862000}
