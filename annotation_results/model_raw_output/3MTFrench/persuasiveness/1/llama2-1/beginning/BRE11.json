{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T10:42:52.141439609Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of clarity and coherence: The speech is difficult to follow due to the lack of clear structure and coherence. The speaker jumps between different topics and ideas without connecting them logically, making it challenging for the audience to understand the message.\n2. Unclear or misleading arguments: The speaker presents some arguments that are unclear or misleading. For example, the comparison between sour mice and cancer is not a valid one, as sour mice are a minor pest compared to the complexity of cancer. Additionally, the idea of using a \"piège à tu meurs\" (a French phrase meaning \"death trap\") to treat cancer is not only unethical but also lacks scientific basis.\n3. Lack of evidence: The speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or research to support their claims, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed solution.\n4. Unclear conclusion: The speaker's conclusion is unclear and lacks a clear call to action. It is not evident what the speaker wants the audience to do after listening to their speech.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's passion and enthusiasm for their topic are evident, their message could benefit from clearer structure, more accurate arguments, and a stronger evidence base.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,1794,1597,9577,286,585,1564,895,15217,29889,478,327,276,18234,707,3041,342,1318,316,269,473,275,29889,11001,267,3435,760,449,29889,838,943,29892,439,29915,30001,966,7890,9073,1577,838,11867,29899,23088,29892,818,301,29915,3027,553,269,29915,264,326,1691,316,3436,29926,688,4745,29892,610,19406,479,270,29915,5474,29899,24442,316,26814,18234,29889,11948,3669,854,6096,29899,23088,29892,425,1436,316,301,29915,29948,12907,29892,425,269,473,1924,707,15237,18916,29889,438,29884,818,301,29915,5903,283,28185,9373,29892,274,29915,342,10767,29884,29892,521,562,1540,553,269,473,275,634,966,904,2576,1475,634,966,26809,302,29915,29874,16573,966,10890,29889,11948,3058,267,269,473,275,29892,7890,634,18402,1298,15237,29889,838,943,29892,269,30095,276,358,29892,7890,10420,406,29920,818,16454,3657,1308,443,2930,15532,818,269,473,275,29889,11948,1190,634,29899,309,1950,270,29915,932,506,261,2257,2560,18836,17239,818,425,15481,371,8474,454,23900,1577,19551,802,425,521,457,7251,720,29948,2390,347,29892,1750,3209,371,5646,1190,1487,13382,634,425,13219,2390,347,269,29915,29891,1999,29948,29892,452,18165,484,2331,29889,2448,1671,1080,29899,29876,681,2331,3667,7608,443,2930,15532,818,5291,592,1295,29889,951,541,316,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,4327,261,5278,1178,1318,427,22259,2131,29889,3219,269,473,1924,29892,274,29915,342,454,5857,711,4230,290,29892,10440,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,322,16165,261,663,29901,450,12032,338,5189,304,1101,2861,304,278,10225,310,2821,3829,322,16165,261,663,29889,450,25657,432,17204,1546,1422,23820,322,7014,1728,16791,963,1480,1711,29892,3907,372,18066,292,363,278,20026,304,2274,278,2643,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,470,3984,25369,6273,29901,450,25657,22981,777,6273,393,526,20871,470,3984,25369,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,10230,1546,269,473,286,625,322,23900,338,451,263,2854,697,29892,408,269,473,286,625,526,263,9461,282,342,9401,304,278,13644,310,23900,29889,19814,29892,278,2969,310,773,263,376,1631,15532,818,5291,592,1295,29908,313,29874,5176,16549,6593,376,311,493,26505,1159,304,7539,23900,338,451,871,443,621,936,541,884,425,4684,16021,8405,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,5925,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,3907,372,5189,304,14707,278,2779,20193,310,1009,7972,1650,29889,13,29946,29889,853,8551,15997,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,15997,338,20871,322,425,4684,263,2821,1246,304,3158,29889,739,338,451,13602,825,278,25657,10753,278,20026,304,437,1156,19866,304,1009,12032,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,23644,3173,29885,363,1009,11261,526,13602,29892,1009,2643,1033,14169,515,26135,3829,29892,901,16232,6273,29892,322,263,23505,10757,2967,29889],"total_duration":66809003633,"load_duration":151148,"prompt_eval_count":287,"prompt_eval_duration":26364429000,"eval_count":318,"eval_duration":40443944000}
