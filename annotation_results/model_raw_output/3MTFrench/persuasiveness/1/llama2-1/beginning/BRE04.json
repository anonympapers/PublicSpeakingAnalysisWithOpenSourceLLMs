The speaker provides some interesting insights into the microorganisms that live in the sediment at the bottom of the ocean, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic to help establish their credibility and expertise. While they mention that they are studying these microorganisms as part of their research, they do not provide any details on what kind of research it is or how they are studying them. Providing more information on the methodology and significance of their research could have helped to build trust with the audience.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker provides some interesting facts about the microorganisms' ability to survive without oxygen, they do not provide a clear explanation for why this is the case. They simply state that these organisms can \"vivre temporairement sans oxyg√®ne,\" but they do not elaborate on how this is possible or what mechanisms allow them to survive in such conditions. Providing more detail on the biology and physiology of these organisms could have helped to make their argument more persuasive.\n\nFinally, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claim that these microorganisms are \"incroyables\" or \"amis ni faire.\" While they mention that they are studying these organisms as part of their research, they do not provide any specific examples or data to illustrate their points. Providing more concrete examples or statistics could have helped to make their argument more convincing and persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the microorganisms that live in the sediment at the bottom of the ocean, there are areas where they could have strengthened their argument by providing more context, detail, and evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1174,2257,3256,29892,7209,7890,7697,276,16731,29892,7890,4613,533,29920,316,301,29915,2251,4790,8146,634,1518,381,261,868,762,29884,19100,680,316,1559,15933,29889,11948,2257,302,29915,342,2331,3682,9139,29892,7847,802,425,4655,2131,553,29871,30037,5888,9364,1934,22700,296,2257,4464,316,4613,12232,29889,6803,1465,4883,25902,316,260,294,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,818,316,26134,21337,2894,1608,267,1766,1144,15390,316,9364,276,5382,5218,358,7209,288,3594,29887,8146,1465,454,274,2487,2073,29892,2257,269,519,1750,18751,5582,454,6299,553,286,5908,634,553,12954,29948,550,29889,11948,1750,3435,7015,5528,4727,1849,454,9200,29899,6388,6386,29892,2257,3435,553,363,626,275,6836,9073,29892,4191,1661,291,1089,18916,1559,293,1337,29948,29871,1654,610,1661,29875,29892,980,18475,6967,818,316,5697,1169,1302,339,453,1179,3503,2257,452,3435,6836,553,3778,2993,6836,553,289,627,29948,2722,29889,365,29915,3318,361,316,425,8861,8691,316,611,260,28334,707,316,7199,9030,425,6316,316,1661,29875,634,3435,12471,17239,20674,3783,29889,405,5271,13901,1465,443,21334,2484,427,480,14785,29892,443,21334,2484,29892,274,29915,342,1597,2723,29894,2353,270,29915,14531,316,286,5908,2637,553,7629,4211,267,634,427,298,2147,454,260,11355,16053,280,424,553,2085,1934,1766,1144,302,29915,932,441,296,2331,9378,275,10460,270,29915,2251,4790,8146,1465,454,6299,316,425,2723,29894,2353,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,9200,6388,12903,393,5735,297,278,7048,2073,472,278,5970,310,278,23474,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,304,1371,10127,1009,6625,4127,322,17924,895,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,526,23382,1438,9200,6388,12903,408,760,310,1009,5925,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,373,825,2924,310,5925,372,338,470,920,896,526,23382,963,29889,9133,4821,901,2472,373,278,1158,3002,322,26002,310,1009,5925,1033,505,9213,304,2048,9311,411,278,20026,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,17099,1048,278,9200,6388,12903,29915,11509,304,10503,573,1728,288,28596,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,2821,8252,363,2020,445,338,278,1206,29889,2688,3763,2106,393,1438,2894,12903,508,376,24759,276,5382,5218,358,7209,288,3594,29887,8146,1699,541,896,437,451,19430,373,920,445,338,1950,470,825,7208,12903,2758,963,304,10503,573,297,1316,5855,29889,9133,4821,901,9493,373,278,4768,3002,322,4824,29875,3002,310,1438,2894,12903,1033,505,9213,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,1438,9200,6388,12903,526,376,3742,4727,1849,29908,470,376,314,275,6836,9073,1213,5806,896,3585,393,896,526,23382,1438,2894,12903,408,760,310,1009,5925,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,28475,1009,3291,29889,9133,4821,901,18387,6455,470,13964,1033,505,9213,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,322,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,9200,6388,12903,393,5735,297,278,7048,2073,472,278,5970,310,278,23474,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,505,9324,6419,1009,2980,491,13138,901,3030,29892,9493,29892,322,10757,29889],"total_duration":78030922051,"load_duration":163541,"prompt_eval_count":287,"prompt_eval_duration":26762927000,"eval_count":406,"eval_duration":51267395000}
