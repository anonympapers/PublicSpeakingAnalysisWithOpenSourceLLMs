{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T03:09:48.860740731Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker's message is not particularly convincing or well-reasoned. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes several claims without providing any evidence to support them. For example, they mention that muscles will melt on a trip to Mars without providing any scientific data or research to back up this claim.\n2. Unclear logic: The speaker’s argument that scientists are studying bears because they are the only animals that can resist muscle loss is unclear and illogical. It is not clear why bears would be the best animal to study in this context, or how their resistance to muscle loss would be relevant to a trip to Mars.\n3. Unpersuasive language: The speaker uses unpersuasive language throughout the speech, such as “moigné,” “ben,” and “rigourde.” This language does not convey confidence or authority, and can make the speaker’s message seem less convincing.\n4. Lack of clarity: The speaker’s argument is not particularly clear or well-defined. They jump between different topics and ideas without providing a clear structure or framework for their speech.\n\nOverall, while the speaker may have some interesting points to make about space travel and muscle loss, their message is not particularly persuasive or well-reasoned due to the lack of evidence, unclear logic, unpersuasive language, and lack of clarity in their argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,1354,1444,7890,1283,3780,443,17775,1190,16852,29892,373,21714,589,9318,425,301,1540,29892,5305,269,29915,1131,332,1600,634,427,623,29884,8146,1354,2730,647,29948,29889,838,11867,29892,5246,267,325,359,659,1575,316,13625,7890,29871,22730,12033,743,29889,4546,29875,29892,980,343,263,443,17887,1437,18237,712,432,29915,1794,2123,29890,492,29948,316,7890,3585,1089,29892,7890,4788,29920,7848,21609,524,270,29915,5474,2706,29899,735,1810,1908,29889,1174,26379,29892,325,359,2301,7799,325,609,6299,276,634,7209,2301,2841,29892,7890,452,10503,440,15749,2331,818,409,1020,1524,301,29915,265,17775,29889,997,3147,561,309,3077,1810,5218,707,818,8556,9411,9411,443,8694,2123,301,29915,18288,29889,10016,432,29915,264,18332,1465,454,715,6064,29892,443,599,17334,27044,29948,634,373,11113,20737,7814,2301,7799,29889,751,392,966,14954,1173,1295,409,364,3906,868,16731,712,2257,302,29915,14386,2331,1354,427,397,424,29892,11797,4625,13222,29948,966,3686,1759,1190,553,269,473,275,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,980,966,7697,4439,1943,29892,11797,6267,23371,993,2428,1020,17334,634,3856,29892,427,5246,29892,29871,4277,1766,1173,2331,29889,10043,316,1020,17334,29892,325,336,2073,6366,815,29889,838,943,29892,443,8694,29892,7015,14954,1173,1295,3435,1841,348,275,29889,8396,29892,14172,271,29892,1354,373,534,8885,443,302,9095,10696,325,532,802,29892,373,1671,8356,269,29915,524,1064,16136,818,443,13019,1750,6896,2488,5469,29880,944,818,425,639,371,2301,1810,5218,29889,2581,7890,633,29878,30037,479,818,10679,29892,3503,1487,1436,6311,20450,29948,270,29915,5753,536,29892,301,29915,2470,904,3228,882,274,29915,342,3911,439,29915,309,8556,21668,29889,838,943,29892,19601,1661,2298,29892,1444,302,29915,1794,2331,7199,275,966,9644,5646,316,9460,29892,3503,274,29915,342,12912,473,311,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,10734,17953,3277,470,1532,29899,23147,287,29889,2266,526,777,9590,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,3196,16726,1728,13138,738,10757,304,2304,963,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,393,2301,7799,674,286,2152,373,263,17487,304,16852,1728,13138,738,16021,848,470,5925,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,5900,29901,450,25657,30010,29879,2980,393,9638,2879,526,23382,367,1503,1363,896,526,278,871,15006,393,508,9241,2301,2841,6410,338,20871,322,980,1188,936,29889,739,338,451,2821,2020,367,1503,723,367,278,1900,13019,304,6559,297,445,3030,29892,470,920,1009,17711,304,2301,2841,6410,723,367,8018,304,263,17487,304,16852,29889,13,29941,29889,853,6774,29884,294,573,4086,29901,450,25657,3913,443,6774,29884,294,573,4086,10106,278,12032,29892,1316,408,1346,4346,647,29948,3995,1346,1785,3995,322,1346,8966,473,311,3178,910,4086,947,451,27769,16420,470,14329,29892,322,508,1207,278,25657,30010,29879,2643,2833,3109,17953,3277,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,29901,450,25657,30010,29879,2980,338,451,10734,2821,470,1532,29899,12119,29889,2688,12500,1546,1422,23820,322,7014,1728,13138,263,2821,3829,470,6890,363,1009,12032,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1122,505,777,8031,3291,304,1207,1048,2913,9850,322,2301,2841,6410,29892,1009,2643,338,451,10734,20408,294,573,470,1532,29899,23147,287,2861,304,278,10225,310,10757,29892,20871,5900,29892,443,6774,29884,294,573,4086,29892,322,10225,310,7542,537,297,1009,2980,29889],"total_duration":77606414969,"load_duration":292905,"prompt_eval_count":365,"prompt_eval_duration":33494657000,"eval_count":341,"eval_duration":44110925000}
