{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T12:59:29.232061816Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and emphasis to make their point, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by sharing a personal anecdote about helping a friend who works in the police archives, which helps to establish their credibility and expertise on the topic. They then explain how they use artificial intelligence to analyze handwriting samples and identify the author of a letter or document. The speaker provides some interesting insights into the way people write differently and how this can be used to identify them.\n\nHowever, there are some points where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker mentions that they use artificial intelligence to analyze handwriting samples, but they don't provide any details on how this is done or what specific techniques are used. Additionally, the speaker assumes that the police would benefit from using their services without providing any evidence to support this claim.\n\nOverall, while the speaker makes some persuasive points, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,349,824,1908,358,29892,432,29915,1794,4325,9996,29948,443,18926,1750,6427,8284,1465,454,2669,553,3190,3145,316,425,10974,29889,2581,7890,1029,283,29872,439,29915,309,302,29915,29874,18413,1120,424,316,22884,1465,872,6316,29889,1459,346,439,29915,309,302,29915,279,4401,2331,634,270,29915,424,3709,966,447,1082,1295,316,23563,10701,634,9484,284,1166,29889,2581,3911,766,712,1444,1236,1314,260,29915,29874,1241,29889,8748,18097,1444,26099,12567,2016,427,1871,15819,29892,1444,1841,29948,700,280,3911,7175,3476,261,712,274,29915,342,23068,818,1601,17887,22420,7289,634,1661,610,2535,4883,26809,712,432,29915,9864,275,301,29915,29874,1241,29889,1459,346,712,274,29915,342,925,882,2257,712,1444,16623,1465,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,14954,4630,634,270,29915,424,3709,1597,26744,270,29915,19908,1487,19694,545,29889,29871,30219,29874,7890,1702,13871,534,20372,29889,6803,339,7768,9073,1577,1459,17488,29892,1444,1236,1314,263,1241,425,10974,818,15882,301,29915,29874,19072,270,29915,1540,2432,4182,316,364,1144,424,29892,966,1235,5888,316,1757,815,29892,966,1235,5888,316,5227,1151,29892,782,6079,316,325,1064,3709,6267,260,7716,2131,868,12608,29889,365,29915,333,1318,712,432,29915,1794,904,6092,3667,7608,425,27965,1509,21082,19069,11381,1671,16455,643,29892,25238,13639,454,3114,270,29915,4582,768,545,316,7594,339,29915,348,29892,712,2257,12852,19694,427,7691,29892,427,16464,29892,782,29899,19521,375,316,301,29915,265,29889,4111,2123,29875,29892,18097,7890,4078,29920,29892,521,562,348,19694,2923,29948,1745,358,29892,1597,6701,26744,302,29915,4582,768,18413,316,3291,818,443,3184,316,425,6701,2258,15529,29889,838,943,29892,3440,9073,1577,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,19310,275,304,1207,1009,1298,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,19383,263,7333,385,687,29881,866,1048,19912,263,5121,1058,1736,297,278,10974,3190,3145,29892,607,6911,304,10127,1009,6625,4127,322,17924,895,373,278,11261,29889,2688,769,5649,920,896,671,23116,21082,304,27599,1361,16554,11916,322,12439,278,4148,310,263,5497,470,1842,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,982,2305,2436,17587,322,920,445,508,367,1304,304,12439,963,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,3291,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,671,23116,21082,304,27599,1361,16554,11916,29892,541,896,1016,29915,29873,3867,738,4902,373,920,445,338,2309,470,825,2702,13698,526,1304,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,15894,393,278,10974,723,14169,515,773,1009,5786,1728,13138,738,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3732,777,20408,294,573,3291,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":61102415062,"load_duration":172786,"prompt_eval_count":339,"prompt_eval_duration":29206308000,"eval_count":255,"eval_duration":31894219000}
