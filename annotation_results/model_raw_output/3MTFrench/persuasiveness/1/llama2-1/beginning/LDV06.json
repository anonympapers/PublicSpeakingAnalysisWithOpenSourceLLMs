The speaker effectively uses rhetorical questions and a sense of urgency to engage the audience and build interest in their research. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could provide more context about why the discovery of the CFTR channel is significant. While they mention that the CFTR channel regulates the transport of water, ions, and nutrients, they do not explain how this is relevant to the audience or why it matters. Providing more background information on the disease and its current treatments would help to build a stronger connection with the audience.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could provide more evidence to support their claim about the effectiveness of their research. While they mention that they are one of the few scientists working on this problem, they do not provide any data or studies to back up their claims. Adding more specific examples or references to reputable sources would help to build credibility and persuasiveness.\n\nOverall, while the speaker demonstrates some skill in crafting a convincing message, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based. With some adjustments to address these areas, the speaker could potentially increase their persuasiveness and engagement with the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,29941,6233,29892,1597,25740,29892,1597,22085,9061,29892,8556,599,787,9073,443,10169,3748,1671,7890,9073,18475,296,381,454,22884,270,29915,1540,1243,29889,8407,9587,316,2257,18308,29892,7890,29871,22730,29476,12031,1465,5278,269,3498,634,316,1147,15749,4356,276,553,427,29876,1355,1671,19397,18475,441,381,29889,2581,325,1759,9073,454,1539,2484,868,18308,818,7890,29899,19521,375,29899,27048,29889,1174,29871,29896,29929,29929,29929,29892,373,4224,5128,276,425,4556,316,425,341,1682,586,293,333,852,29889,951,17861,5659,29892,443,18643,1750,6367,352,20564,454,8608,270,29915,14531,29892,904,6149,261,634,452,18165,484,2331,29889,29310,499,271,29892,966,7446,29885,787,3435,427,6454,495,29948,29889,8748,966,22069,592,1295,10440,22572,29915,15669,316,5278,4439,328,347,6094,19971,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,966,14954,1173,1295,534,1355,1671,534,8885,553,5039,14075,868,17861,5659,29889,2581,26099,301,29915,348,2637,1314,29892,1444,26099,9411,966,7019,550,427,3814,634,7890,316,13325,2062,9030,4883,17124,6609,1354,7890,28078,11867,2656,381,316,5278,269,3498,29889,2581,7890,425,5582,443,2643,1190,27612,980,707,316,301,29915,4582,768,29892,4224,5128,276,634,2257,1750,6136,454,17861,5659,1465,1597,3038,1297,9505,29885,2681,533,29892,11323,29892,452,3006,1249,2331,16731,868,19723,538,29889,360,29915,14856,1318,29892,1444,7890,1083,19862,1759,553,2085,5707,29892,438,29950,4059,10578,29892,1750,12450,2016,301,29915,11236,2131,868,17861,5659,29889,997,2085,915,868,470,12450,2016,301,29915,11236,2131,4226,868,17861,5659,29889,8748,2535,966,521,2593,690,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,2831,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,263,4060,310,5065,14703,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,2048,4066,297,1009,5925,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,3030,1048,2020,278,20699,310,278,17861,5659,8242,338,7282,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,17861,5659,8242,24378,1078,278,8608,310,4094,29892,29871,1080,29892,322,18254,374,1237,29892,896,437,451,5649,920,445,338,8018,304,278,20026,470,2020,372,13750,29889,9133,4821,901,3239,2472,373,278,17135,322,967,1857,7539,1860,723,1371,304,2048,263,23505,3957,411,278,20026,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,1048,278,2779,20193,310,1009,5925,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,526,697,310,278,2846,9638,2879,1985,373,445,1108,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,848,470,11898,304,1250,701,1009,16726,29889,18804,901,2702,6455,470,9282,304,337,649,519,8974,723,1371,304,2048,6625,4127,322,20408,294,20193,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,9004,1078,777,19911,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889,2973,777,10365,1860,304,3211,1438,10161,29892,278,25657,1033,19998,7910,1009,20408,294,20193,322,3033,5049,411,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":62810423281,"load_duration":200396,"prompt_eval_count":319,"prompt_eval_duration":27068591000,"eval_count":289,"eval_duration":35741065000}
