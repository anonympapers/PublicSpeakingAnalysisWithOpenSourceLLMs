{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T22:47:18.281734499Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score the speech as a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and uses rhetorical devices effectively to make their point. However, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nThe speaker uses repetition and emphasis to drive home their message, which can be effective in engaging the audience and making them more receptive to the argument. For example, the speaker repeats the phrase \"I don't know\" several times throughout the speech, which adds weight to their argument that they are not pretending to have all the answers. Similarly, the use of rhetorical questions (\"But can we really trust...\", \"And what happens when...\") helps to engage the audience and encourage them to think more deeply about the issue at hand.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported. For example, the speaker's argument that the university should not be responsible for the debt of its students is based on a simplistic view of the relationship between the university and its students. The speaker does not consider the broader social and economic context in which higher education operates, or the ways in which universities can work to support their students beyond simply providing financial aid.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument that the university should not be responsible for the debt of its students because \"we are not a bank\" is based on an overly simplistic view of the role of universities and banks in society. Universities play a crucial role in shaping the minds and skills of future generations, and their responsibilities go beyond simply providing financial aid to students.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments, there are also areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects this mixed performance.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,319,582,289,1540,316,364,265,5338,29892,4948,29871,15700,29884,4404,885,1772,1236,454,29899,314,302,1654,29889,12487,20805,5530,1015,13804,29892,1236,425,29889,12487,325,585,12381,29899,29880,503,17829,2723,289,457,29892,425,12381,337,2112,29875,10037,316,289,457,29892,1236,2562,270,30035,29885,29892,425,4948,3737,271,10037,1236,4948,29889,2448,29892,4948,3737,271,10037,1236,454,29892,263,325,30057,9877,30035,29892,2257,1925,1236,2562,270,30035,29885,2723,2257,503,272,352,29892,22169,2257,2961,288,443,2723,479,316,454,29874,425,731,983,29892,321,14387,895,316,1236,24274,941,29892,29871,30944,31081,29889,12487,29871,15700,29875,263,2257,29899,29880,503,272,352,3526,285,30035,29880,1236,341,1540,29892,288,2562,425,4948,2005,274,457,29889,12487,452,29910,29964,2650,29875,425,6035,272,29892,1302,29899,336,30067,18165,352,5530,29889,1205,5777,452,472,276,1925,425,3700,1236,282,566,29884,2039,488,4209,1146,10037,2961,2460,364,16571,4966,288,5291,21643,5427,4209,13294,582,29920,488,2723,2257,4697,260,1297,280,29892,1321,16354,1833,29946,29953,286,30035,29920,403,3526,478,9919,29889,5952,1032,287,5638,2653,790,19548,277,425,1236,772,403,29889,319,285,30035,29880,321,423,285,9992,14973,22767,29892,270,19287,2411,13725,29873,5424,302,603,10096,14051,347,441,29892,16430,503,277,1006,4210,316,872,2562,3708,4948,694,29875,423,856,2023,22901,336,2562,25338,316,2236,2731,29872,1362,1236,19013,2723,29899,585,2023,29886,487,280,472,27292,279,309,29892,501,509,355,2236,29892,4948,16577,4948,263,4948,4404,408,29877,30382,29874,30057,29880,364,2159,7468,2116,277,5338,13294,29873,403,17564,29875,14783,2023,392,16577,4948,9523,1657,758,649,30242,782,19287,316,9541,4956,279,352,3938,1652,29883,928,282,1114,5777,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,17583,304,1207,1009,1298,29889,2398,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3913,21159,654,322,19310,275,304,7899,3271,1009,2643,29892,607,508,367,11828,297,3033,6751,278,20026,322,3907,963,901,337,1547,573,304,278,2980,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,5565,1446,278,16549,376,29902,1016,29915,29873,1073,29908,3196,3064,10106,278,12032,29892,607,12778,7688,304,1009,2980,393,896,526,451,14794,2548,304,505,599,278,6089,29889,20175,29892,278,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,4852,6246,508,591,2289,9311,856,613,376,2855,825,5930,746,856,1159,6911,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,13731,6617,963,304,1348,901,24344,1048,278,2228,472,1361,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,16372,881,451,367,14040,363,278,2553,29873,310,967,8041,338,2729,373,263,5466,4695,1776,310,278,9443,1546,278,16372,322,967,8041,29889,450,25657,947,451,2050,278,2545,1664,5264,322,17407,3030,297,607,6133,9793,1751,1078,29892,470,278,5837,297,607,4946,1907,508,664,304,2304,1009,8041,8724,3763,13138,18161,16226,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,16372,881,451,367,14040,363,278,2553,29873,310,967,8041,1363,376,705,526,451,263,9124,29908,338,2729,373,385,975,368,5466,4695,1776,310,278,6297,310,4946,1907,322,24388,297,12459,29889,2116,1907,1708,263,7618,1455,6297,297,528,21430,278,27656,322,25078,310,5434,1176,800,29892,322,1009,5544,747,9770,748,8724,3763,13138,18161,16226,304,8041,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,884,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,445,12849,4180,29889],"total_duration":85543867555,"load_duration":237331,"prompt_eval_count":351,"prompt_eval_duration":31743994000,"eval_count":422,"eval_duration":53799148000}
