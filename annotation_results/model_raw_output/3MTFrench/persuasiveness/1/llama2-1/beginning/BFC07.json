The speaker provides some valid points and examples to support their argument, but there are also some logical fallacies and lack of rigorous reasoning that detract from the overall effectiveness of the speech.\n\nThe speaker's use of anecdotes and personal experiences helps to establish a connection with the audience and makes the message more relatable. However, the lack of clear evidence and data to support the claims makes it difficult to fully convinced the audience of the speaker's position. Additionally, the speaker's reliance on hyperbole and exaggerated language (e.g., \"un feu d'artifice du digital\") detracts from the credibility of the argument.\n\nIn terms of rigorous reasoning, the speaker's argument relies heavily on ad hominem attacks and strawman fallacies, rather than addressing the actual points made by the other side. The speaker also fails to provide a clear definition or explanation of the term \"Ã©commerce en vendeur,\" which makes it difficult for the audience to understand the speaker's position.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's use of anecdotes and personal experiences is effective in establishing a connection with the audience, the lack of rigorous reasoning and evidence detracts from the persuasiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,27677,454,4048,6390,29892,7890,8992,29920,7209,270,2663,782,11387,1597,10098,1518,1064,2073,29948,301,29915,21708,270,29915,29872,1314,18643,7719,29889,853,17488,29892,274,29915,342,425,5273,3901,332,316,29088,29891,29892,1601,26713,18926,29892,634,432,29915,1794,4224,24969,868,9073,443,26379,330,13796,521,542,324,271,29889,8748,1671,29871,4277,29892,1444,325,1759,1190,16631,1671,378,1100,1089,553,29869,316,1162,2353,29889,8748,18916,29892,274,29915,342,443,20491,270,29915,442,28833,868,13436,29889,1551,592,282,681,344,553,29869,29892,553,1162,21158,316,2723,275,457,29892,553,318,303,1934,29899,1270,29880,29892,553,29442,3110,1219,29892,289,999,29892,553,970,7719,1190,13327,29889,2581,337,28671,443,7446,479,270,29915,326,295,29899,280,29627,1190,5345,519,29873,29889,8748,782,2186,29892,432,29915,496,12973,1601,20207,316,1162,2353,29892,712,1444,301,29915,1794,1841,5231,16555,454,7431,2310,475,1465,443,1298,10208,275,29889,5202,276,358,6309,29892,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,818,3657,1308,2535,1601,13745,6710,2011,519,29892,2186,11728,454,29627,1190,5345,519,29873,29892,454,5646,263,1083,609,29948,270,29915,1639,2467,3132,29892,2298,289,4582,1524,29892,282,21167,29948,610,301,29915,29948,22529,427,325,3324,332,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,2257,20491,270,29915,442,28833,868,13436,29892,2257,7090,1597,8774,3068,1387,577,29888,19971,634,652,19388,1387,29892,22624,16444,1318,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,8128,777,2854,3291,322,6455,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,541,727,526,884,777,16667,285,9864,2478,322,10225,310,12912,20657,24481,393,1439,1461,515,278,12463,2779,20193,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,385,687,29881,4769,322,7333,27482,6911,304,10127,263,3957,411,278,20026,322,3732,278,2643,901,1104,17219,29889,2398,29892,278,10225,310,2821,10757,322,848,304,2304,278,16726,3732,372,5189,304,8072,25617,278,20026,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2602,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,12536,749,373,11266,833,280,322,429,9921,630,4086,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,348,20491,270,29915,442,28833,868,13436,1159,1439,1461,29879,515,278,6625,4127,310,278,2980,29889,13,13,797,4958,310,12912,20657,24481,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,594,3632,262,331,16661,322,380,1610,1171,285,9864,2478,29892,3265,1135,3211,292,278,3935,3291,1754,491,278,916,2625,29889,450,25657,884,8465,304,3867,263,2821,5023,470,8252,310,278,1840,376,29948,22529,427,325,3324,332,1699,607,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,2602,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,385,687,29881,4769,322,7333,27482,338,11828,297,10127,292,263,3957,411,278,20026,29892,278,10225,310,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,1439,1461,29879,515,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":62062476258,"load_duration":258278,"prompt_eval_count":285,"prompt_eval_duration":24516797000,"eval_count":300,"eval_duration":37544835000}
