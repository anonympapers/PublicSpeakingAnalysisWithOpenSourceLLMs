The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and emotion to convey their message and build an argument. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nThe speaker starts by highlighting the frustration and disappointment with the airline company's frequent delays and cancellations, which helps to establish a sense of shared experience and emotional connection with the audience. They then provide specific examples of incidents that have occurred due to equipment failures, which serves to illustrate the scale of the problem.\n\nThe speaker also proposes a potential solution by mentioning the use of new tools from artificial intelligence to prevent equipment failures. While this may be seen as a positive and innovative approach, it is not entirely clear how these tools would work or what specific benefits they would bring.\n\nOne area where the reasoning could be more rigorous is in the justification of why equipment failures are the primary cause of delays and cancellations. While the speaker mentions that most incidents are due to equipment failures, it would be helpful to provide more data or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more detail on how the proposed solution would address the root causes of the problem rather than just its symptoms.\n\nOverall, while the speech is effective in conveying emotion and building an argument, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based support to make a stronger case.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,29896,29900,6233,29871,29941,29900,6233,29871,29896,29892,29871,29941,26893,270,29915,29882,441,279,29892,1700,29892,2889,352,1318,29892,343,427,263,1766,276,553,3240,3163,29892,274,29915,342,15237,9541,309,2535,712,1444,16067,23469,2298,18413,5278,29868,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,8556,1029,787,20737,5646,269,29915,28141,1465,15093,2852,271,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,966,1700,29879,4625,868,3240,538,634,373,263,301,29915,326,2590,712,29871,4277,6454,915,15237,1190,8556,29889,8748,1465,5278,298,6844,29892,274,29915,342,639,21941,639,21941,439,29915,348,818,301,29915,19880,2267,475,9013,895,553,1302,30095,1372,9577,1053,1934,1671,425,29868,634,6267,18332,1597,6079,286,585,1564,895,1967,29889,8396,29892,4439,20792,5646,29892,373,2947,2331,289,1759,643,966,13137,29889,6101,373,1072,19755,270,29915,348,7006,2298,16573,29892,373,269,29915,7202,28671,712,425,715,786,442,316,7015,5528,16719,3435,270,30095,818,553,7243,267,1190,553,20075,4110,553,1029,1080,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,712,432,29915,1639,1403,575,29889,3067,29883,2663,29920,6079,29892,1444,325,1759,260,5893,270,29915,4422,7608,553,10984,2993,714,2719,6003,424,316,301,29915,524,28286,19069,11381,18934,270,29915,5903,1524,7015,7243,267,29889,838,943,29892,427,544,15819,29892,712,2257,715,579,457,29889,997,29868,27905,270,29915,1540,1652,14360,270,29915,485,291,634,18402,1029,291,263,13374,4211,29948,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,953,8194,304,27769,1009,2643,322,2048,385,2980,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,12141,292,278,1424,11036,322,23451,358,411,278,4799,1220,5001,29915,29879,17091,628,1036,322,508,3729,800,29892,607,6911,304,10127,263,4060,310,7258,7271,322,23023,1848,3957,411,278,20026,29889,2688,769,3867,2702,6455,310,5528,16719,393,505,10761,2861,304,21083,4418,1973,29892,607,19700,304,28475,278,6287,310,278,1108,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,9551,267,263,7037,1650,491,3585,292,278,671,310,716,8492,515,23116,21082,304,5557,21083,4418,1973,29889,5806,445,1122,367,3595,408,263,6374,322,24233,1230,2948,29892,372,338,451,9186,2821,920,1438,8492,723,664,470,825,2702,23633,896,723,6963,29889,13,13,6716,4038,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,338,297,278,925,2450,310,2020,21083,4418,1973,526,278,7601,4556,310,628,1036,322,508,3729,800,29889,5806,278,25657,26649,393,1556,5528,16719,526,2861,304,21083,4418,1973,29892,372,723,367,8444,304,3867,901,848,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,9493,373,920,278,7972,1650,723,3211,278,3876,9946,310,278,1108,3265,1135,925,967,25828,4835,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,11828,297,378,345,5414,953,8194,322,5214,385,2980,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,2304,304,1207,263,23505,1206,29889],"total_duration":68882105290,"load_duration":149798,"prompt_eval_count":285,"prompt_eval_duration":26298424000,"eval_count":339,"eval_duration":42582940000}
