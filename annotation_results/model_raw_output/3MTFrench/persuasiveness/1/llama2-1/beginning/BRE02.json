{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T10:49:47.64608629Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker does an adequate job of crafting a convincing message and presenting their argument, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more persuasive.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that the speaker starts by using a relatable scenario (thinking of something after 9 months vs 6 weeks) to grab the audience's attention and create a sense of familiarity. They then transition smoothly into their main point, which is that they are an expert in their field and have a specialty in accompanying and understanding emotional moments for parents and their little ones.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could be more persuasive. For example, they use a bit of jargon (\"fenouill√©\") which may not be immediately clear to the audience and could make their message less accessible. Additionally, while the speaker mentions that their agency has a goal of selling produce to parents, they don't provide much detail on how they plan to achieve this goal or what sets them apart from other companies in the market.\n\nOverall, the speaker does a good job of presenting their message, but could benefit from adding more specific details and examples to make their argument more compelling and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,1794,1597,1139,1671,7890,2257,29627,2529,9854,29889,6101,1444,7890,766,29871,29929,17478,29892,7890,282,1947,29920,818,1577,9070,29892,6094,616,29889,11948,16134,424,29892,1354,1444,7890,766,29871,29953,3031,13116,29892,9515,29892,9515,29892,29871,4277,452,7890,610,280,2331,29889,382,29882,6079,1671,29873,424,29892,1444,610,280,316,425,6701,12784,29892,3503,1465,611,23662,2131,29892,454,18371,283,23589,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,1444,26099,4581,29899,30062,10936,29899,29931,29915,29909,1505,276,29889,6803,18371,283,23589,29889,8396,29892,3431,29889,11948,432,29915,1794,301,29915,351,663,270,29915,562,2388,18303,634,316,7199,9030,9411,7015,2298,367,585,19462,270,29915,2249,8194,1671,23872,634,611,767,29888,1690,347,29892,425,1055,9948,316,10713,10505,324,747,743,289,10126,743,18371,283,453,583,29889,951,2298,367,585,11510,631,868,9122,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,9411,966,1209,4285,447,375,344,29889,6803,1597,2637,7734,409,767,455,1908,29892,425,5802,316,409,286,749,263,1671,541,270,29915,5474,9691,29884,782,544,2487,2249,279,29948,11555,29892,7847,274,29915,342,1766,5606,11555,19398,316,7015,10918,9351,782,544,2487,440,283,1136,3011,7289,29889,11948,1354,7015,409,767,1760,452,432,29915,1794,443,760,29892,454,1766,5606,11555,452,8164,2331,325,9030,316,10918,9351,29889,7740,424,316,12912,2853,29892,818,7890,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,385,19967,339,403,4982,310,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,292,1009,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,8665,491,773,263,1104,17219,10483,313,386,18159,310,1554,1156,29871,29929,7378,7186,29871,29953,11405,29897,304,17229,278,20026,29915,29879,8570,322,1653,263,4060,310,9985,537,29889,2688,769,9558,10597,368,964,1009,1667,1298,29892,607,338,393,896,526,385,17924,297,1009,1746,322,505,263,4266,1017,297,10259,1384,292,322,8004,23023,1848,19462,363,11825,322,1009,2217,6743,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,671,263,2586,310,432,1191,265,4852,11350,283,23589,1159,607,1122,451,367,7389,2821,304,278,20026,322,1033,1207,1009,2643,3109,15579,29889,19814,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,393,1009,946,3819,756,263,7306,310,269,7807,7738,304,11825,29892,896,1016,29915,29873,3867,1568,9493,373,920,896,3814,304,6176,445,7306,470,825,6166,963,12435,515,916,14582,297,278,9999,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2643,29892,541,1033,14169,515,4417,901,2702,4902,322,6455,304,1207,1009,2980,901,752,7807,322,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":62895727540,"load_duration":162589,"prompt_eval_count":275,"prompt_eval_duration":25348862000,"eval_count":291,"eval_duration":37546322000}
