{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T19:49:27.230551797Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses personal anecdotes and emotional appeals to make their argument more relatable and impactful. However, the reasoning behind their claims could be more rigorous and supported by concrete evidence.\n\nThe speaker's use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios helps to engage the audience and create a sense of empathy. For example, when they ask \"What if tomorrow never comes?\", it creates a sense of urgency and encourages the audience to take action. Similarly, their use of repetition (\"Je commence le sport, et tous les lendemains me suivent\") helps to drive home their message and make it more memorable.\n\nHowever, the speaker's claims could benefit from more scientific evidence to support their arguments. For instance, they mention the potential risks associated with smoking without providing any data or studies to back up their claims. Additionally, the speaker's use of generalizations (\"Tous ces messages sont ni adaptées à nos habitudes de vie\") could be more nuanced and take into account individual differences in how people respond to different forms of communication.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in using emotional appeals and personal anecdotes to make their argument more persuasive, they could benefit from incorporating more scientific evidence and rigorous reasoning to make their case more compelling.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8748,274,29915,342,5646,26269,316,7890,29892,286,17914,360,2603,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,316,285,398,1318,29892,1444,24108,454,7980,29892,634,9411,966,7431,2310,2708,592,10252,296,1261,475,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,316,285,398,1318,29889,8748,1444,24108,454,7980,818,301,29915,16063,457,10098,316,2298,29892,980,269,29915,29891,3948,9061,29892,634,274,29915,342,15237,2331,6628,1314,7980,29889,8748,1354,454,6773,818,409,364,568,29892,980,2473,572,347,3999,5161,1912,316,4439,328,583,1750,564,374,794,818,409,274,8584,29889,6803,29873,424,29892,980,263,13003,634,18679,4191,8556,9411,29871,1654,553,752,4211,267,316,7175,7316,29892,1671,3948,30037,357,316,285,398,1318,634,1671,289,692,261,2298,29889,5791,25698,5000,302,29915,342,2331,443,767,802,316,17385,362,2123,316,24792,29948,29892,782,6761,533,29889,323,681,7015,7191,3435,6836,7744,2406,818,7814,29892,270,29915,7308,4279,316,6316,452,6836,2022,5711,261,29889,997,1650,1671,8356,7848,1597,2280,316,16317,296,29948,29892,4067,1318,818,553,5446,1691,316,20877,29948,4511,2406,4191,553,16703,1973,270,29915,11236,2131,29892,1671,8556,263,1241,818,1874,261,1411,519,358,7814,4760,8192,316,6316,29889,2598,18848,316,266,17449,302,29915,342,2331,20498,882,316,9484,261,5278,2280,270,29915,562,2388,4211,882,15001,5711,1318,868,5161,802,5881,29875,586,6151,1070,29892,3503,316,7175,862,261,12563,301,29915,262,14867,12425,29892,301,29915,264,5815,30058,17239,1480,1387,29892,1750,19172,336,3479,19313,7664,11689,316,13942,29877,2496,5278,2280,29889,8748,1671,712,5278,2280,12852,6366,815,29892,980,21668,439,29915,1808,2653,5582,27516,553,5178,2719,15001,5711,743,818,18402,20077,316,5161,802,5881,29875,586,6151,1070,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,7333,385,687,29881,4769,322,23023,1848,5929,1338,304,1207,1009,2980,901,1104,17219,322,10879,1319,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,5742,1009,16726,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,18387,10757,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,13752,300,936,21846,6911,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1653,263,4060,310,953,2084,29891,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,896,2244,376,5618,565,6454,22396,2360,5304,29973,613,372,10017,263,4060,310,5065,14703,322,18443,267,278,20026,304,2125,3158,29889,20175,29892,1009,671,310,21159,654,4852,13836,24108,454,7980,29892,634,9411,966,7431,2310,2708,592,10252,296,1159,6911,304,7899,3271,1009,2643,322,1207,372,901,26959,519,29889,13,13,17245,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,1033,14169,515,901,16021,10757,304,2304,1009,6273,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,3585,278,7037,5161,2039,6942,411,1560,17223,1728,13138,738,848,470,11898,304,1250,701,1009,16726,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,2498,17063,4852,29911,681,7015,7191,3435,6836,7744,2406,818,7814,4760,8192,316,6316,1159,1033,367,901,4948,8362,322,2125,964,3633,5375,12651,297,920,2305,10049,304,1422,7190,310,12084,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,773,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,7333,385,687,29881,4769,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29892,896,1033,14169,515,11039,1218,901,16021,10757,322,12912,20657,24481,304,1207,1009,1206,901,752,7807,29889],"total_duration":71809261548,"load_duration":171559,"prompt_eval_count":349,"prompt_eval_duration":31566890000,"eval_count":319,"eval_duration":40241699000}
