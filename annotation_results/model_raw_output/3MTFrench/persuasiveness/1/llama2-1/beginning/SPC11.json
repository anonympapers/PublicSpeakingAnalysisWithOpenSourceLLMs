{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T19:39:26.137367413Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 on the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and emotional appeal to make their message convincing. They also provide specific examples and data to support their claims, demonstrating a rigorous reasoning.\n\nThe speaker starts by using a relatable scenario to grab the audience's attention, then gradually builds up to the main point of the speech, which is the importance of using new technologies in psychotherapy. They use repetition to emphasize the benefits of the new approach, such as \"Tout le monde connaît ce qu'elle\" and \"Moi, j'utilise ces nouvelles technologies\". The speaker also uses emotional appeal by sharing personal experiences, making the audience more likely to relate to them.\n\nThe speaker also provides concrete examples and data to support their claims, such as the success of the multifamily therapy project they worked on and the positive impact it had on families. They also use rhetorical questions to engage the audience and encourage them to think about the topic more deeply, such as \"Comment ça se passe?\"\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the speaker could improve to make their speech even more persuasive. For example, they could provide more specific data and statistics to support their claims, rather than just stating that the approach worked well. Additionally, they could have addressed potential counterarguments or objections to the new technology-based approach, such as concerns about privacy or the potential for technology to replace human interaction.\n\nOverall, the speaker does a good job of presenting a clear and convincing message, but there is room for improvement to make the speech even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,28079,454,9122,17043,13871,2257,439,29915,1808,29892,818,6267,1044,2491,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,1136,352,357,26814,25974,262,610,1998,29884,3479,12388,2925,634,6701,7848,1083,29890,2470,29948,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,4422,895,7015,26957,5722,11763,443,17887,21384,25595,553,2318,267,29889,838,943,29892,3440,1444,26099,274,29915,14386,270,29915,388,424,29973,349,5818,13545,8595,29892,1444,18848,11818,818,1601,885,283,29889,26383,4883,5321,20608,1041,29892,8556,1029,787,3984,427,2058,425,13219,2390,347,1773,361,1344,4379,1671,553,26943,427,13568,545,8645,424,29889,838,943,29892,3440,29871,4277,409,21714,29973,1551,364,465,6967,10741,5216,7545,1750,4625,316,330,359,344,2348,6947,569,634,373,13618,316,2318,267,1935,481,329,3783,15030,273,2406,29889,1174,1671,966,21038,29892,634,301,29915,18288,1671,6267,3847,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,26099,454,11643,1189,434,1465,443,11107,3847,284,29889,838,943,712,454,15744,1029,4564,29948,6079,29892,1444,766,19136,19844,611,11449,1791,261,427,3444,29889,6803,302,29915,342,2331,443,15115,265,1671,454,480,8107,29892,8556,1029,787,4224,24969,270,29915,29891,2420,388,634,270,29915,4422,7608,425,1998,29884,3479,1970,1064,2063,29889,2726,555,1759,29892,1791,424,4824,8105,882,29892,623,1306,29948,29892,432,29915,264,7468,1601,11107,316,11825,610,4685,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,23023,1848,25530,304,1207,1009,2643,17953,3277,29889,2688,884,3867,2702,6455,322,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,9004,1218,263,12912,20657,24481,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,773,263,1104,17219,10483,304,17229,278,20026,29915,29879,8570,29892,769,22020,23315,701,304,278,1667,1298,310,278,12032,29892,607,338,278,13500,310,773,716,5722,11763,297,11643,1228,27580,29889,2688,671,21159,654,304,19310,675,278,23633,310,278,716,2948,29892,1316,408,376,29911,449,454,9122,17043,13871,2257,439,29915,1808,29908,322,376,29924,7768,29892,432,29915,4422,895,7015,26957,5722,11763,1642,450,25657,884,3913,23023,1848,25530,491,19383,7333,27482,29892,3907,278,20026,901,5517,304,29279,304,963,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,8128,18387,6455,322,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,1316,408,278,2551,310,278,1773,361,1344,29891,29220,27580,2060,896,3796,373,322,278,6374,10879,372,750,373,13175,29889,2688,884,671,364,9188,272,936,5155,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,13731,6617,963,304,1348,1048,278,11261,901,24344,29892,1316,408,376,20001,29871,4277,409,21714,3026,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,263,2846,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,12032,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,3867,901,2702,848,322,13964,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,3265,1135,925,23659,393,278,2948,3796,1532,29889,19814,29892,896,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,704,24247,304,278,716,15483,29899,6707,2948,29892,1316,408,21838,1048,5999,4135,470,278,7037,363,15483,304,5191,5199,14881,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,263,2821,322,17953,3277,2643,29892,541,727,338,5716,363,20414,304,1207,278,12032,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":72330992032,"load_duration":247069,"prompt_eval_count":269,"prompt_eval_duration":24114207000,"eval_count":379,"eval_duration":48216082000}
