The speaker is able to effectively communicate their passion for Lego and their desire to understand the structure of an enzyme, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's argument that Lego can be used to understand the structure of an enzyme is somewhat tenuous. While it is true that Lego bricks can be used to build complex structures, it is not clear how this relates to the study of enzymes, which are complex biomolecules with specific structures and functions. The speaker does not provide any clear evidence or reasoning to support their claim that Lego can help us understand enzymes.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's language and tone can be somewhat simplistic and childish, which may detract from the persuasiveness of their message. For example, they use phrases like \"un petite maison\" and \"une super-ruseine\", which are not typically used in academic or scientific contexts. This can make it difficult to take the speaker's arguments seriously.\n\nFinally, while the speaker mentions their ambition to understand the structure of an enzyme, they do not provide any clear details about how they plan to achieve this goal. Without a more detailed plan or strategy, it is difficult to evaluate the feasibility or likelihood of success of the speaker's project.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some enthusiasm and creativity in their approach, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,325,1759,7890,1970,631,443,7035,29889,435,29915,1794,29871,29906,29945,6063,29892,432,29915,328,487,15237,8121,261,2535,454,365,2412,29889,28079,267,7015,1506,5283,2361,29892,10767,375,29892,432,29915,264,1029,1908,29892,274,29915,342,2320,1387,29889,478,681,282,6223,29920,6787,533,2257,712,7890,28078,11867,29889,853,3440,3435,610,1597,22577,18234,29892,443,1436,19505,610,1597,6283,2353,805,271,4379,29889,4546,29875,29892,1465,611,1243,29892,1444,24853,5695,2535,966,365,2412,29889,11948,2257,3435,443,365,2412,29892,443,8928,29886,29948,455,327,29889,435,29915,1794,23422,29871,29945,3036,346,2993,316,365,2412,29892,634,1597,25642,27829,2131,1959,29872,316,966,297,1365,1524,29889,6101,18402,1506,293,16391,872,2602,29892,1597,2428,29899,582,344,457,2947,7848,6787,568,29889,10793,1509,457,12450,2016,1597,302,4096,457,868,21423,5198,348,9407,3165,475,29892,1750,269,29915,932,1808,425,1939,29916,29892,634,1750,707,1399,11936,575,519,1671,425,15481,371,8474,966,297,1725,1953,29889,6340,707,7877,29948,1860,23428,13873,1750,8556,472,941,16011,18402,8694,29889,2598,3181,654,707,316,7199,9030,425,1047,1004,316,425,9460,316,15093,427,29920,603,707,8288,1487,18165,17239,29889,11948,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,301,29915,1540,427,29920,603,2684,882,1577,1551,8164,6382,4983,1597,427,29920,603,4191,301,29915,375,457,4768,20015,1750,1035,3610,1908,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,23120,1009,15935,363,365,2412,322,1009,13521,304,2274,278,3829,310,385,427,14022,29872,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,365,2412,508,367,1304,304,2274,278,3829,310,385,427,14022,29872,338,10579,3006,17269,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,365,2412,1506,7358,508,367,1304,304,2048,4280,12286,29892,372,338,451,2821,920,445,1104,1078,304,278,6559,310,427,14022,267,29892,607,526,4280,4768,290,1772,21337,411,2702,12286,322,3168,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,2821,10757,470,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,393,365,2412,508,1371,502,2274,427,14022,267,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4086,322,16225,508,367,10579,5466,4695,322,2278,728,29892,607,1122,1439,1461,515,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2643,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,671,12216,2129,763,376,348,22577,18234,29908,322,376,1540,2428,29899,582,344,457,613,607,526,451,12234,1304,297,21567,470,16021,3030,29879,29889,910,508,1207,372,5189,304,2125,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,25798,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,1550,278,25657,26649,1009,3181,654,304,2274,278,3829,310,385,427,14022,29872,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2821,4902,1048,920,896,3814,304,6176,445,7306,29889,13932,263,901,13173,3814,470,13705,29892,372,338,5189,304,14707,278,28326,4127,470,4188,22342,310,2551,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2060,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,23644,3173,29885,322,907,28157,297,1009,2948,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":69491482058,"load_duration":303669,"prompt_eval_count":281,"prompt_eval_duration":25341975000,"eval_count":352,"eval_duration":44148699000}
