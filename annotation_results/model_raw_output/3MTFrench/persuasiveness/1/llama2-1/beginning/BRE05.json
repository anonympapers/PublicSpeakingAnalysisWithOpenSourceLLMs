{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T10:54:26.926887849Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score the speech as a 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker does an effective job of crafting a convincing message by using vivid imagery and personal anecdotes to illustrate their points. The reasoning presented is also rigorous, with the speaker providing specific examples and evidence to support their claims.\n\nThe speaker's use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios helps to engage the audience and draw them into the topic. For example, when describing the experience of being a \"puissant agricole,\" the speaker asks the audience to imagine themselves in the same situation, which helps to create a sense of empathy and shared understanding.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speech could be improved. For instance, at times the speaker's delivery feels a bit disjointed and difficult to follow, which may make it harder for the audience to fully engage with the message. Additionally, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the behavior of bacteria and their potential impact on human behavior, the connection between these topics and the overall message of the speech could be more clearly articulated.\n\nOverall, the speech is well-crafted and effectively conveys the speaker's passion and expertise on the topic. With a few tweaks to the delivery and structure, it has the potential to be even more persuasive and engaging for the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1551,263,9411,20737,5246,553,364,30037,1960,634,534,6916,29892,3503,427,266,17449,29892,373,282,1947,13547,944,818,1487,29140,439,29915,265,25921,610,454,6664,440,276,1597,13618,270,29915,555,347,29889,2581,29758,818,640,29948,1601,16825,364,30037,345,29892,8532,27786,7890,1970,441,519,358,29889,9353,2257,364,30037,345,29892,432,29915,28899,275,443,2653,790,1617,946,374,29899,29886,29948,634,611,715,1647,29889,1605,5903,568,29892,432,29915,1794,2665,29875,443,4880,926,29948,1190,19601,29889,315,29915,342,18916,712,1444,301,29915,1794,18679,29889,951,437,312,5411,427,1750,286,29915,26739,1249,29892,2535,7015,22114,25081,21158,634,872,1999,1709,16568,1173,29889,435,29915,1794,12866,4224,24969,316,8019,443,7006,2298,658,262,1190,425,715,1647,1671,7848,22024,339,1924,29889,315,29915,342,18916,712,432,29915,1794,5246,443,16731,316,7991,29892,443,14857,2653,790,1617,29889,1551,269,29915,342,9577,6079,875,355,29884,29889,8748,427,766,712,29892,427,26534,329,29892,432,29915,1794,623,3780,712,8556,29892,966,2298,22114,29892,373,7905,553,289,627,29948,2722,1750,409,274,496,10978,1465,7814,3038,2540,634,1750,16165,370,277,1249,2535,8556,29889,1720,966,263,16794,29948,553,5016,5365,4769,29889,315,29915,342,29871,4277,29973,8748,980,592,1153,535,4904,712,7015,5016,5365,4769,1750,325,4244,993,427,5016,5365,4769,2535,8556,7446,1564,993,8556,410,6772,914,8474,553,4439,328,583,29892,2123,316,19449,634,7814,610,294,3246,29889,15113,21028,262,1934,10440,29892,980,286,29915,29874,610,12898,316,289,627,29948,2722,2117,1849,316,878,6832,743,7814,20299,4110,29889,315,29915,342,1671,29871,4277,439,29915,265,6303,18916,2535,7991,29889,1551,6303,553,1302,29899,29890,22730,1465,553,1518,4894,2063,20299,882,2122,29889,1551,2906,1249,263,1241,966,14954,1173,1295,818,6628,1314,7199,9030,427,439,7768,316,2560,5697,3246,289,627,29948,2722,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,263,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,491,773,325,3640,6382,708,322,7333,385,687,29881,4769,304,28475,1009,3291,29889,450,24481,9132,338,884,12912,20657,29892,411,278,25657,13138,2702,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,13752,300,936,21846,6911,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,4216,963,964,278,11261,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,20766,278,7271,310,1641,263,376,3746,19505,9221,23249,1699,278,25657,19514,278,20026,304,14034,6053,297,278,1021,6434,29892,607,6911,304,1653,263,4060,310,953,2084,29891,322,7258,8004,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,2777,29892,472,3064,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,23880,263,2586,766,12090,287,322,5189,304,1101,29892,607,1122,1207,372,22622,363,278,20026,304,8072,3033,482,411,278,2643,29889,19814,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,6030,310,289,5761,423,322,1009,7037,10879,373,5199,6030,29892,278,3957,1546,1438,23820,322,278,12463,2643,310,278,12032,1033,367,901,9436,1616,293,7964,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,12032,338,1532,29899,17293,287,322,17583,378,345,952,278,25657,29915,29879,15935,322,17924,895,373,278,11261,29889,2973,263,2846,7780,10327,304,278,28289,322,3829,29892,372,756,278,7037,304,367,1584,901,20408,294,573,322,3033,6751,363,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":75436163912,"load_duration":148922,"prompt_eval_count":382,"prompt_eval_duration":35375394000,"eval_count":310,"eval_duration":40060047000}
