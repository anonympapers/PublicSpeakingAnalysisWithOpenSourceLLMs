The speaker presents some valid points about the potential benefits of using antibodies to treat cancer, but there are several areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While they mention that antibodies can recognize and neutralize foreign substances in the body, they do not provide any scientific studies or research to back up this claim. Additionally, they fail to address potential counterarguments or criticisms of their approach.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's use of technical language and jargon may alienate some of their audience who are not familiar with these terms. A more effective approach would be to use simpler language and provide explanations and examples to help listeners understand the concepts being discussed.\n\nFinally, the speaker could have provided a clearer call to action or a plan for how their proposed approach could be implemented. While they mention that further research is needed, they do not provide any specific steps towards this goal or explain how their approach could be scaled up to make a larger impact.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas, there are several areas where the argument could be strengthened to make it more persuasive and effective.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,897,7814,16283,29892,28194,7890,8992,29920,3008,28230,270,29915,5474,577,647,743,1671,443,23900,29892,966,28374,1020,667,1237,712,301,29915,265,7890,16193,3435,12852,301,30057,305,743,316,13219,2390,347,29892,425,7155,29899,357,2390,347,29892,425,521,381,2007,347,2123,1597,4145,1099,2285,316,5278,364,14856,1318,316,9122,29889,3792,28661,22527,29892,427,2298,868,872,17949,712,274,29915,342,11878,18097,274,29915,342,23778,29892,274,29915,342,11043,270,29915,18949,375,8648,301,29915,29923,16100,29882,1682,8146,29892,2148,275,424,553,1801,1691,1473,7147,1671,301,29915,459,362,29889,10016,1650,818,2257,25698,5000,29892,25810,12866,270,29915,3451,2376,261,1597,11043,452,7631,264,966,269,5903,375,18097,274,29915,342,23778,20498,882,634,1671,18729,29892,373,1671,8356,3667,7608,966,5239,1446,316,24145,5198,348,2131,966,3677,293,272,567,29889,751,392,8556,1047,4467,4439,3076,29892,24145,21423,5198,348,9407,29892,9484,29948,634,17631,417,347,553,5697,3246,6062,29948,21337,29892,966,3677,293,272,567,29892,553,5239,1446,1750,623,2518,993,316,1437,371,312,261,634,452,3534,275,296,5646,454,19872,23428,4600,1597,26722,805,4582,22781,29889,7747,13180,1465,454,3209,868,23900,29892,966,4047,1912,427,5902,344,452,325,609,2331,7848,25456,4191,443,1559,5606,29899,509,4600,29892,634,610,1136,29948,16011,24145,2894,6386,302,29915,264,874,818,2331,1487,289,30057,29948,11062,12794,316,899,4130,29889,319,622,29948,1465,301,29915,6388,6386,29892,7015,5239,1446,452,25238,19047,2331,712,966,4047,1912,427,5902,344,16933,20737,1597,289,7293,1935,2390,347,29892,6701,1354,454,452,1671,336,2414,29890,1803,276,439,29915,348,767,1173,29889,11948,1354,373,6267,3023,484,29892,427,2298,805,1540,270,29915,279,1030,29892,2117,1849,316,260,2491,634,274,29915,342,301,29915,4422,7454,316,6062,29948,21337,304,29916,3783,29892,373,26030,553,5239,1446,2654,449,1849,818,1487,904,26737,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,408,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,7037,23633,310,773,3677,747,397,583,304,7539,23900,29892,541,727,526,3196,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,896,3585,393,3677,747,397,583,508,18720,322,21104,675,9117,5960,2925,297,278,3573,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,16021,11898,470,5925,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,896,4418,304,3211,7037,6795,25699,470,11164,12903,310,1009,2948,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,16905,4086,322,432,1191,265,1122,394,819,403,777,310,1009,20026,1058,526,451,9985,411,1438,4958,29889,319,901,11828,2948,723,367,304,671,13682,4086,322,3867,7309,800,322,6455,304,1371,11621,414,2274,278,22001,1641,15648,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,263,26135,1246,304,3158,470,263,3814,363,920,1009,7972,2948,1033,367,8762,29889,5806,896,3585,393,4340,5925,338,4312,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6576,7113,445,7306,470,5649,920,1009,2948,1033,367,6287,29881,701,304,1207,263,7200,10879,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,29892,727,526,3196,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,304,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,322,11828,29889],"total_duration":71627748500,"load_duration":153041,"prompt_eval_count":388,"prompt_eval_duration":35469333000,"eval_count":286,"eval_duration":36157771000}
