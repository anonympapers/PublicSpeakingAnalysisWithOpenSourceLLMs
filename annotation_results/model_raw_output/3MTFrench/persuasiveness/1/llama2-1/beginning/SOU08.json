The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using technical terms and concepts to support their claims. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and persuasive.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more context and background information on the topic of archaeology and the methods used to date artifacts. While they mention that they use \"méthodes de dataction,\" they do not provide any details on what these methods entail or how they are used to determine the age of artifacts. Providing this context would have helped to establish the speaker's credibility and expertise in the field, making their argument more persuasive.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claim that two different pre-Sturtian populations inhabited the grottes at different times. While they mention that the archiologues have found \"couches de sable qui a enfermé des oeumes et des silèques se taillées,\" they do not provide any specific examples or data to support this claim. Providing more detailed and specific evidence would have made the speaker's argument more persuasive and rigorous.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and persuasive. With some additional context and evidence, the speaker could make a stronger case for their argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,853,3190,29875,1189,434,18475,6967,2298,818,14954,454,784,29885,29892,2257,1750,263,1597,330,8146,818,10920,29889,315,29915,342,443,1437,371,312,361,1750,16374,6896,2736,276,1597,22085,9061,4555,966,285,15322,3435,29057,5059,2406,980,343,263,553,3533,4285,270,29915,812,2406,29889,8748,1671,29871,4277,29892,2331,3008,28230,316,1701,30037,793,29892,1601,18848,707,270,29915,4422,7608,553,8774,386,2631,316,848,428,18934,316,27516,443,19406,479,7175,3476,818,553,16285,3190,29875,1189,3783,16413,1934,270,29915,1540,20244,316,12584,1924,29889,6803,3479,8632,2406,409,10252,296,29892,10252,296,818,443,3256,427,29871,29946,1750,24108,782,6218,868,1766,542,29889,2664,3190,29875,1189,1041,4625,4224,23048,553,26379,316,7175,342,15508,1912,29889,1720,343,427,343,12584,453,424,29892,11797,343,4625,24889,29948,553,274,3222,267,316,269,519,1750,263,29476,12031,553,288,29872,9351,634,553,4047,30000,1912,409,11062,453,2406,29889,1174,966,2852,4749,1934,818,425,301,6648,29892,966,3190,29875,1189,1041,4625,7199,275,712,4239,7006,2701,358,7175,342,15508,1912,316,286,30069,4977,2930,10491,4625,2299,2131,7015,4071,2167,818,553,19462,12694,1237,29889,8748,1671,7199,9030,1671,339,7768,980,343,263,11878,12694,1237,454,3209,29899,29873,29915,1466,1465,7015,4071,2167,29892,980,21668,4048,6390,18097,2257,1874,882,263,11878,13003,29889,360,29915,24430,29892,1444,3060,15773,966,16285,818,1418,29948,29889,2581,452,1236,1314,2331,544,30037,280,369,966,288,29872,9351,29892,9201,16784,13805,29892,1559,966,8774,386,2631,316,848,428,712,432,29915,4422,895,3435,17912,440,743,427,325,17016,4158,562,690,427,18520,29889,838,943,712,23532,29899,9161,29973,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,16905,4958,322,22001,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,3190,3660,3002,322,278,3519,1304,304,2635,24238,29879,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,671,376,12031,386,2631,316,848,428,1699,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,373,825,1438,3519,875,737,470,920,896,526,1304,304,8161,278,5046,310,24238,29879,29889,9133,4821,445,3030,723,505,9213,304,10127,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,322,17924,895,297,278,1746,29892,3907,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,1023,1422,758,29899,855,4227,713,23093,14117,1573,278,4071,698,267,472,1422,3064,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,3190,29875,1189,1041,505,1476,376,29883,3222,267,316,269,519,1750,263,29476,12031,553,288,29872,9351,634,553,4047,30000,1912,409,11062,453,2406,1699,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,2304,445,5995,29889,9133,4821,901,13173,322,2702,10757,723,505,1754,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,20657,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,20408,294,573,29889,2973,777,5684,3030,322,10757,29892,278,25657,1033,1207,263,23505,1206,363,1009,2980,29889],"total_duration":74153930654,"load_duration":165141,"prompt_eval_count":339,"prompt_eval_duration":31329640000,"eval_count":335,"eval_duration":42823733000}
