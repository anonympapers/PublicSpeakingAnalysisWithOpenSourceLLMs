{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T12:54:45.704273609Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker is trying to convince the audience that they are conducting a study on discrimination by sending fake job application emails to people. While the idea of studying discrimination is a valid and important one, the speaker's approach may not be the most effective way to achieve this goal. By using a deceptive tactic such as sending fake emails, the speaker may come across as dishonest or manipulative, which could undermine their credibility and persuasiveness.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker's argument is based on a flawed assumption that people are more likely to choose a job candidate based on their name. However, there are many other factors that can influence hiring decisions, such as qualifications, experience, and fit for the role. The speaker does not provide any evidence or logical reasoning to support their claim that people are more likely to discriminate against certain names.\n3. Logical fallacies: The speaker commits a logical fallacy by assuming that the probability of someone choosing a job candidate based on their name is directly proportional to the number of times they receive an email with a fake application. This assumption is not supported by any evidence and is likely to be false.\n4. Lack of context: The speaker does not provide any context or background information about the study they are conducting, which makes it difficult for the audience to understand the purpose and significance of the study.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's intention to study discrimination is commendable, their approach may not be the most effective or ethical way to achieve this goal. A more rigorous and transparent methodology would be needed to build credibility and persuasiveness.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6298,926,787,712,7890,577,4099,29920,10850,29948,19073,270,29915,348,25479,882,634,712,7890,9982,24135,29920,454,5899,29889,6803,409,9073,29892,7890,27962,1597,22577,2889,10646,1190,8986,29892,610,17488,29892,1190,454,10814,19480,29889,8407,25927,316,13545,16283,29892,7890,2414,13325,7732,611,7545,29892,7732,9667,267,9577,1027,309,7147,1750,452,766,9073,712,610,454,544,1690,290,553,4348,375,29889,3067,23853,347,29892,19748,634,12929,2795,16391,9411,966,7732,26814,25479,882,818,454,16053,29872,1314,29889,478,681,8992,29920,439,29915,30001,18729,29892,980,7890,21668,12866,3060,275,381,2637,7015,7732,4348,375,29889,3872,29883,29892,1444,7890,18593,425,1139,1750,3060,275,24135,29920,7890,1577,3067,23853,347,29892,19748,29892,19601,29899,18202,29889,478,681,3060,275,5582,29920,3479,756,1973,1577,1174,22259,2131,29892,966,7732,611,7545,712,7890,8992,29920,337,24359,3435,285,2993,29889,16932,4625,4370,427,18644,743,610,443,14954,1173,332,29889,7747,14954,1173,332,707,5278,316,7890,16455,643,634,316,1437,18821,261,1354,7890,7175,29888,25138,443,3058,1134,270,29915,513,3640,375,29889,8748,2257,14954,1173,332,707,6079,274,29915,342,19601,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,589,9318,1601,24618,661,2535,443,5900,709,378,24359,1671,443,286,6430,579,424,5025,4170,707,270,29915,264,1365,7598,553,3533,4285,316,611,7545,29889,24804,29899,262,29899,29888,11115,1671,1437,18821,261,1354,12997,8105,882,966,611,7545,1436,2406,904,23853,347,29892,19748,2123,19601,29899,18202,29889,1551,966,521,2925,28374,270,29915,711,841,381,1597,1841,1713,29889,8748,12866,29892,818,301,29915,2987,882,29889,2598,541,29892,7890,454,25179,29948,371,29920,316,7199,275,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,1893,566,631,425,2313,5632,3381,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,338,1811,304,7602,1239,278,20026,393,896,526,7512,292,263,6559,373,2313,5632,3381,491,9348,25713,4982,2280,24609,304,2305,29889,5806,278,2969,310,23382,2313,5632,3381,338,263,2854,322,4100,697,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2948,1122,451,367,278,1556,11828,982,304,6176,445,7306,29889,2648,773,263,316,1547,573,260,17911,1316,408,9348,25713,24609,29892,278,25657,1122,2041,4822,408,270,728,265,342,470,11525,28524,29892,607,1033,563,837,457,1009,6625,4127,322,20408,294,20193,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,2729,373,263,17422,8734,11833,393,2305,526,901,5517,304,6755,263,4982,14020,2729,373,1009,1024,29889,2398,29892,727,526,1784,916,13879,393,508,9949,298,8491,1602,12112,29892,1316,408,4021,8232,29892,7271,29892,322,6216,363,278,6297,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,393,2305,526,901,5517,304,2313,5632,16976,2750,3058,2983,29889,13,29941,29889,4522,936,285,9864,2478,29901,450,25657,25741,263,16667,285,9864,1270,491,10241,393,278,6976,310,4856,23906,263,4982,14020,2729,373,1009,1024,338,4153,29839,304,278,1353,310,3064,896,7150,385,4876,411,263,25713,2280,29889,910,11833,338,451,6969,491,738,10757,322,338,5517,304,367,2089,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,3030,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,3030,470,3239,2472,1048,278,6559,896,526,7512,292,29892,607,3732,372,5189,363,278,20026,304,2274,278,6437,322,26002,310,278,6559,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,16392,304,6559,2313,5632,3381,338,844,355,519,29892,1009,2948,1122,451,367,278,1556,11828,470,11314,936,982,304,6176,445,7306,29889,319,901,12912,20657,322,17772,1158,3002,723,367,4312,304,2048,6625,4127,322,20408,294,20193,29889],"total_duration":81035942819,"load_duration":184430,"prompt_eval_count":349,"prompt_eval_duration":30099591000,"eval_count":404,"eval_duration":50935661000}
