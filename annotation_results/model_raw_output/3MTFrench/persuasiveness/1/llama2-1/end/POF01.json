{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T15:02:11.585127572Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points about the importance of understanding and supporting the children's language development, particularly in the context of multilingual communities. However, the speech could be more convincing with more detailed reasoning and evidence to support the claims made.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that some women and Polynesian people may struggle with the longues de l'Ã©cole, but does not provide any specific examples or data to back up this claim. Additionally, the speech could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the complex social and cultural factors that influence language development in multilingual communities.\n\nOverall, while the speaker has put forward some thoughtful ideas, the speech could be more persuasive with more detailed reasoning and evidence to support the claims made.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1472,1041,316,301,29915,29948,10936,634,23563,1828,14228,20423,4313,8885,5278,7632,29889,1459,17488,29892,425,20368,332,263,260,7741,1318,782,24286,29889,18410,13116,19452,634,1248,1475,7081,20423,7848,427,5189,29948,1998,29899,30001,29899,1730,553,1472,1041,29889,12390,19452,1750,452,25238,19047,302,29915,29891,425,20368,332,316,425,301,1647,29899,29874,30085,29879,7081,1006,29881,568,818,301,29915,29948,10936,782,8115,316,16825,29892,6836,14344,316,425,25407,11076,29892,7275,1318,818,301,29915,29948,10936,818,425,6701,904,15635,634,6079,7015,19452,20423,7175,3666,261,454,286,3610,927,553,1472,1041,29889,1459,1136,29948,16011,29892,6628,1314,454,7199,9030,3440,966,11825,10259,4211,296,10713,21038,1465,425,7632,868,1472,482,553,3030,950,275,743,29889,8407,4880,634,1828,14228,5374,542,12896,19091,29892,8556,263,1241,30001,818,946,381,782,21384,553,5216,7545,1671,712,966,21038,29892,818,425,26558,316,301,29915,29948,10936,1775,824,1808,29892,12852,1465,966,15378,1295,5855,1671,623,29878,9030,818,301,29915,29948,10936,29892,1444,7890,337,1050,5295,29892,611,545,1314,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,8004,322,20382,278,4344,29915,29879,4086,5849,29892,10734,297,278,3030,310,1773,6504,950,23507,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,1033,367,901,17953,3277,411,901,13173,24481,322,10757,304,2304,278,16726,1754,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,777,5866,322,2043,948,18970,2305,1122,21117,411,278,1472,1041,316,301,29915,29948,10936,29892,541,947,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,12032,1033,14169,515,263,901,4948,8362,8004,310,278,4280,5264,322,16375,13879,393,9949,4086,5849,297,1773,6504,950,23507,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,756,1925,6375,777,2714,1319,7014,29892,278,12032,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,411,901,13173,24481,322,10757,304,2304,278,16726,1754,29889],"total_duration":44786376671,"load_duration":152918,"prompt_eval_count":222,"prompt_eval_duration":20986414000,"eval_count":189,"eval_duration":23799249000}
