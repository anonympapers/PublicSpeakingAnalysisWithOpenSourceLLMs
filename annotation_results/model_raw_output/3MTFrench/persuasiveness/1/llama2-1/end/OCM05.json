{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:17:10.071740604Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present a convincing message and demonstrates some rigorous reasoning, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \"supérérons\") and parallelism (\"par exemple, vous savez qu'on m'y a eu...\") to emphasize their points and keep the audience engaged. They also provide concrete examples from popular culture, such as Batman, to illustrate their argument that superheroes are not just fictional characters but reflective of deeper societal trends.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to the speaker's argument. For instance, the definition of \"supérérons\" is not clearly defined, and it is not entirely clear what the speaker means by \"being a supérieur.\" Additionally, the speaker's argument relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and personal opinions, which may not be persuasive to all listeners.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a thought-provoking argument, there are areas where they could have provided more nuanced and evidence-based reasoning to make their case even stronger.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,9947,427,1999,5000,2025,2249,1387,29889,1720,263,2002,6416,29884,553,8595,782,419,1199,1671,7848,8265,29876,375,1465,301,29915,442,3503,9982,555,1759,29892,274,29915,342,521,542,2353,29889,11948,17124,305,882,1601,509,261,439,29915,265,263,9411,782,6299,316,8556,443,13159,14508,7175,3666,29948,29889,853,15001,482,1750,8556,263,2298,1766,17851,439,29915,348,14857,29889,1281,578,361,29892,427,1436,29892,2123,1661,29889,2664,13159,1064,1064,787,8556,364,465,13365,296,29889,1720,766,712,21907,12784,263,3107,21522,8556,818,9551,316,425,19513,29892,818,9551,316,1750,8556,1047,4467,325,336,2073,29892,2257,1750,8556,11482,2344,8556,1841,348,275,29889,1459,17488,29892,7890,4078,29920,439,29915,265,286,29915,29891,263,11878,316,26943,5278,19951,782,422,293,1281,7209,904,1484,29892,29871,29896,29941,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,18554,818,29871,29929,274,1237,316,301,29915,442,425,2058,29892,5278,904,12324,29872,29889,951,27799,492,1139,1465,425,9257,634,425,19513,707,782,29899,6144,30001,868,652,1765,11537,29889,315,29915,342,21907,12784,1750,16731,1671,8556,634,11797,4625,1597,2058,7175,2818,29948,661,371,1465,24145,19513,634,1465,24145,12471,17239,29889,838,943,29892,2123,12675,29920,454,29871,30106,309,29889,8748,7890,1147,15749,966,13159,1064,1064,787,3435,760,449,29889,478,681,992,4099,29920,12579,1171,29892,274,29915,342,443,13159,14508,1671,8714,980,302,29915,29874,2331,316,2428,19397,29889,1459,346,712,1436,6311,29892,274,29915,342,29871,4277,7848,443,13159,14508,29889,838,943,29892,818,11482,1300,270,29915,5474,19601,29899,18202,1597,13159,22673,29892,274,29915,342,2535,5278,8774,386,356,712,1444,325,1759,316,15470,29889,4942,29889,2726,29883,1690,8596,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,263,17953,3277,2643,322,9004,1078,777,12912,20657,24481,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,1576,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,12587,1064,1064,787,1159,322,8943,1608,4852,862,17488,29892,7890,4078,29920,439,29915,265,286,29915,29891,263,11878,856,1159,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,3013,278,20026,17785,29889,2688,884,3867,18387,6455,515,5972,9257,29892,1316,408,12579,1171,29892,304,28475,1009,2980,393,2428,29882,1489,267,526,451,925,26797,1848,4890,541,9432,573,310,25871,5374,26310,534,1975,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,27028,304,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,5023,310,376,12587,1064,1064,787,29908,338,451,9436,3342,29892,322,372,338,451,9186,2821,825,278,25657,2794,491,376,915,292,263,13159,14508,1213,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,26971,29892,607,1122,451,367,20408,294,573,304,599,11621,414,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2714,29899,16123,17223,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,505,4944,901,4948,8362,322,10757,29899,6707,24481,304,1207,1009,1206,1584,23505,29889],"total_duration":68190786161,"load_duration":221849,"prompt_eval_count":343,"prompt_eval_duration":31904474000,"eval_count":276,"eval_duration":36285613000}
