The speaker provides some interesting insights into the use of simulation in various fields, including animation and industry. However, the speech lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, and the arguments could be more robustly supported with evidence and logical reasoning.\n\nThe speaker's use of analogies and metaphors, such as comparing the simulation to a \"maladroit\" mixture of water and air, is an effective way to explain complex concepts. However, these analogies are not always clear or consistent throughout the speech, which can make it difficult for the listener to fully understand the speaker's point.\n\nThe speaker also makes some general statements about the importance of simulation in various fields without providing specific examples or evidence to support these claims. For example, the speaker mentions that the software they are developing will be used for \"des cas industriels,\" but does not provide any details about what these cases might entail or how the software will be used in practice.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in their analysis of simulation, there is room for improvement in terms of depth and rigor in their arguments.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1465,454,2706,425,997,345,1671,11387,443,286,3610,927,270,29915,14531,634,270,29915,1466,4191,5644,262,316,5697,1169,18167,316,5697,3246,289,7545,1750,409,1437,6689,634,1006,351,19047,966,1597,2535,966,10890,29889,838,943,2284,267,1465,301,29915,18962,29892,373,301,29915,4422,895,1671,7697,276,2181,2487,1821,1998,27751,553,904,13147,4110,9577,1437,689,743,29889,341,14056,553,325,351,336,30085,5711,778,1539,29873,424,443,4439,966,339,583,868,22500,1883,29892,2123,443,904,12324,29872,260,11445,4479,27710,482,424,425,8441,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,454,5900,709,316,17402,712,1444,13942,29877,4798,16933,28332,29948,818,1020,1524,553,3209,21136,4999,29889,1720,707,12866,4100,270,29915,28619,1597,12450,9233,25947,15340,316,425,22259,2131,29889,11948,3440,325,1064,3709,425,4021,2131,29892,425,15426,316,17402,1577,6803,18729,29892,1444,1236,1314,443,5246,818,1236,457,818,553,6896,19718,5844,2249,19669,1465,553,3209,1027,2701,4191,425,1083,265,357,270,29915,1540,8227,280,29892,2123,553,1518,4894,2063,427,10212,20141,1671,4224,14274,535,10709,4191,454,1437,571,17239,270,29915,1540,25160,29889,838,943,13180,325,359,410,305,13116,11757,2925,427,12796,316,2778,29892,2123,26814,410,14153,882,1804,29948,19398,443,2706,6635,579,1336,354,29892,7890,282,1947,29920,29899,23088,8164,29899,5474,818,19601,634,443,592,29884,2058,6722,980,343,263,443,592,29884,2058,6722,980,343,263,443,7006,316,2298,316,367,20503,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,671,310,17402,297,5164,4235,29892,3704,9612,322,13661,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,10809,322,4948,749,297,967,7418,29892,322,278,6273,1033,367,901,16424,368,6969,411,10757,322,16667,24481,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,15690,583,322,1539,12451,943,29892,1316,408,17420,278,17402,304,263,376,5156,328,15164,29908,29544,310,4094,322,4799,29892,338,385,11828,982,304,5649,4280,22001,29889,2398,29892,1438,15690,583,526,451,2337,2821,470,13747,10106,278,12032,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,1298,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,3732,777,2498,9506,1048,278,13500,310,17402,297,5164,4235,1728,13138,2702,6455,470,10757,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,7047,896,526,14338,674,367,1304,363,376,2783,3209,21136,1379,1699,541,947,451,3867,738,4902,1048,825,1438,4251,1795,875,737,470,920,278,7047,674,367,1304,297,6944,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,11640,297,1009,7418,310,17402,29892,727,338,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,10809,322,12912,272,297,1009,6273,29889],"total_duration":60131638916,"load_duration":149768,"prompt_eval_count":297,"prompt_eval_duration":27297859000,"eval_count":261,"eval_duration":32833131000}
