{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:12:06.962175998Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness. The speaker presents a clear and convincing message, providing logical reasoning and citing credible sources to support their claims. They effectively use rhetorical devices such as repetition and metaphors to emphasize their points and engage the audience.\n\nThe speaker demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic, showcasing a comprehensive knowledge of the field of bio-resources and their potential applications. They provide specific examples and references to support their claims, demonstrating their credibility and expertise. The use of technical terms and jargon is appropriate and does not overwhelm the audience, instead adding to the speaker's authority on the subject.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speech could be improved. At times, the speaker's delivery feels a bit dry and lacking in passion, which may reduce the emotional impact of their message. Additionally, some of the transitions between ideas feel abrupt, which can make the flow of the speech slightly disjointed.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a well-crafted and convincing argument, but could benefit from adding more enthusiasm and smoothness to their delivery.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,3500,631,712,301,29915,265,1671,8356,623,492,7808,1190,7814,16435,277,19199,634,6079,269,30095,29878,409,3911,29899,455,25810,27666,316,26722,634,3928,519,29889,319,4951,316,269,29915,3470,4014,381,553,1391,1169,29892,282,1893,307,27801,1671,10628,7869,7814,11549,277,10270,29892,1444,19760,23532,1601,8681,12232,29892,263,26231,29889,8748,4191,8556,301,29915,485,787,18679,5646,818,301,29915,28661,29892,301,29915,279,391,5340,316,301,29915,3470,6698,261,8164,8556,285,2905,381,16653,434,316,17799,29899,13237,1750,2414,453,296,1597,6815,6894,2131,316,6062,29948,21337,2441,267,1190,966,339,4999,454,20674,2488,29892,28602,2488,712,1444,26099,29892,8164,17631,2376,261,12563,872,9484,1926,2131,1671,7877,3717,261,316,10984,2993,1775,4894,2993,29889,9353,454,25915,316,611,266,17449,29892,1601,1203,361,707,316,13942,29877,2496,553,6062,29948,21337,26957,29892,23459,743,2123,1721,375,316,425,5469,29892,14344,29899,455,28644,787,316,1506,293,316,2967,1671,7877,3717,261,818,425,10098,553,3038,2540,899,7147,3669,2701,634,24233,3794,634,553,301,30000,29881,943,330,4211,743,1750,724,609,2298,6366,3302,634,1750,1136,290,358,11387,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,1174,6896,398,29948,29892,4883,17124,6609,1136,2488,818,4327,261,425,10466,24159,270,29915,29882,631,634,270,29915,585,18997,29915,15669,29892,427,26814,13911,333,819,316,4239,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,17953,3277,2643,29892,13138,16667,24481,322,7537,292,6625,1821,8974,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2688,17583,671,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,1539,12451,943,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,3033,482,278,20026,29889,13,13,1576,25657,9004,1078,263,17826,8004,310,278,11261,29892,1510,29883,5832,263,15171,6270,7134,310,278,1746,310,17799,29899,13237,322,1009,7037,8324,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,322,9282,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,9004,1218,1009,6625,4127,322,17924,895,29889,450,671,310,16905,4958,322,432,1191,265,338,8210,322,947,451,975,1332,16422,278,20026,29892,2012,4417,304,278,25657,29915,29879,14329,373,278,4967,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28289,23880,263,2586,15589,322,10225,292,297,15935,29892,607,1122,10032,278,23023,1848,10879,310,1009,2643,29889,19814,29892,777,310,278,1301,2187,1546,7014,4459,633,6685,29892,607,508,1207,278,4972,310,278,12032,10029,766,12090,287,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,17293,287,322,17953,3277,2980,29892,541,1033,14169,515,4417,901,23644,3173,29885,322,10597,2264,304,1009,28289,29889],"total_duration":58645263619,"load_duration":236924,"prompt_eval_count":278,"prompt_eval_duration":25155500000,"eval_count":269,"eval_duration":33489069000}
