{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:00:12.643568788Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a convincing message and present rigorous reasoning. The speaker provides a clear and structured argument, starting with the problem of the North region's dependence on a few large-scale producers and the potential consequences of this situation. They then go on to discuss the issues of growth and the market, using a combination of personal anecdotes and analytical keys to synthesize their understanding of these markets.\n\nThe speaker also acknowledges the tensions and inqui√©tudes between different stakeholders and highlights the importance of maintaining good relations with farmers and the need for a fair remuneration for their work. They conclude by questioning whether the current state of agriculture is sustainable, given the amount of money spent on it.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a well-reasoned and persuasive argument, using a combination of personal experience and analytical keys to support their claims. However, there is room for improvement in terms of presenting more concrete evidence and data to support their arguments.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,425,14326,6218,316,26379,2362,1144,316,5802,10918,398,631,29892,1671,4325,9996,261,7015,3234,11620,818,6267,760,2386,533,23837,1387,29889,2664,23440,4637,1750,337,2972,296,425,1841,1054,371,29892,966,425,1960,29892,966,534,275,634,966,22609,1465,966,269,496,1691,712,8556,3657,2650,29920,29889,8407,6282,316,425,266,420,29892,8556,1029,787,2313,329,29948,553,25698,2249,19669,316,425,8182,9948,634,868,8575,29948,29889,435,29915,1794,13659,29948,2535,19601,553,270,466,13116,634,553,270,466,13116,316,1295,270,29915,296,2267,819,316,1841,20752,634,270,29915,24209,344,553,25698,2249,19669,316,7015,18342,787,610,19449,1750,966,4079,29889,2581,26099,427,24407,19951,316,266,17449,634,1444,14710,1893,895,553,25766,316,7199,29948,29882,2673,316,7015,8575,743,29889,2664,260,5580,634,966,297,6578,1893,8192,2637,966,12694,1237,611,453,787,29889,2726,3291,316,21448,439,29915,309,21668,11469,427,17949,18097,373,5246,868,24346,29889,6803,17161,261,553,5302,885,22702,29892,1671,712,301,29915,23641,29892,1671,712,6267,1083,348,261,362,7890,22847,443,1841,295,18848,634,1671,712,5278,23837,347,427,13184,1034,690,1112,311,3479,1841,1379,29889,838,943,2535,5646,29871,4277,29892,707,29899,346,712,24145,18032,545,707,6079,1577,1174,5646,3209,29892,301,29915,23641,712,8556,17631,575,787,18475,1590,25931,454,18032,545,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,8128,263,2821,322,2281,2955,2980,29892,6257,411,278,1108,310,278,4644,5120,29915,29879,26307,373,263,2846,2919,29899,7052,1391,22543,322,278,7037,27721,310,445,6434,29889,2688,769,748,373,304,5353,278,5626,310,14321,322,278,9999,29892,773,263,10296,310,7333,385,687,29881,4769,322,16114,936,6611,304,14710,267,675,1009,8004,310,1438,2791,1691,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,24084,2710,278,260,5580,322,297,6578,1893,8192,1546,1422,380,1296,8948,414,322,12141,29879,278,13500,310,7344,292,1781,5302,411,2215,13269,322,278,817,363,263,6534,1083,348,261,362,363,1009,664,29889,2688,17668,491,1139,292,3692,278,1857,2106,310,18032,545,338,15075,475,519,29892,2183,278,5253,310,6909,10398,373,372,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,23147,287,322,20408,294,573,2980,29892,773,263,10296,310,7333,7271,322,16114,936,6611,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,338,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,2198,292,901,18387,10757,322,848,304,2304,1009,6273,29889],"total_duration":55382200320,"load_duration":236050,"prompt_eval_count":276,"prompt_eval_duration":24738650000,"eval_count":244,"eval_duration":30642307000}
