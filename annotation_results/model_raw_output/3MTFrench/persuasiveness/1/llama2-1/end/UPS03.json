{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T14:33:13.646873232Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some interesting and innovative ideas for using seismic waves to study the movement of objects, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker mentions that they have developed a method to \"study the movement of objects using seismic waves.\" However, they do not provide any details on how this method works or what specific aspects of object movement it can detect. This lack of clarity makes it difficult for the listener to fully understand the speaker's claims.\n\nSecondly, the speaker uses some technical terms without providing adequate explanations or definitions. For example, they mention \"ondes seismiques\" and \"propagation de l'onde,\" but do not explain what these terms mean or how they relate to the movement of objects. This lack of clarity can make it difficult for listeners to follow the speaker's arguments.\n\nFinally, the speaker makes some broad generalizations about the potential applications of their method without providing any specific examples or case studies. While it is encouraging to hear that their method could be applied to a wide range of fields, including the study of Mongol movements and the resistance of barages hydroelectric, these claims are difficult to evaluate without more detailed information.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some intriguing ideas, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the explanations more clear. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects this mixed performance.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,7890,26427,29920,269,30095,276,358,3503,3440,2947,29899,29873,29899,309,534,8885,1597,2280,1465,443,2432,9874,29338,316,13547,25902,1577,382,29882,6079,966,8774,386,2631,712,1444,13942,29877,4798,872,13219,30057,412,610,5444,17334,818,301,29915,1893,1151,553,7019,1608,267,29889,11044,388,787,316,7199,9030,29892,425,4303,10500,316,301,29915,13469,316,18402,610,301,29915,24516,359,291,29892,872,610,2016,818,425,4303,10500,270,29915,898,267,409,1608,3783,610,443,7019,6386,29889,12390,373,2783,409,1608,3783,409,13089,296,18158,1465,425,5061,276,14864,553,658,275,1027,309,7147,818,425,13089,362,316,301,29915,13469,316,18402,1465,301,29915,14531,29889,1174,4951,29892,425,2123,301,29915,24516,359,291,409,23585,443,282,627,29872,443,5898,29899,3034,262,29892,454,7019,6386,3911,29892,443,282,627,29872,1597,8441,2123,443,21592,2073,29889,2664,7019,1608,267,452,3435,439,29915,348,17488,29892,3503,23520,29871,4277,2947,5695,1465,301,29915,1893,1151,868,25924,553,21952,3775,29899,29888,6349,29892,2123,10440,316,425,6896,21558,553,2594,1179,17546,15436,2200,29889,8748,1750,872,277,29892,8164,29899,5474,439,29915,348,8694,29892,7814,17124,6609,724,609,4191,2257,977,542,271,1671,454,9200,898,267,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,322,24233,1230,7014,363,773,409,1608,293,20037,304,6559,278,10298,310,3618,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,505,8906,263,1158,304,376,18082,29891,278,10298,310,3618,773,409,1608,293,20037,1213,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,445,1158,1736,470,825,2702,21420,310,1203,10298,372,508,6459,29889,910,10225,310,7542,537,3732,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,8072,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,3913,777,16905,4958,1728,13138,19967,339,403,7309,800,470,15848,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,376,898,267,409,1608,3783,29908,322,376,7728,351,362,316,301,29915,13469,1699,541,437,451,5649,825,1438,4958,2099,470,920,896,29279,304,278,10298,310,3618,29889,910,10225,310,7542,537,508,1207,372,5189,363,11621,414,304,1101,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,3732,777,7300,2498,17063,1048,278,7037,8324,310,1009,1158,1728,13138,738,2702,6455,470,1206,11898,29889,5806,372,338,18443,292,304,8293,393,1009,1158,1033,367,7436,304,263,9377,3464,310,4235,29892,3704,278,6559,310,21952,324,24147,322,278,17711,310,2594,1179,17546,15436,2200,29892,1438,16726,526,5189,304,14707,1728,901,13173,2472,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,11158,5526,292,7014,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,7309,800,901,2821,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,445,12849,4180,29889],"total_duration":65206407091,"load_duration":221422,"prompt_eval_count":253,"prompt_eval_duration":22623830000,"eval_count":343,"eval_duration":42581804000}
