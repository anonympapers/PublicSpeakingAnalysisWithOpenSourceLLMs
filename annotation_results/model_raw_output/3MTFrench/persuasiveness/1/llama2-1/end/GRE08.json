{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T07:20:02.821534195Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a persuasive message and present a rigorous argument. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of clarity and coherence: The speaker's arguments are not well-structured or easy to follow. The transcript is filled with awkward phrasing, repetition, and unclear connections between ideas. This makes it difficult for the listener to understand the speaker's main point or evaluate their argument.\n2. Use of filler words and repetitive language: The speaker uses a lot of filler words such as \"et\" and \"moi\" which can make the speech feel unpolished and lacking in substance. Additionally, they repeat certain phrases multiple times throughout the speech, which can come across as unnecessary and distract from the main message.\n3. Limited evidence or examples: The speaker does not provide any concrete evidence or examples to support their claims, making it difficult for the listener to evaluate the validity of their argument.\n4. Lack of a clear call to action: The speaker does not provide a clear call to action or solution to the problem they are addressing, which can make the speech feel incomplete and lacking in impact.\n\nOverall, while the speaker may be passionate about their topic, their message is not well-crafted or persuasive due to the issues mentioned above.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,7890,282,6223,29920,11113,276,301,29915,2611,5008,2069,4379,634,9484,261,553,966,787,2535,425,7101,29889,8748,12866,11113,276,301,29915,2611,5008,2069,4379,29889,1551,8164,12468,307,4630,2257,1374,1690,290,8146,29899,27048,868,10636,3893,434,270,29915,8284,1295,19601,29892,2535,966,1374,265,19503,409,1314,634,923,1314,1750,3435,5646,16530,20564,2923,293,5475,818,11504,265,2265,634,1190,301,29915,29948,13295,443,470,7289,6701,17924,263,2002,868,4439,818,1597,5112,649,774,29889,2581,7890,1539,29879,270,29915,8284,1295,782,1437,7241,270,29915,324,9073,29889,8748,12866,1671,2331,454,619,264,818,2257,25698,5000,553,301,29915,15693,17925,2535,454,10636,3893,434,29892,373,8164,29202,9073,16794,818,443,470,371,29888,3409,2488,1750,1671,336,8556,263,1241,10741,767,29038,29889,1551,263,16474,553,4047,2063,2637,18402,3184,1671,7697,276,454,2313,2470,2298,285,7459,29889,1551,427,5246,269,29915,309,343,11172,301,29915,442,293,2785,610,17488,29889,8748,6079,316,425,6701,26722,29892,966,21136,1379,325,609,13612,5561,818,6267,10283,293,20060,553,260,5326,577,627,10270,1750,325,609,452,592,6836,342,4427,7608,425,6062,4582,1297,29889,11948,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,265,452,872,277,2331,325,336,2073,3440,11797,325,609,946,381,966,260,5326,577,627,10270,29889,8748,12866,1601,541,868,1083,403,29920,29892,274,29915,342,1437,18821,29948,3440,966,260,5326,577,627,10270,325,609,6003,381,410,6772,914,454,10283,293,1166,29892,443,7006,818,425,26722,4555,373,734,18371,895,1750,8556,263,1241,29874,818,11504,265,2265,443,521,30057,1173,332,29892,443,521,30057,1173,332,29892,443,521,30057,1173,332,29892,443,521,30057,1173,332,634,443,3184,521,30057,1173,332,29889,11948,4191,7890,992,4099,29920,29892,1444,452,343,18331,8714,10440,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,20408,294,573,2643,322,2198,263,12912,20657,2980,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,7542,537,322,16165,261,663,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,6273,526,451,1532,29899,4984,2955,470,4780,304,1101,29889,450,1301,924,338,10423,411,13689,1328,12216,5832,29892,21159,654,29892,322,20871,12368,1546,7014,29889,910,3732,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,2274,278,25657,29915,29879,1667,1298,470,14707,1009,2980,29889,13,29906,29889,4803,310,5445,261,3838,322,21159,3321,4086,29901,450,25657,3913,263,3287,310,5445,261,3838,1316,408,376,300,29908,322,376,4346,29875,29908,607,508,1207,278,12032,4459,443,3733,3276,322,10225,292,297,5960,749,29889,19814,29892,896,12312,3058,12216,2129,2999,3064,10106,278,12032,29892,607,508,2041,4822,408,19039,322,1320,1461,515,278,1667,2643,29889,13,29941,29889,28873,10757,470,6455,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,3907,372,5189,363,278,13254,304,14707,278,2854,537,310,1009,2980,29889,13,29946,29889,365,547,310,263,2821,1246,304,3158,29901,450,25657,947,451,3867,263,2821,1246,304,3158,470,1650,304,278,1108,896,526,3211,292,29892,607,508,1207,278,12032,4459,28907,322,10225,292,297,10879,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1122,367,15935,403,1048,1009,11261,29892,1009,2643,338,451,1532,29899,17293,287,470,20408,294,573,2861,304,278,5626,5276,2038,29889],"total_duration":74852360722,"load_duration":234180,"prompt_eval_count":369,"prompt_eval_duration":33915270000,"eval_count":310,"eval_duration":40936302000}
