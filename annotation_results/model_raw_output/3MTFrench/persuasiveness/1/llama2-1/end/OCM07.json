{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:10:05.158151389Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using simple language that is easy to understand. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that the \"champignon gentil\" can defeat the \"méchant\" by disabling its toxins and stealing its food is not fully explained. It would have been helpful to provide more details on how this process works and why it is effective. Additionally, the speaker's assertion that the \"champignon gentil\" has a better understanding of the \"codgenétique\" than the \"méchant\" is not supported by any evidence or examples.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's argument that the \"champignon gentil\" is more effective against the \"méchant\" because it can choose the best candidates among them is not fully developed. It would have been helpful to provide more information on how the speaker determines which champignons are the most effective and why their approach is superior to other methods.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects this mid-range performance.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,269,29915,264,282,647,424,8774,13775,29889,6101,454,7006,454,767,479,553,1513,4110,29892,301,29915,3451,30037,4630,316,1391,533,3999,304,29916,1475,29892,3911,1700,261,872,302,473,768,545,1671,712,3911,452,2653,5582,2298,409,13942,29877,2496,29889,438,29884,10440,29892,5646,818,301,29915,3470,7768,29889,11948,1671,712,454,18480,29582,8116,309,1437,695,264,1173,269,29915,7614,532,453,631,12866,782,11387,1597,316,3999,564,4467,29889,1720,2947,11469,3008,28230,270,29915,11236,743,553,20542,1936,14549,5908,316,1487,11033,29940,1671,269,29915,524,300,7608,3058,267,6062,29948,21337,270,29915,14975,1912,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,6701,3911,3119,14785,1465,18402,1597,316,3999,3038,2540,29892,454,15234,1885,19971,29892,13704,1750,14924,818,9411,966,29871,30037,5888,9364,1934,270,29915,5474,19449,1750,454,3435,29889,365,1481,29892,2535,7015,13830,16273,29892,6722,3435,302,29915,6430,2406,29892,634,7890,29892,2535,325,359,26809,1766,1617,2123,10767,29884,29889,8748,28194,980,6136,1487,15234,29892,432,29915,264,1727,22715,966,20542,270,29915,3035,29940,5039,2406,966,1804,2993,14864,966,28374,26742,2445,583,966,2298,6366,3302,29889,8748,274,29915,342,6079,5278,15378,545,17043,9948,316,9411,7015,26742,2445,583,634,7015,1804,2993,316,15499,1750,2947,592,19172,276,316,3060,275,381,25763,966,18480,29582,8116,2719,634,15378,1295,7105,1446,29889,2726,18480,647,787,8116,2719,9577,6366,3302,8474,966,8774,305,1934,634,7209,1801,17856,3700,1190,966,904,3944,858,19503,553,11179,567,316,10767,375,29889,6803,7848,269,30095,29878,29892,439,29915,265,2653,5582,5646,269,29915,264,3221,1472,27761,286,4600,7209,9703,443,10814,3036,346,585,316,282,30057,1173,782,868,1700,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2560,4086,393,338,4780,304,2274,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,278,376,305,1160,29582,8116,309,29908,508,20653,278,376,12031,13775,29908,491,766,17961,967,304,29916,1144,322,1886,12818,967,9687,338,451,8072,10824,29889,739,723,505,1063,8444,304,3867,901,4902,373,920,445,1889,1736,322,2020,372,338,11828,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,278,376,305,1160,29582,8116,309,29908,756,263,2253,8004,310,278,376,19284,1885,19971,29908,1135,278,376,12031,13775,29908,338,451,6969,491,738,10757,470,6455,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,376,305,1160,29582,8116,309,29908,338,901,11828,2750,278,376,12031,13775,29908,1363,372,508,6755,278,1900,21669,4249,963,338,451,8072,8906,29889,739,723,505,1063,8444,304,3867,901,2472,373,920,278,25657,3683,1475,607,18480,647,787,526,278,1556,11828,322,2020,1009,2948,338,11558,304,916,3519,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,445,7145,29899,3881,4180,29889],"total_duration":69675352489,"load_duration":237061,"prompt_eval_count":342,"prompt_eval_duration":31052880000,"eval_count":305,"eval_duration":38621670000}
