{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T14:03:07.923320278Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. While the speaker is trying to present an innovative idea, their reasoning and arguments are not particularly rigorous or convincing. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: The speaker mentions that they are not a doctor, but they propose an unconventional method for harnessing geothermal energy without providing any scientific evidence to support their claims. This lack of evidence makes it difficult to take their proposal seriously.\n2. Unclear logic: The speaker's argument seems to be based on a series of assumptions and hypothetical scenarios, but the connections between these elements are not clearly explained. For example, how does one go from the idea that the pieton d'Ã©nergie is full of hot water to the conclusion that it can be used for geothermal energy production?\n3. Unrealistic expectations: The speaker seems to be proposing a utopian solution to the problem of energy production, but they do not provide any practical details or timelines for how this could be achieved. This lack of realism reduces the persuasiveness of their argument.\n4. Poor communication skills: The speaker's use of French and English mixes and awkward phrasing can make it difficult to follow their argument at times. This can make their proposal less persuasive to an international audience.\n\nOverall, while the speaker is trying to propose a novel solution to the energy crisis, their lack of rigor and unclear logic reduce the persuasiveness of their speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,452,26099,2331,25974,262,29892,12866,1444,452,26099,2331,966,577,647,743,29892,3503,818,4048,6390,1354,373,707,427,2298,6366,815,29889,11948,7594,8164,29899,5474,409,534,743,272,1190,443,1700,260,29915,264,707,427,16794,29948,454,282,2035,265,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,1577,997,521,744,332,707,10019,680,29885,358,29892,274,29915,342,28185,9373,454,10329,566,270,29915,28619,10273,533,29892,425,10505,720,837,347,316,1487,17887,2245,29889,11948,29871,4277,260,29915,13989,866,29892,4191,373,269,29915,262,3901,634,818,269,29915,29891,274,496,1572,993,454,9122,29889,315,29915,342,18916,5646,301,29915,574,434,1509,316,425,18768,8691,316,611,17949,29889,2581,325,1759,2779,2853,1597,24618,4437,29892,454,1472,316,3999,285,1461,1973,29892,427,16623,424,27962,443,1671,427,24618,1377,1465,454,899,1671,4048,6390,1354,553,1652,3246,521,30069,1372,2123,553,10505,720,837,1041,343,274,496,296,29889,1174,270,29915,14559,1840,267,29892,432,29915,9297,347,316,4048,6390,1354,966,285,1461,1973,868,282,2035,265,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,316,1040,12937,610,427,22259,2131,29892,443,325,4350,28710,316,18643,4371,27799,492,270,29915,14531,521,585,311,29892,782,2757,270,29915,1540,6898,895,1841,1066,573,553,2114,1973,297,1454,351,2406,29892,1671,9073,427,1601,357,5278,447,1082,29892,427,7101,1671,1391,533,316,301,29915,29948,781,2200,2131,29889,478,681,301,29915,1351,29920,7199,275,29892,4883,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,1444,452,325,1759,269,30095,276,358,2331,11817,261,301,29915,14531,521,585,311,29892,3503,432,29915,1794,7732,6063,1671,3686,2747,316,425,734,6013,1318,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,5806,278,25657,338,1811,304,2198,385,24233,1230,2969,29892,1009,24481,322,6273,526,451,10734,12912,20657,470,17953,3277,29889,2266,526,777,9590,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,26649,393,896,526,451,263,11619,29892,541,896,16193,385,443,535,794,1848,1158,363,4023,2264,292,1737,720,837,284,5864,1728,13138,738,16021,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,10225,310,10757,3732,372,5189,304,2125,1009,24963,25798,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,5900,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,2444,304,367,2729,373,263,3652,310,20813,322,13752,300,936,21846,29892,541,278,12368,1546,1438,3161,526,451,9436,10824,29889,1152,1342,29892,920,947,697,748,515,278,2969,393,278,282,2035,265,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,338,2989,310,7375,4094,304,278,15997,393,372,508,367,1304,363,1737,720,837,284,5864,5802,29973,13,29941,29889,853,6370,4695,2149,800,29901,450,25657,2444,304,367,9551,292,263,318,3332,713,1650,304,278,1108,310,5864,5802,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,15031,4902,470,5335,24210,363,920,445,1033,367,14363,29889,910,10225,310,1855,1608,26830,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2980,29889,13,29946,29889,3929,272,12084,25078,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,671,310,5176,322,4223,6837,267,322,13689,1328,12216,5832,508,1207,372,5189,304,1101,1009,2980,472,3064,29889,910,508,1207,1009,24963,3109,20408,294,573,304,385,6121,20026,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,338,1811,304,16193,263,9554,1650,304,278,5864,24161,29892,1009,10225,310,12912,272,322,20871,5900,10032,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,12032,29889],"total_duration":76470610769,"load_duration":268698,"prompt_eval_count":333,"prompt_eval_duration":31565251000,"eval_count":347,"eval_duration":44904546000}
