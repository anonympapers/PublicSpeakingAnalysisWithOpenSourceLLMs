The speaker presents a novel idea for a liquid ionic material that could potentially be used to create a new type of battery, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker makes a valid point about the limitations of traditional batteries and the need for a more efficient and sustainable solution. However, they do not provide any concrete evidence or data to support their claim that liquid ionic materials are the solution. They simply state that it is \"en des petites boules\" without providing any details on how these particles work or why they are more effective than traditional battery materials.\n\nSecondly, the speaker mentions that the material they are proposing could be used to create a new type of battery, but they do not explain how this would work or what the advantages of such a battery would be. They simply state that it would be \"un peu comme carrécer boubah à l'aéroport d'Orléans,\" without providing any context or explanation for why this would be significant.\n\nFinally, the speaker mentions that they have found a way to prevent the particles from sticking together by coating them with a compatible layer, but they do not provide any details on how this works or what types of materials could be used for this purpose.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents an interesting idea for a new type of battery, they do not provide enough information or evidence to fully convince the listener of its potential effectiveness. A more rigorous and detailed explanation of the material and its properties would be needed to persuade the audience of its merits.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,2684,882,2257,712,1444,2453,1314,16035,1524,29889,8748,12866,3060,275,277,316,3667,7608,443,5535,1750,15617,680,818,5694,19113,3181,6759,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,29871,4277,269,29915,932,1808,443,15617,680,16346,1387,29889,315,29915,342,427,553,5697,3246,16380,793,782,19120,14255,1798,371,1190,301,29915,3027,29889,1720,18062,443,16825,25698,5000,29889,2664,1936,2540,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,265,14931,4191,553,5697,3246,7019,1860,29889,1720,269,29915,1131,533,29889,8748,364,14056,427,6958,29892,980,707,427,2600,898,29889,853,7006,4191,1559,5606,2265,16380,28758,818,301,29915,279,17834,270,29915,29949,2096,347,29889,438,29884,1759,29889,8748,18916,29892,454,8323,332,452,18165,484,2298,29889,6803,10019,1524,29871,4277,29892,373,8164,1874,261,425,7101,270,29915,1540,385,459,442,293,1297,29889,435,29915,1794,24889,29948,439,29915,265,8164,966,427,29878,30069,546,2535,1597,3581,1173,3279,9988,625,15878,2535,966,15617,680,29871,3688,1912,29889,6803,10019,1524,439,29915,309,707,16530,20564,427,6958,29889,853,7006,4191,443,1190,425,15373,782,289,1107,29899,6661,29892,1444,26099,427,29878,30069,29886,1318,610,1597,3581,1173,634,26744,316,301,29915,4422,895,592,6023,1249,29889,1720,18062,10440,818,534,8885,966,15378,1295,4145,1099,14125,316,5541,1934,29889,6803,712,443,8694,29892,7890,282,6223,29920,269,29915,29891,1841,3090,914,26814,13745,6710,2535,425,521,744,332,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,2831,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,263,9554,2969,363,263,23904,16346,293,5518,393,1033,19998,367,1304,304,1653,263,716,1134,310,16988,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,3732,263,2854,1298,1048,278,27028,310,13807,10193,583,322,278,817,363,263,901,8543,322,15075,475,519,1650,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,5995,393,23904,16346,293,17279,526,278,1650,29889,2688,3763,2106,393,372,338,376,264,553,5697,3246,16380,793,29908,1728,13138,738,4902,373,920,1438,17105,664,470,2020,896,526,901,11828,1135,13807,16988,17279,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,5518,896,526,9551,292,1033,367,1304,304,1653,263,716,1134,310,16988,29892,541,896,437,451,5649,920,445,723,664,470,825,278,25486,310,1316,263,16988,723,367,29889,2688,3763,2106,393,372,723,367,376,348,7006,4191,1559,5606,2265,16380,28758,818,301,29915,29874,10651,637,270,29915,29949,2096,29948,550,1699,1728,13138,738,3030,470,8252,363,2020,445,723,367,7282,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,505,1476,263,982,304,5557,278,17105,515,12070,292,4208,491,1302,1218,963,411,263,15878,7546,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,445,1736,470,825,4072,310,17279,1033,367,1304,363,445,6437,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,385,8031,2969,363,263,716,1134,310,16988,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,2472,470,10757,304,8072,7602,1239,278,13254,310,967,7037,2779,20193,29889,319,901,12912,20657,322,13173,8252,310,278,5518,322,967,4426,723,367,4312,304,20408,1943,278,20026,310,967,2778,1169,29889],"total_duration":75244280474,"load_duration":157579,"prompt_eval_count":288,"prompt_eval_duration":27094005000,"eval_count":359,"eval_duration":48149649000}
