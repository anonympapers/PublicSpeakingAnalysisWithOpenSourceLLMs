{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T07:18:47.956536541Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker presents a clear and concise argument for why the EU should be more proactive in defending its values and principles, particularly in the face of indifference from citizens. They also provide some alternatives to the current situation, which shows that they have thought through the issue thoroughly. However, the speech lacks a strong call to action, which could make it more persuasive for the audience.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker provides some logical arguments and examples to support their claims. For instance, they argue that cutting funding for projects in states that do not respect EU values would send a message that the union is serious about its principles. However, the speech could benefit from more empirical evidence and data to support these claims, which would make the reasoning more rigorous.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear argument and provides some thoughtful alternatives, the speech could be more persuasive and rigorously reasoned with additional evidence and a stronger call to action.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,259,29941,27809,610,17488,301,29915,13094,1436,749,553,410,27499,1465,521,562,348,553,2852,1446,18490,29889,6803,339,7768,452,2331,3581,546,454,13104,379,29889,405,29915,575,882,1671,966,2852,1446,18490,1750,452,3390,10978,2331,966,20368,1295,316,301,29915,13094,29973,2581,16193,553,27809,29889,365,29915,524,1064,11992,1671,8556,427,11172,712,274,2049,11771,707,904,12324,29872,29889,315,29915,342,316,4048,6390,6722,8556,599,787,29889,365,29915,524,1064,11992,1671,301,29915,13094,29211,707,8648,29403,29889,1459,346,439,29915,30001,1601,4771,29892,454,26379,25698,5000,316,301,29915,13094,29211,274,29915,342,2331,454,5826,29916,277,29889,315,29915,342,301,29915,513,2593,1064,663,553,274,2049,29891,575,29889,1551,454,24722,2535,966,27254,17611,9387,1750,269,29915,9961,1173,634,1750,302,29915,351,19047,2331,363,29883,15471,966,285,681,29889,10793,15373,274,29915,342,553,10419,800,15237,427,629,275,634,11797,4625,16794,29948,1597,12784,9577,2560,29889,315,29915,342,818,301,29915,2467,316,301,29915,13094,29211,1671,263,1241,818,12507,369,6267,18551,316,425,16158,16909,347,29892,6267,18551,316,301,29915,16061,17950,29889,1720,592,3031,569,712,1671,1104,25856,443,15744,17611,264,1750,3700,1072,381,966,285,681,29892,980,21668,11469,553,20368,1295,1750,452,577,993,2298,712,553,5829,267,1750,3435,6668,339,743,1465,443,17887,19480,270,29915,14856,1318,17611,264,3503,439,29915,1808,2906,7081,1597,22259,2131,1671,8556,274,2049,29891,575,1465,24145,6316,316,9411,966,16283,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,3022,895,2980,363,2020,278,19007,881,367,901,410,4925,297,822,2548,967,1819,322,18671,29892,10734,297,278,3700,310,1399,17678,515,18363,29889,2688,884,3867,777,27809,304,278,1857,6434,29892,607,3697,393,896,505,2714,1549,278,2228,26606,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,263,4549,1246,304,3158,29892,607,1033,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,363,278,20026,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,8128,777,16667,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,27754,393,28967,5220,292,363,9279,297,5922,393,437,451,3390,19007,1819,723,3638,263,2643,393,278,9833,338,10676,1048,967,18671,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,1033,14169,515,901,29190,936,10757,322,848,304,2304,1438,16726,29892,607,723,1207,278,24481,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,2980,322,8128,777,2714,1319,27809,29892,278,12032,1033,367,901,20408,294,573,322,12912,272,5794,2769,287,411,5684,10757,322,263,23505,1246,304,3158,29889],"total_duration":60437516018,"load_duration":212114,"prompt_eval_count":306,"prompt_eval_duration":28088623000,"eval_count":253,"eval_duration":32348264000}
