{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T21:23:07.535015007Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 on the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument for the development of new materials for carbon capture and conversion, using a combination of technical language and simple explanations to make their point accessible to a wide audience. They provide specific examples of the progress they have made so far, which adds credibility to their claims.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the speech could be improved to increase its persuasiveness:\n\n1. Emotional connection: While the speaker mentions the potential impact of their work on the environment, they could do more to create an emotional connection with the audience. By sharing personal stories or highlighting the benefits of their research for everyday people, they could make their message more relatable and engaging.\n2. Clear call to action: The speaker provides some information about the potential applications of their new materials, but they could do more to clearly outline what they need from their audience in terms of support or action. Providing specific asks or next steps could help to mobilize the audience and increase their sense of ownership in the project.\n3. Addressing potential objections: The speaker does a good job of presenting their case, but they could do more to anticipate and address potential objections or concerns that the audience may have. By acknowledging potential criticisms and providing thoughtful responses, they could build trust and credibility with their audience.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a strong argument for the development of new materials for carbon capture and conversion, but could benefit from some additional refinements to make their message even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,1513,882,22700,743,610,425,9460,29889,365,29915,3318,361,316,5792,17449,707,316,10628,7869,553,10984,2993,1775,4894,2993,1671,5278,20491,1924,19069,11381,18097,302,29915,932,4999,553,20612,17246,952,5908,634,6079,2257,3435,553,12647,29899,535,2199,943,4191,454,20562,3594,311,29899,20752,744,323,601,29899,29906,29892,270,29915,459,29948,862,553,302,16469,16530,2540,11510,284,492,1912,634,1750,3435,2117,1849,316,9678,381,454,4810,29906,29892,373,16158,1772,24618,1297,29892,818,2298,22916,29892,1224,454,1841,1089,29887,19971,29892,4191,454,11510,284,634,454,11510,284,29889,951,4313,12161,553,10850,28141,938,1355,316,7015,1775,4894,2993,29892,2649,267,712,425,260,8284,29892,425,5469,553,11840,1044,10270,29892,634,425,18131,5458,316,7015,1936,2540,29892,1223,545,1597,15378,545,7199,29948,29882,2673,316,6267,9122,316,18165,17239,818,301,29915,17192,1808,29892,9200,21785,1387,29892,2257,1750,592,14924,7209,270,2663,610,425,9460,270,29915,314,15817,9386,6267,5039,2131,818,301,29915,17192,1808,11758,21785,1387,29889,8748,6079,29892,966,6896,19718,712,432,29915,1794,11878,9291,29915,30001,301,29915,2611,424,3435,9577,2504,300,2153,29892,634,1444,7847,22944,1597,626,15817,12418,4991,1230,316,425,4180,316,7015,10984,2993,1775,4894,2993,29892,2257,1750,592,18332,831,1129,381,316,1791,261,1190,5278,18249,634,452,2331,16454,818,6128,29889,3872,29883,4883,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,5246,267,29899,4346,29875,1970,8837,634,452,3810,29920,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,363,278,5849,310,716,17279,363,22004,10446,322,11301,29892,773,263,10296,310,16905,4086,322,2560,7309,800,304,1207,1009,1298,15579,304,263,9377,20026,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,310,278,6728,896,505,1754,577,2215,29892,607,12778,6625,4127,304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,263,2846,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,304,7910,967,20408,294,20193,29901,13,13,29896,29889,2812,327,1848,3957,29901,5806,278,25657,26649,278,7037,10879,310,1009,664,373,278,5177,29892,896,1033,437,901,304,1653,385,23023,1848,3957,411,278,20026,29889,2648,19383,7333,15874,470,12141,292,278,23633,310,1009,5925,363,1432,3250,2305,29892,896,1033,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,322,3033,6751,29889,13,29906,29889,17732,1246,304,3158,29901,450,25657,8128,777,2472,1048,278,7037,8324,310,1009,716,17279,29892,541,896,1033,437,901,304,9436,27887,825,896,817,515,1009,20026,297,4958,310,2304,470,3158,29889,9133,4821,2702,19514,470,2446,6576,1033,1371,304,27227,675,278,20026,322,7910,1009,4060,310,27428,297,278,2060,29889,13,29941,29889,16428,292,7037,704,24247,29901,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,1206,29892,541,896,1033,437,901,304,23483,403,322,3211,7037,704,24247,470,21838,393,278,20026,1122,505,29889,2648,24084,3460,7037,11164,12903,322,13138,2714,1319,20890,29892,896,1033,2048,9311,322,6625,4127,411,1009,20026,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,4549,2980,363,278,5849,310,716,17279,363,22004,10446,322,11301,29892,541,1033,14169,515,777,5684,2143,262,4110,304,1207,1009,2643,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":73402911619,"load_duration":232902,"prompt_eval_count":298,"prompt_eval_duration":27153336000,"eval_count":357,"eval_duration":46248789000}
