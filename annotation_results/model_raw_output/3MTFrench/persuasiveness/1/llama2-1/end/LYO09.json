{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T09:18:26.886420289Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, using evidence and examples to support their claims. They also acknowledge potential limitations and concerns, such as the potential for damage to healthy cells.\n\nThe speaker's use of rhetorical devices, such as metaphors and hyperbole, adds impact and emphasis to their message. The repetition of key phrases, such as \"nos organes\" and \"hyper efficace,\" also serves to drive home the main points of the speech.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened. For example, the speaker could have provided more specific examples of how the vaccine has been used in the past to successfully train the immune system, and how it has helped to protect against diseases. Additionally, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or concerns about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a strong and persuasive argument, but there are some areas where additional evidence and detail could be provided to further support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,24145,21423,5198,348,9407,1750,2299,1981,1249,1601,4880,1671,8556,410,6772,914,8474,966,297,1725,1953,29892,640,993,553,260,1132,267,29892,553,19518,270,29915,283,29890,283,267,1750,18475,13365,296,427,5646,1298,443,2553,898,17887,269,2736,271,634,1750,1671,29873,424,269,29915,370,866,7814,2894,267,29889,1459,2460,7015,260,1132,267,29892,373,427,263,2893,29792,1597,1841,1639,571,787,818,2123,29888,818,29835,316,4889,18142,21101,316,425,15481,371,8474,966,24424,427,11172,4226,29892,12866,269,29915,513,456,915,316,1444,1314,2646,1475,634,966,5814,1237,427,9201,6815,4323,2131,634,316,325,819,5273,29888,4350,29889,853,1354,23068,818,24145,325,5753,262,1006,932,15819,29892,3503,270,29915,1540,3444,18097,6701,29892,1841,1639,571,787,818,2123,29888,818,1750,694,30085,29879,29892,2123,28185,9373,1190,479,424,443,3829,1750,694,30085,29879,29892,3503,2331,419,356,29892,3503,11266,6366,815,1671,1841,296,336,30058,1089,454,21423,5198,348,9407,427,28353,7814,3041,359,3246,270,29915,19880,29882,743,29892,634,270,29915,442,26231,316,24145,5075,1318,29892,373,263,1841,375,1039,818,10135,374,7808,553,3677,293,4339,2656,267,316,5227,30058,6609,367,2993,4768,1189,3783,1354,7890,28078,11867,29892,3503,7209,966,2432,29885,482,1302,339,2620,2993,29892,1671,564,3511,1354,1506,30095,27493,443,782,600,271,29892,1841,26880,1190,425,5039,2131,634,22964,2853,818,425,2432,29885,482,29889,5334,17103,29892,1465,611,266,17449,29892,373,263,1841,375,1039,818,4327,261,7814,269,473,790,30000,6609,878,30000,1041,427,4768,290,15819,316,425,1766,328,347,427,2123,316,19696,371,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,773,10757,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2688,884,18145,5485,7037,27028,322,21838,29892,1316,408,278,7037,363,18658,304,9045,29891,9101,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,29892,1316,408,1539,12451,943,322,11266,833,280,29892,12778,10879,322,19310,275,304,1009,2643,29889,450,21159,654,310,1820,12216,2129,29892,1316,408,376,17639,2894,267,29908,322,376,24947,6366,815,1699,884,19700,304,7899,3271,278,1667,3291,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,310,920,278,325,5753,457,756,1063,1304,297,278,4940,304,8472,7945,278,5198,1540,1788,29892,322,920,372,756,9213,304,12566,2750,10267,2129,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,21838,1048,278,15332,322,6366,4135,310,278,325,5753,457,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,4549,322,20408,294,573,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,5684,10757,322,9493,1033,367,4944,304,4340,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":63124346317,"load_duration":228360,"prompt_eval_count":330,"prompt_eval_duration":30565927000,"eval_count":256,"eval_duration":32557549000}
