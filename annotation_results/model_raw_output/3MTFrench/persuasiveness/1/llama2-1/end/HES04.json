{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T11:59:42.602459458Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. Here's why:\n\nPersuasiveness: The speaker presents their idea in a straightforward manner, but there is no clear evidence or logical reasoning to support their claim. They simply state that they can create a simulation of Robert's voice using a database of possible responses to user movements. While this concept may be interesting and potentially useful, the speaker does not provide any details on how this would work or what benefits it could bring. Therefore, the speech lacks persuasiveness as there is no clear explanation or evidence to support the claim. Score: 3\n\nRigor of reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is somewhat rigorous in that they acknowledge the limitations of current technology and the potential usefulness of their proposed solution. However, they do not provide any logical arguments or evidence to support their claim beyond simply stating that it could be done. Therefore, the speech lacks rigor in its reasoning as there is no clear explanation or evidence to support the claim. Score: 3\n\nOverall, while the speaker's idea may have potential, the speech lacks persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning, resulting in a score of 3 out of 5.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,838,943,1120,424,2970,712,1190,301,29915,4194,7289,316,4755,2535,1487,878,4196,9580,2093,344,332,29892,1597,3514,326,8634,26030,19445,5278,17478,29889,3872,29883,1444,26099,18948,1089,818,1601,289,13411,1671,1841,700,533,425,2653,9948,316,3408,23309,29889,8748,16257,29611,610,5646,818,18679,454,8694,29889,8748,3667,7608,553,953,29885,30000,793,634,6701,3093,3751,4467,712,1671,425,22259,2131,4610,13498,29889,6803,10628,7869,443,18308,7840,22756,427,22259,2131,4610,13498,29892,373,24108,610,10719,261,1597,2967,316,21880,1750,640,993,14984,966,25179,787,267,6458,793,316,301,29915,21813,17239,316,18308,29889,8526,9411,966,20758,4110,6458,793,316,301,29915,4422,275,7289,29889,1174,13495,29892,5278,2967,316,21880,707,9151,1318,1465,301,29915,4194,7289,868,8694,29889,8748,28194,13704,269,29915,342,5246,443,25924,29892,1487,22420,7289,302,29915,29874,439,29915,30001,5769,261,425,2967,1671,2656,381,1597,1841,1713,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,309,343,263,443,14426,273,15471,29889,8748,6079,1671,18402,1027,309,1061,29899,9161,29892,274,29915,342,425,6701,12784,29889,2581,325,1759,10719,261,1597,2967,316,21880,1671,425,22759,285,1064,1318,29889,1174,13495,29892,28194,4755,6427,8284,2331,1190,872,22759,4610,13498,29892,1487,22420,7289,302,29915,29874,2002,439,29915,30001,5769,261,425,2967,1671,2656,381,1597,1841,1713,427,11387,316,29871,29941,6233,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,373,610,280,427,29871,29941,6233,316,7890,425,29415,29889,5462,425,1027,309,1061,316,4755,325,993,316,409,1840,4983,1354,1444,452,325,1759,2331,966,1437,305,381,29889,1720,21668,454,17043,29415,29889,1720,2947,10440,16454,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,15136,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,20837,8214,29892,541,727,338,694,2821,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,2688,3763,2106,393,896,508,1653,263,17402,310,4755,29915,29879,7314,773,263,2566,310,1950,20890,304,1404,24147,29889,5806,445,6964,1122,367,8031,322,19998,5407,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,4902,373,920,445,723,664,470,825,23633,372,1033,6963,29889,7857,29892,278,12032,425,4684,20408,294,20193,408,727,338,694,2821,8252,470,10757,304,2304,278,5995,29889,2522,487,29901,29871,29941,13,13,29934,335,272,310,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,10579,12912,20657,297,393,896,18145,5485,278,27028,310,1857,15483,322,278,7037,5407,2264,310,1009,7972,1650,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,16667,6273,470,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,8724,3763,23659,393,372,1033,367,2309,29889,7857,29892,278,12032,425,4684,12912,272,297,967,24481,408,727,338,694,2821,8252,470,10757,304,2304,278,5995,29889,2522,487,29901,29871,29941,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,2969,1122,505,7037,29892,278,12032,425,4684,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29892,9819,297,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,29889],"total_duration":64033480168,"load_duration":278953,"prompt_eval_count":331,"prompt_eval_duration":28961856000,"eval_count":282,"eval_duration":35069023000}
