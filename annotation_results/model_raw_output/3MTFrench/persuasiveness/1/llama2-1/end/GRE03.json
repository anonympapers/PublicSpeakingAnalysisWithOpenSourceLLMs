{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T07:30:14.251865194Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some valid points and techniques for managing stress and emotions, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker claims that they have found a way to measure the effectiveness of their intervention by comparing the hair growth patterns of their clients before and after treatment. However, this method seems unreliable and lacks scientific backing. There is no mention of any studies or research that support this claim, which raises doubts about its validity.\n\nFurthermore, the speaker's argumentation is sometimes based on unsubstantiated assumptions. For example, they claim that learning how to manage stress and emotions is not taught in school, implying that their techniques are unique and effective. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, as many schools and educational institutions offer courses and programs on stress management and emotional intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's language and tone can come across as dismissive and condescending at times, which may undermine their credibility and persuasiveness. For instance, they use phrases like \"on n'apprend pas à l'école des bonnes paroles\" (you don't learn good words at school), which could be seen as belittling the educational system.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas and techniques for managing stress and emotions, their argumentation could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based support. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects this mixed performance in terms of persuasiveness.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1750,1998,296,818,1841,9176,1089,427,610,385,29892,21975,425,724,1690,2131,868,3060,861,29892,21975,425,26470,29889,8407,9587,270,29915,14830,631,29892,4581,29899,29963,1740,29899,9780,263,623,28759,316,11043,316,26805,316,22884,29892,553,5644,1475,27688,29892,553,330,2297,553,904,14817,1080,2923,293,5475,29889,11948,29892,3440,4048,6390,712,1601,1006,7316,302,29915,342,6366,815,29973,382,29882,6079,29892,1444,285,1572,275,1465,425,17949,553,610,787,29889,478,681,1671,2546,29920,7890,2970,29892,4875,263,11643,1189,434,12866,29892,274,29915,342,4226,29892,3503,1444,1072,19755,3479,4047,7147,923,345,1314,29889,6803,904,791,2853,301,29915,29948,2416,562,2131,316,5278,1006,7316,29892,432,29915,1794,301,29915,1466,544,3610,15792,553,5697,3246,8575,267,316,923,345,1314,29892,10042,634,818,425,9073,553,1824,4467,29892,1671,5734,261,454,260,2993,316,13979,275,324,2117,2911,533,29892,1766,7808,287,868,22884,17168,1387,29892,634,4323,3709,301,29915,19880,941,316,425,286,4894,29878,362,316,301,29915,19880,941,553,1644,1691,634,553,289,25747,5888,29889,1551,302,29915,932,28759,2331,818,301,29915,29948,10936,818,553,22983,289,24729,610,787,29889,29871,30219,29874,25810,553,6079,29899,509,30069,29880,2925,22299,29892,8164,29899,5474,6701,8275,347,29889,315,29915,342,1671,339,7768,29892,1465,611,25902,29892,432,29915,9297,347,316,534,8885,553,6851,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,322,13698,363,767,6751,22884,322,23023,1080,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,16726,393,896,505,1476,263,982,304,5645,278,2779,20193,310,1009,1006,7316,491,17420,278,11315,14321,15038,310,1009,13154,1434,322,1156,14502,29889,2398,29892,445,1158,2444,443,276,492,519,322,425,4684,16021,27436,29889,1670,338,694,3585,310,738,11898,470,5925,393,2304,445,5995,29892,607,1153,4637,27455,1372,1048,967,2854,537,29889,13,13,29943,332,721,5514,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,362,338,6041,2729,373,443,22492,3656,630,20813,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,6509,920,304,10933,22884,322,23023,1080,338,451,16187,297,3762,29892,2411,5890,393,1009,13698,526,5412,322,11828,29889,2398,29892,727,338,694,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29892,408,1784,12462,322,28976,21561,5957,21888,322,11104,373,22884,10643,322,23023,1848,21082,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,4086,322,16225,508,2041,4822,408,18918,573,322,2148,9977,2548,472,3064,29892,607,1122,563,837,457,1009,6625,4127,322,20408,294,20193,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,671,12216,2129,763,376,265,302,29915,932,28759,2331,818,301,29915,29948,10936,553,289,24729,610,6544,29908,313,6293,1016,29915,29873,5110,1781,3838,472,3762,511,607,1033,367,3595,408,1339,986,1847,278,28976,1788,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,322,13698,363,767,6751,22884,322,23023,1080,29892,1009,2980,362,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,29899,6707,2304,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,445,12849,4180,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889],"total_duration":72131283031,"load_duration":240078,"prompt_eval_count":282,"prompt_eval_duration":25724672000,"eval_count":365,"eval_duration":46405818000}
