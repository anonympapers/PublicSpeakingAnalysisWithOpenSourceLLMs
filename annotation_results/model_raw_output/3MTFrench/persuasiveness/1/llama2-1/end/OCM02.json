The speaker presents their arguments in a clear and structured manner, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker mentions that the main challenges they faced were finding data that were \"presque impossible à trouver dans cette région.\" While this is a valid point, it would have been more persuasive if they had provided more details on why these specific datasets were difficult to obtain and how their research was impacted by this.\n\nSecondly, the speaker mentions that they used sociological methods and questionnaires to gather data from the indigenous population. While this is an important aspect of the research, it would have been more convincing if they had provided more details on how these methods were chosen and why they were deemed appropriate for the study.\n\nLastly, the speaker mentions that they hope to develop a functional model at the end of the research project. However, the transcript does not provide any information on what this model would entail or how it would be used to protect the population.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their arguments in a clear and structured manner, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and detailed to make the speech more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2664,11482,275,21349,634,611,6987,3435,553,289,24729,21880,4555,432,29915,1794,2594,793,925,882,267,29889,1459,2257,1750,707,610,346,439,29915,2719,3435,544,6947,2658,29892,2225,802,9301,818,534,8885,1465,5278,14326,29889,21678,29920,29899,29886,1947,7015,11482,275,818,29871,29941,29889,29947,29889,29896,29889,22310,2131,316,301,29915,29923,8101,904,280,1524,29889,29871,29906,29889,1459,16589,12416,966,6896,29038,316,315,3774,496,18934,270,29915,29891,27786,553,16355,17546,1188,3783,634,4883,332,743,270,29915,271,459,4437,2535,9411,966,20854,2234,16253,7147,29889,8748,29871,29941,29889,289,25747,9639,631,966,1518,4894,2063,553,1120,2878,880,267,4625,301,29915,4422,4371,553,8774,386,2631,5374,1189,3783,634,553,1139,1056,2658,29889,8526,425,1436,316,5278,263,794,545,29892,1444,5152,1908,11469,818,878,15340,18165,9139,15390,270,29915,1540,1601,509,1318,270,29915,348,18926,4280,29872,868,360,2554,868,10275,535,29889,6803,410,6772,914,425,4665,1887,29892,8474,966,7019,22495,1446,634,966,297,898,800,29889,8748,1671,439,29915,309,707,6896,5289,29892,2653,5582,2145,2853,818,269,29915,296,631,29892,1224,270,29915,29874,23589,29892,3669,645,404,347,818,2298,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,6273,297,263,2821,322,2281,2955,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,1667,18066,267,896,20050,892,9138,848,393,892,376,4569,802,9301,818,534,8885,1465,5278,14326,1213,5806,445,338,263,2854,1298,29892,372,723,505,1063,901,20408,294,573,565,896,750,4944,901,4902,373,2020,1438,2702,20035,892,5189,304,4017,322,920,1009,5925,471,10879,287,491,445,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,1304,5374,5996,3519,322,1139,1056,2658,304,11705,848,515,278,1399,2101,681,4665,29889,5806,445,338,385,4100,9565,310,278,5925,29892,372,723,505,1063,901,17953,3277,565,896,750,4944,901,4902,373,920,1438,3519,892,10434,322,2020,896,892,316,22580,8210,363,278,6559,29889,13,13,8897,368,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,4966,304,2693,263,13303,1904,472,278,1095,310,278,5925,2060,29889,2398,29892,278,1301,924,947,451,3867,738,2472,373,825,445,1904,723,875,737,470,920,372,723,367,1304,304,12566,278,4665,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,6273,297,263,2821,322,2281,2955,8214,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,13173,304,1207,278,12032,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":57776819662,"load_duration":190951,"prompt_eval_count":243,"prompt_eval_duration":21700781000,"eval_count":289,"eval_duration":36075465000}
