{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:13:06.987717993Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give the speech a score of 4 out of 5 on the persuasiveness scale. The speaker is able to effectively craft a convincing message and present a clear and well-reasoned argument for their proposed solution. They provide specific examples and use rhetorical devices such as metaphors (e.g., \"une fois l'istérique, elle gives des coups de balais au plafond\") and repetition (\"On espère pouvoir les offrir en opération bientôt\") to emphasize their points and make their message more compelling.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speech could be improved. For example, the speaker could have provided more detail on how the proposed solution will address the problem at hand, and provided more specific examples of how it will benefit the target audience. Additionally, the speech could have benefited from more variety in tone and pace to keep the listener engaged.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-crafted and effectively presents the proposed solution, there are some areas where it could be improved to make it even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1597,10098,301,29915,391,20600,29892,4875,18332,553,3581,567,316,6411,1759,782,2174,29888,898,29892,634,4875,14931,5644,262,316,2011,267,818,1813,694,312,595,267,29889,838,943,29892,2257,3256,29899,27048,29892,373,263,29892,373,3686,29874,347,316,13942,29877,2496,4239,2134,6609,1671,623,9555,553,6851,782,10212,20141,29889,997,8861,29892,29871,4277,263,4370,14937,625,634,301,29915,352,1908,29889,1551,1083,6689,454,29758,262,26535,1240,569,29889,1551,263,4100,553,3038,2540,1616,12906,7147,29892,4555,274,29915,342,439,29915,4999,269,29915,296,355,24416,6079,2535,966,10890,12173,316,301,29915,26917,29889,997,26617,29892,634,3856,373,2947,3686,2747,316,454,7199,9030,2257,29758,262,29889,830,2818,336,3999,1098,5326,29889,7747,1750,3911,21668,443,3209,802,29892,443,13164,1775,295,294,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,454,24305,316,26957,6062,29948,21337,29892,805,4582,361,3783,316,3038,2540,274,29915,342,1223,296,29889,8748,12866,5278,15217,6635,2445,7661,316,1020,17334,29892,966,623,1379,29892,966,885,1690,720,29948,2390,583,29889,1551,5152,1908,19397,966,1283,12416,427,1015,362,289,993,9373,29889,4241,841,424,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,7890,9073,1597,2504,5340,712,2257,18848,2947,8556,263,1241,818,12036,261,29889,997,8861,270,29915,348,9122,29892,6722,373,1791,1572,28273,267,29892,373,1671,336,2145,2853,818,12278,1875,29892,818,2600,1524,24145,11449,29892,2298,1472,27761,29889,341,5093,1354,373,263,603,2331,454,439,1789,29874,29889,853,9122,29892,6722,28185,9373,712,270,29915,1175,5561,553,8595,818,425,6316,29892,373,13612,5561,29874,316,425,6316,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,278,12032,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,6287,29889,450,25657,338,2221,304,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,263,2821,322,1532,29899,23147,287,2980,363,1009,7972,1650,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,322,671,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,1539,12451,943,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,1540,10098,301,29915,391,20600,29892,4875,4076,553,3581,567,316,6411,1759,782,2174,29888,898,1159,322,21159,654,4852,2951,5152,1908,19397,966,1283,12416,427,1015,10500,289,993,9373,1159,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,1207,1009,2643,901,752,7807,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,9493,373,920,278,7972,1650,674,3211,278,1108,472,1361,29892,322,4944,901,2702,6455,310,920,372,674,14169,278,3646,20026,29889,19814,29892,278,12032,1033,505,7795,1573,515,901,12875,297,16225,322,27725,304,3013,278,13254,17785,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,1532,29899,17293,287,322,17583,22981,278,7972,1650,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,372,1033,367,16710,304,1207,372,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":60013452421,"load_duration":168963,"prompt_eval_count":328,"prompt_eval_duration":29667631000,"eval_count":240,"eval_duration":30345154000}
