{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:11:08.304914561Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does not provide rigorous reasoning or convincing evidence to support their argument that changing the way we define things can combat radicalization. While they raise some valid points about the vagueness of the term \"radicalization\" and the need for more specific language, their overall message is too vague and lacks concrete examples or data to back it up.\n\nThe speaker also relies heavily on rhetorical questions and empty phrases, such as \"pourquoi le droit est identifiable\" and \"quelle chose on a juste du malheureux monde,\" which do not contribute to a persuasive argument. Additionally, the use of sarcasm and hyperbole (\"t'arbouche,\" \"t'es pas possible\") detracts from the speaker's credibility and makes their argument less compelling.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some valid points about the need for more precise language in discussing radicalization, their speech is not persuasive enough to convince the listener of its merits.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,553,6013,2925,782,17950,610,346,712,454,17950,707,2893,28677,29889,997,3036,744,452,966,760,29889,2581,1236,1314,14954,4630,443,19696,371,316,17950,29892,1444,1236,1314,2331,14954,4630,443,19696,371,316,3036,744,29889,1174,13495,29892,373,452,8164,2331,425,29415,1190,443,6701,3814,29889,8748,2535,443,6701,20689,29892,425,24818,4371,29892,1597,26744,1750,25810,17756,9073,425,12573,634,1597,14857,29892,1750,409,1539,3018,1564,993,818,9364,276,427,4464,316,432,29915,1794,29899,29880,29915,370,562,29892,274,681,29883,681,29892,289,485,283,1173,29892,260,29915,279,29890,283,1173,29892,260,29915,267,2331,1950,29889,8748,7847,29892,980,21668,1874,261,24145,26722,316,1437,4951,381,966,521,15806,29889,1459,11867,316,24818,4371,29892,274,29915,342,9201,25160,29889,1459,11867,270,29915,11236,6386,5537,1237,29892,274,29915,342,2298,7175,3476,29889,1459,11867,316,872,425,29888,6386,29892,452,8556,623,28759,21181,29889,1459,11867,316,26379,9744,3479,301,29915,16748,291,29876,9230,29892,282,20342,634,2298,3711,381,29889,8748,7847,29892,980,21668,4963,942,27937,29948,316,28078,417,381,27227,7608,553,5829,267,4191,2730,11771,316,26811,275,29889,365,6463,8474,425,24818,4371,818,4595,29899,13147,276,634,970,29892,274,29915,342,9577,432,5079,29892,3503,29871,4277,452,2453,329,21181,2970,29889,319,4951,6311,29892,4875,289,6269,314,434,818,425,18836,29889,8526,4439,29892,301,29915,9706,9509,12784,373,263,925,29872,868,4439,28661,1314,9122,29889,838,943,29892,1444,452,544,1893,355,2331,818,1277,357,2298,316,10814,354,332,2535,15093,260,15532,29892,432,29915,9983,1908,443,7006,2298,316,7019,2764,2131,634,316,18729,29889,2581,724,1794,6079,540,545,1314,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,451,3867,12912,20657,24481,470,17953,3277,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,393,6480,278,982,591,4529,2712,508,15499,24818,2133,29889,5806,896,12020,777,2854,3291,1048,278,325,351,3837,404,310,278,1840,376,3665,936,2133,29908,322,278,817,363,901,2702,4086,29892,1009,12463,2643,338,2086,25160,322,425,4684,18387,6455,470,848,304,1250,372,701,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,337,3687,20365,373,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,4069,12216,2129,29892,1316,408,376,29886,473,339,7768,454,17950,707,2893,28677,29908,322,376,19443,12784,373,263,925,29872,868,4439,28661,1314,9122,1699,607,437,451,29126,304,263,20408,294,573,2980,29889,19814,29892,278,671,310,269,5666,11625,322,11266,833,280,4852,29873,29915,279,29890,283,1173,1699,376,29873,29915,267,2331,1950,1159,1439,1461,29879,515,278,25657,29915,29879,6625,4127,322,3732,1009,2980,3109,752,7807,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,2854,3291,1048,278,817,363,901,18378,4086,297,5353,292,24818,2133,29892,1009,12032,338,451,20408,294,573,3307,304,7602,1239,278,13254,310,967,2778,1169,29889],"total_duration":63134435359,"load_duration":151183,"prompt_eval_count":341,"prompt_eval_duration":31547652000,"eval_count":251,"eval_duration":31586162000}
