Here's why:\n\nThe speaker does a good job of using technical terms and mathematical concepts to support their argument, which shows a level of expertise and understanding of the topic. They also provide some concrete examples to illustrate their points, which helps to make their message more relatable and persuasive.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve in order to make their argument even more convincing. For example, they could provide more context and background information on the topic to help the audience understand the significance of the issue at hand. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more specific examples or case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of their proposed solution.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does a good job of presenting their argument, there is room for improvement in terms of providing more context and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,4422,895,966,286,30037,4467,3420,267,29889,435,29915,1794,1841,700,277,425,4323,2131,553,21880,3483,952,2406,1671,534,8885,25595,358,966,19313,1750,8556,26842,404,296,29889,435,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,12866,1671,10628,7869,553,13698,553,878,30000,793,5844,2249,19669,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,337,4926,818,553,878,30000,793,5844,2249,19669,1750,286,29915,609,3635,275,316,9484,261,553,878,30000,793,5844,2249,19669,1671,454,878,15340,5844,2249,15819,29892,2257,712,1444,286,29915,264,3635,895,316,9484,261,553,21880,316,27516,553,21880,316,9484,261,553,21880,2257,712,1444,286,29915,264,337,1050,5295,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,773,16905,4958,322,19475,22001,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,607,3697,263,3233,310,17924,895,322,8004,310,278,11261,29889,2688,884,3867,777,18387,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,607,6911,304,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,322,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,297,1797,304,1207,1009,2980,1584,901,17953,3277,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,3867,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,304,1371,278,20026,2274,278,26002,310,278,2228,472,1361,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,470,1206,11898,304,28475,278,2779,20193,310,1009,7972,1650,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,29892,727,338,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,13138,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":39429209694,"load_duration":219840,"prompt_eval_count":139,"prompt_eval_duration":12604455000,"eval_count":213,"eval_duration":26824002000}
