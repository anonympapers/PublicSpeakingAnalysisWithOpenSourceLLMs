{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T12:43:14.025460699Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. While the speaker attempts to make an argument that all relationships are based on the Council of Europe and the Akur, their reasoning is not rigorous and lacks evidence. The speaker simply asserts that the decision of Russia has been a revolution for Europe, without providing any specific examples or data to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's use of \"c'est vrai\" (it's true) and \"merci\" (thank you) at the end of the speech gives the impression of a lack of conviction in their argument. Overall, the speaker's argument is not well-supported and lacks persuasive power.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,2062,9030,29892,1444,14954,1173,818,1601,509,261,712,14984,966,5302,724,10978,868,782,5246,712,301,29915,542,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,868,25774,316,4092,634,301,29915,29909,23843,707,443,610,29888,1249,634,712,454,4719,347,263,443,2134,29888,28899,275,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,868,9122,818,712,316,734,260,29915,29948,280,369,818,425,10466,29892,427,4327,261,29892,634,454,25774,316,4092,634,301,29915,29909,23843,29889,365,29915,24768,985,4233,29892,425,4224,2459,316,425,4719,347,263,4370,1597,29835,316,1841,4068,1671,301,29915,29877,3200,29948,316,4092,29892,4875,263,1034,29886,29948,818,443,3300,457,316,29871,29941,27188,787,29889,11948,707,29899,346,712,5278,1841,4068,263,330,355,5606,2298,316,6079,712,316,4439,29973,315,29915,342,269,30095,29878,712,454,4092,29892,274,29915,342,325,17016,11387,443,8348,352,29948,29899,6772,29892,274,29915,342,316,425,4719,347,1750,707,3300,347,29889,951,25774,316,4092,707,425,1034,29886,29948,818,443,316,29871,29941,27188,787,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,5806,278,25657,14734,304,1207,385,2980,393,599,21702,526,2729,373,278,8831,310,4092,322,278,10813,332,29892,1009,24481,338,451,12912,20657,322,425,4684,10757,29889,450,25657,3763,408,643,1372,393,278,10608,310,12710,756,1063,263,19479,363,4092,29892,1728,13138,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,376,29883,29915,342,325,17016,29908,313,277,29915,29879,1565,29897,322,376,1050,455,29908,313,386,804,366,29897,472,278,1095,310,278,12032,4076,278,17188,310,263,10225,310,7602,2463,297,1009,2980,29889,6811,497,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,451,1532,29899,23765,322,425,4684,20408,294,573,3081,29889],"total_duration":40267976785,"load_duration":225997,"prompt_eval_count":213,"prompt_eval_duration":19705708000,"eval_count":166,"eval_duration":20561530000}
