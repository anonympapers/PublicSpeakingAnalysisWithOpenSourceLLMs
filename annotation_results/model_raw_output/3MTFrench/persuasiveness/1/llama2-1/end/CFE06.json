The speaker presents some interesting and innovative ideas about using bacteria to treat diseases, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's claim that they can \"sonier\" an infection and even take it on themselves to help develop a new medication is quite intriguing. However, without further explanation or evidence, it is difficult to fully understand how this would work. Additionally, the speaker's assertion that their approach could potentially lead to a breakthrough in understanding the mechanisms of disease transmission and treatment is ambitious, but may be challenging to achieve without more concrete data.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker acknowledges the potential risks associated with their approach, they do not provide a detailed analysis of these risks or how they would be mitigated. This lack of consideration for potential drawbacks reduces the persuasiveness of their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's ideas are interesting and worth exploring further, there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported to make a stronger case for their proposed approach.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6101,373,432,2353,443,29871,30106,309,818,1487,22191,26052,4670,19971,634,818,1487,21423,5198,348,9407,29892,8556,1029,787,21394,316,3291,818,3817,29889,1174,544,15819,29892,1444,325,1759,1326,29877,7808,1597,16987,4556,14255,2257,17887,13019,29892,443,2329,424,5758,295,1671,3911,29889,11948,1444,325,1759,3686,2747,316,454,1487,631,634,6701,316,544,264,1089,301,29915,262,20309,818,301,29915,29874,680,270,29915,348,289,627,29948,4336,2070,29948,19971,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,1444,2453,1314,4880,261,2257,439,29915,309,409,21714,13019,29889,20513,277,327,309,818,301,29915,262,20309,29892,439,29915,1808,707,872,1841,572,291,29883,326,9407,29892,5646,7015,21880,325,609,19172,276,316,1437,29882,5171,454,4464,316,18165,17239,316,425,289,627,29948,634,2070,29948,19971,1465,443,3184,270,29915,3610,1690,3039,634,270,29915,1062,2390,514,362,270,29915,12352,300,14255,301,29915,21708,29889,1720,707,1436,29948,29892,2257,455,707,1671,541,316,21933,546,818,26610,966,325,1064,2470,6367,944,7147,427,282,1893,819,1044,27751,425,16987,782,454,8575,29948,316,13164,10283,293,1166,818,2967,316,289,627,4894,9364,1647,29889,838,943,29892,707,29899,346,712,29871,4277,7890,2181,271,434,15237,29973,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,322,24233,1230,7014,1048,773,289,5761,423,304,7539,10267,2129,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,896,508,376,1100,631,29908,385,297,20309,322,1584,2125,372,373,6053,304,1371,2693,263,716,13589,362,338,3755,11158,5526,292,29889,2398,29892,1728,4340,8252,470,10757,29892,372,338,5189,304,8072,2274,920,445,723,664,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,1009,2948,1033,19998,3275,304,263,2867,20678,297,8004,278,7208,12903,310,17135,22713,322,14502,338,626,2966,2738,29892,541,1122,367,18066,292,304,6176,1728,901,18387,848,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,24084,2710,278,7037,5161,2039,6942,411,1009,2948,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,13173,7418,310,1438,5161,2039,470,920,896,723,367,1380,335,630,29889,910,10225,310,19220,363,7037,4216,1627,29879,26830,278,20408,294,20193,310,1009,2980,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,7014,526,8031,322,7088,3902,8253,4340,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,304,1207,263,23505,1206,363,1009,7972,2948,29889],"total_duration":53418169021,"load_duration":171362,"prompt_eval_count":250,"prompt_eval_duration":20874486000,"eval_count":268,"eval_duration":32542754000}
