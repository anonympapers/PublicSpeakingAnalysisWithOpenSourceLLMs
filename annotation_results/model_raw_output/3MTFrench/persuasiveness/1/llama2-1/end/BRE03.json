{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T11:11:38.230666153Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"Il faut...\", \"il que fait...\") and parallelism (\"des ann√©es lies sur un outil similaire en laboratoire\") to emphasize their points and make the message more convincing. They also use vivid imagery, such as the comparison of the code barre to a photo of the environment in which the rock was formed, to help illustrate their arguments.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a claim about the uniqueness of each code barre without providing any evidence or explanation for why they believe this to be the case. Additionally, the speaker's assertion that the works of the young octorate were \"inestimable\" could be supported by more specific examples or details.\n\nOverall, while the speech is well-delivered and effectively conveys the speaker's enthusiasm for their work, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,21668,454,8714,316,2723,17387,24618,5059,1318,29892,454,286,3610,927,707,1437,1003,29948,14426,273,15471,1671,16219,381,316,425,301,29915,1351,13901,29878,6832,1318,29889,1720,712,16623,1249,13547,454,5535,427,9460,29889,1720,21668,4048,6390,439,29915,1808,302,29915,342,2331,1067,283,1318,29231,5495,1671,454,17043,5582,2123,425,8281,29874,11076,29889,8748,1354,7890,1072,19755,29920,1190,26814,29262,29892,7890,16391,29920,443,1473,337,7451,29892,1841,345,1924,13545,8595,2298,11364,1190,16852,29889,2664,25902,316,5278,288,2801,1647,15777,8288,938,326,882,619,743,818,5278,10655,805,271,4379,29889,8748,2257,337,7451,3119,2487,1249,316,13164,13267,29875,29889,838,943,29892,1067,283,29948,2535,7015,904,13775,453,787,29892,2779,27478,553,8595,12185,1190,443,714,309,1027,4233,533,427,10212,20141,1671,302,29915,424,21216,1597,29835,316,775,2594,276,29889,8748,2257,775,2594,276,29892,5695,5469,6683,9549,29892,6303,5412,1671,18402,904,13775,12794,29889,16579,802,12608,6303,4191,1597,15373,316,301,29915,21813,17239,1465,27612,274,29915,14386,883,29948,425,696,1173,427,2600,13469,332,29889,12390,11561,2594,690,4625,27299,610,425,9460,316,5734,8376,2535,872,1082,16219,434,1190,16852,29889,2664,25902,316,5278,17222,288,2801,1647,8556,4625,3635,275,316,6628,1314,7199,9030,22572,29915,15669,454,21423,1700,3068,1387,3760,819,29889,8748,8556,1671,29878,1080,29892,8556,2852,355,787,13260,8501,1190,425,9460,553,25902,297,342,326,1849,316,1067,283,1318,29889,2191,592,5246,4048,6390,712,425,6283,1318,260,29915,29874,4224,3381,316,27441,1524,7890,14333,29889,2581,7890,3669,2350,568,443,15129,17775,634,818,289,993,9373,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,4852,14126,21668,856,613,376,309,712,5246,856,1159,322,8943,1608,4852,2783,8595,12185,1190,443,714,309,1027,4233,533,427,10212,20141,1159,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,1207,278,2643,901,17953,3277,29889,2688,884,671,325,3640,6382,708,29892,1316,408,278,10230,310,278,775,2594,276,304,263,15373,310,278,5177,297,607,278,7679,471,8429,29892,304,1371,28475,1009,6273,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,1048,278,20498,18543,310,1269,775,2594,276,1728,13138,738,10757,470,8252,363,2020,896,4658,445,304,367,278,1206,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,278,1736,310,278,4123,288,2801,403,892,376,262,342,326,519,29908,1033,367,6969,491,901,2702,6455,470,4902,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,338,1532,29899,6144,2147,287,322,17583,378,345,952,278,25657,29915,29879,23644,3173,29885,363,1009,664,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,29889],"total_duration":63504843246,"load_duration":155740,"prompt_eval_count":332,"prompt_eval_duration":30748856000,"eval_count":257,"eval_duration":32755441000}
