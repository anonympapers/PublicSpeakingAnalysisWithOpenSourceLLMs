{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T09:06:53.065490988Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and metaphors to convey their message, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker's use of vivid imagery and metaphors helps to create a sense of urgency and importance around the issue of the loss of portals. The repetition of key phrases such as \"portes perdus\" and \"merilladaine\" serves to emphasize the speaker's message and make it more memorable for the audience.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a claim that the construction of portals is increasing due to the passage of time without providing any evidence or data to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's argument that the loss of portals leads to a premature aging of the world and its inhabitants could be more nuanced and better supported by scientific evidence.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's use of rhetorical devices is effective in conveying their message, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6340,409,8323,316,425,14710,17449,316,301,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,25681,9061,29920,29899,4346,29875,443,17887,14426,634,7890,269,29915,2749,787,7015,4239,15159,414,21592,7862,2535,8570,29889,997,10135,14090,1841,29873,293,1297,14738,634,425,20757,590,1552,282,898,29878,1318,29889,8526,301,29915,524,14508,316,7015,4239,21592,7862,29892,553,28074,7545,22235,743,17137,409,8323,316,6267,18165,17239,29889,8748,7015,28074,7545,22235,743,17137,3435,20081,634,22458,5475,29892,1209,424,270,29915,348,21592,2073,818,301,29915,18288,427,18165,553,3008,29877,1144,316,425,3038,1297,6316,29889,315,29915,342,8288,712,7890,302,29915,29874,545,29920,2331,316,425,29845,1597,22577,14931,1190,425,10135,14090,1841,29873,293,1297,14738,634,5278,22577,14931,443,9122,29889,8748,29871,4277,5246,301,29915,29882,1478,1064,311,29884,634,14924,425,26558,553,28074,7545,22235,743,17137,29889,2598,13659,316,1243,270,29915,332,1171,15647,1189,2488,3503,427,10019,5084,439,29915,1351,29883,454,8714,29892,425,2778,453,1114,457,427,18332,425,7632,316,2298,427,2298,316,7015,2011,7719,11113,375,29889,7747,1750,263,1671,1136,29948,3068,29883,1597,29835,634,4158,361,553,19612,26536,634,15835,398,316,425,10135,14090,1841,29873,293,1297,14738,29892,409,5695,409,8265,1760,7771,782,19666,316,425,20757,590,1552,282,898,29878,1318,29889,1174,7945,424,443,289,3222,265,270,29915,647,3409,1934,29871,29896,29945,714,2167,1190,285,1485,344,29892,443,18085,3409,1934,29871,29896,29945,714,2167,1190,5227,7214,610,17488,29889,10016,1190,305,28411,29948,1089,29887,19971,1224,1487,1373,29876,5249,634,443,6316,453,11537,544,2249,1337,29948,316,425,3038,1297,29889,951,17775,316,286,532,895,269,29915,2749,9061,29871,1654,427,289,999,17161,29948,7209,875,9061,29892,274,29915,342,8164,29899,5474,2331,270,29915,2251,6311,1597,14931,1750,260,29915,29874,11113,434,29892,1750,707,425,1067,29948,1671,7199,9030,443,1374,1690,290,8146,29892,18679,4191,454,9122,29892,432,29915,1794,443,14738,634,454,6316,453,11537,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,1539,12451,943,304,27769,1009,2643,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,1539,12451,943,6911,304,1653,263,4060,310,5065,14703,322,13500,2820,278,2228,310,278,6410,310,2011,1338,29889,450,21159,654,310,1820,12216,2129,1316,408,376,637,267,11113,375,29908,322,376,1050,453,1114,457,29908,19700,304,19310,675,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,322,1207,372,901,26959,519,363,278,20026,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,393,278,7632,310,2011,1338,338,10231,2861,304,278,13382,310,931,1728,13138,738,10757,470,848,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,6410,310,2011,1338,11981,304,263,5188,1535,946,292,310,278,3186,322,967,19681,1033,367,901,4948,8362,322,2253,6969,491,16021,10757,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,338,11828,297,378,345,5414,1009,2643,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,10757,29889],"total_duration":73499321112,"load_duration":259107,"prompt_eval_count":405,"prompt_eval_duration":37797420000,"eval_count":274,"eval_duration":35701198000}
