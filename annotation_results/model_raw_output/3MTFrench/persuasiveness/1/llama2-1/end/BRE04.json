{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T11:00:52.955979932Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 4 out of 5 on the persuasiveness scale. The speaker does an effective job of presenting their research and using clear and concise language to explain complex concepts. They provide concrete examples and use visual aids to help illustrate their points, making it easier for the audience to understand and appreciate the significance of their findings.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the speaker could improve to make their message even more persuasive:\n\n1. Emotional appeal: While the speaker does provide some emotional language (e.g., \"il me faudra plus de 180 secondes pour tout vous rassurer\"), they could benefit from incorporating more emotional appeals to make their message more compelling and memorable.\n2. Storytelling: The speaker could use storytelling techniques to make their message more relatable and engaging for the audience. By weaving a narrative around their research, they could help the audience connect with the topic on a deeper level and become more invested in the outcome of the study.\n3. Call to action: While the speaker does provide some information about the potential impact of their research, they could benefit from including a clear call to action at the end of their presentation. This would give the audience a sense of purpose and encourage them to take action based on the information presented.\n\nOverall, the speaker does an excellent job of presenting their research in a clear and concise manner, but could benefit from incorporating more emotional appeals and storytelling techniques to make their message even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,427,2298,29892,29871,4277,2665,454,285,681,29899,29891,634,4556,553,5394,29888,1973,29889,8396,29926,473,29892,301,29915,1117,8837,29889,9353,454,7017,4274,29892,454,9638,22781,712,1444,26099,427,7945,270,29915,29948,699,276,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,375,1039,818,4323,3709,425,4613,12232,316,1939,264,1460,634,818,7774,1946,631,1487,12471,17239,20674,1387,427,4239,13391,29889,29387,424,712,1939,264,1460,29892,8288,712,7015,3533,4285,316,5227,275,18475,441,29879,3435,15390,316,1136,290,1050,425,22777,270,29915,1690,277,10492,640,4814,1465,454,269,2487,2073,868,285,2955,29889,383,1759,787,8288,316,1939,264,1460,29892,1597,20319,17799,29899,513,8105,17417,270,29915,1344,13805,364,4070,29899,264,277,10492,634,285,1794,569,427,288,3594,29887,8146,29889,5670,29889,11948,818,4556,818,724,276,316,4048,6390,29871,4277,29892,1436,6311,29889,8748,6079,7890,316,13325,4048,6390,712,29892,4239,16283,29892,3058,267,20542,316,454,7019,749,3435,427,7945,316,269,29915,9961,369,427,288,3594,29887,8146,818,4556,316,7814,5039,7719,3165,13116,29889,8748,6079,2852,566,819,966,363,1179,626,647,10270,270,29915,1690,277,29878,6832,424,29892,4555,1939,264,1460,14924,316,10252,276,1190,454,1472,20689,301,29915,29948,4068,316,7015,20542,29892,634,18332,443,2730,11771,1671,7199,9030,634,544,2487,381,966,10879,29879,1190,454,18165,17239,553,904,3944,858,19503,1766,1144,29889,11948,18916,29892,980,592,2258,566,336,2298,316,29871,29896,29947,29900,1473,267,1671,5646,7890,364,465,9945,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,6287,29889,450,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,2198,292,1009,5925,322,773,2821,322,3022,895,4086,304,5649,4280,22001,29889,2688,3867,18387,6455,322,671,7604,263,4841,304,1371,28475,1009,3291,29892,3907,372,6775,363,278,20026,304,2274,322,11188,278,26002,310,1009,1284,886,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,263,2846,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,1584,901,20408,294,573,29901,13,13,29896,29889,2812,327,1848,25530,29901,5806,278,25657,947,3867,777,23023,1848,4086,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,309,592,2258,566,336,2298,316,29871,29896,29947,29900,1473,267,1671,5646,7890,364,465,9945,4968,896,1033,14169,515,11039,1218,901,23023,1848,5929,1338,304,1207,1009,2643,901,752,7807,322,26959,519,29889,13,29906,29889,13740,29873,7807,29901,450,25657,1033,671,5828,29873,7807,13698,304,1207,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,322,3033,6751,363,278,20026,29889,2648,591,5555,263,15474,1230,2820,1009,5925,29892,896,1033,1371,278,20026,4511,411,278,11261,373,263,25871,3233,322,4953,901,2437,2868,297,278,21957,310,278,6559,29889,13,29941,29889,8251,304,3158,29901,5806,278,25657,947,3867,777,2472,1048,278,7037,10879,310,1009,5925,29892,896,1033,14169,515,3704,263,2821,1246,304,3158,472,278,1095,310,1009,24329,29889,910,723,2367,278,20026,263,4060,310,6437,322,13731,6617,963,304,2125,3158,2729,373,278,2472,9132,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,947,385,15129,4982,310,2198,292,1009,5925,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,1033,14169,515,11039,1218,901,23023,1848,5929,1338,322,5828,29873,7807,13698,304,1207,1009,2643,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":73782256122,"load_duration":156229,"prompt_eval_count":308,"prompt_eval_duration":28592111000,"eval_count":348,"eval_duration":45189611000}
