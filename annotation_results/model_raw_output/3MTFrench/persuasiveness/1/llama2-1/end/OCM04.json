{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:14:06.447633971Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker does make some convincing arguments, such as the importance of identifying and analyzing cells to determine the most effective treatment options. However, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened. For example, the speaker mentions that the machine they are using can aspire cells and pass them through a laser, but they do not provide enough details about how this process works or why it is necessary for identifying cell identity.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker does provide some logical connections between their claims and evidence, such as the importance of analyzing cells to determine treatment options. However, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker mentions that they have \"recupéré les organes,\" but they do not provide any details about how they were able to recover these organs or what methods they used.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does make some convincing arguments, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,997,364,10870,25810,4191,1597,269,3498,270,29915,1131,2016,10042,316,19136,19844,966,2894,267,11482,2344,573,4191,454,7446,29885,585,634,454,1701,347,29889,838,943,16134,424,29892,1444,872,275,6722,11797,3435,29892,274,29915,342,6079,367,585,29892,3503,1444,872,275,610,346,439,29915,2719,4625,1465,454,9712,276,1671,6628,1314,301,6463,8474,29889,2581,1841,5231,1908,966,2894,267,29892,1444,544,3610,15792,7015,2894,267,29892,1444,872,275,2331,966,3038,2540,966,1597,553,10890,29892,634,432,29915,1794,5246,27962,1465,443,1354,29899,15135,30000,2484,427,20501,29889,10793,4933,29892,7051,533,966,3038,2540,634,966,5246,27962,966,1597,7907,966,10890,19398,443,1869,261,29889,315,3100,2453,329,592,19172,276,316,1841,5231,29539,23422,966,3038,2540,24241,1671,966,3483,952,267,29889,12390,3483,952,267,3435,13901,2122,29892,1559,11797,325,609,19172,276,316,17043,13639,966,3038,2540,634,10714,261,1597,20206,2893,2131,29889,12390,10256,4285,4625,4370,325,609,19172,276,316,3060,275,381,782,6628,1314,966,1020,667,1237,29892,1559,1444,29758,16794,29892,443,1020,17334,2852,6366,815,29892,1354,634,23422,1354,29892,980,707,3060,10770,427,18165,553,3038,2540,439,29915,264,269,29915,342,28280,29889,838,943,1444,286,29915,4582,1509,8164,29899,5474,270,29915,28619,2504,29948,1117,8837,29892,3503,286,29915,29874,1241,29874,4883,274,13805,29889,435,29915,9983,1908,712,2257,12852,29892,1444,7890,7468,2654,3409,29948,443,7006,270,29915,9983,29948,11115,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,947,1207,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,1316,408,278,13500,310,2893,9215,322,29537,292,9101,304,8161,278,1556,11828,14502,3987,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,278,4933,896,526,773,508,7051,533,9101,322,1209,963,1549,263,1869,261,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,3307,4902,1048,920,445,1889,1736,470,2020,372,338,5181,363,2893,9215,3038,10110,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,947,3867,777,16667,12368,1546,1009,16726,322,10757,29892,1316,408,278,13500,310,29537,292,9101,304,8161,14502,3987,29889,2398,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,505,376,3757,786,16555,966,2894,267,1699,541,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,1048,920,896,892,2221,304,9792,1438,1638,550,470,825,3519,896,1304,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,1207,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":59447459936,"load_duration":306585,"prompt_eval_count":299,"prompt_eval_duration":26925479000,"eval_count":259,"eval_duration":32521182000}
