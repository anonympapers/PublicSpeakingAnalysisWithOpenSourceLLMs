{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T09:05:39.552934983Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness. The speaker presents some interesting observations and ideas, but there are also some notable flaws in their reasoning and presentation.\n\nFirstly, the speaker seems to be making some sweeping generalizations about the effects of a particular \"superprotein\" on muscle cells without providing sufficient scientific evidence to support their claims. While they mention some studies and research, they fail to provide any specific data or experiments that demonstrate the protein's effectiveness in preventing muscle degeneration. This lack of empirical evidence undermines the speaker's argument and makes it difficult to take their claims seriously.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's reasoning is not always rigorous. For example, they claim that the formation of \"amens\" (a term that is not defined in the transcript) is a sign of muscle degeneration, but they do not provide any explanation as to why this would occur. Additionally, their assertion that the protein can \"regroup\" noyaux (also not defined) and restore muscle function is not supported by any scientific evidence.\n\nFinally, the speaker's use of language and tone is not particularly persuasive. They use vague terms like \"bon\" and \"d√©saccord\" without providing any context or explanation, which can make their arguments feel arbitrary and unconvincing.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some interesting ideas, their lack of scientific evidence and rigorous reasoning undermines their persuasiveness. A score of 3 out of 5 is appropriate for this transcript.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,10814,427,5646,3209,1354,373,24722,2970,5278,2428,14676,262,316,7814,3038,2540,2301,1810,7147,373,14111,553,26379,11482,1300,29879,1465,7814,2301,1810,7147,634,25763,5646,2257,712,432,29915,1794,4880,29948,432,29915,1794,2653,8689,712,966,694,29891,2993,316,7015,3038,2540,409,337,629,6648,1671,4642,553,626,575,966,694,29891,2993,2257,3435,443,7006,966,1841,3146,1912,1750,4313,12161,454,18165,17239,316,14984,7814,3038,2540,270,29915,7308,4279,11797,3435,610,5444,17334,7595,743,3503,18916,18097,373,6282,484,24145,2428,14676,262,10814,553,26379,626,575,634,29871,4277,966,2301,1810,743,6701,2331,9201,274,29915,342,270,29915,8284,1295,443,11482,1300,439,29915,265,8164,22944,1465,966,3038,2540,2301,1810,7147,553,18554,9577,19406,29887,2406,373,623,1808,29871,4277,425,269,29915,5666,459,1690,347,1465,443,432,5022,634,29871,4277,5246,553,7067,29879,1841,29881,2445,1446,373,1437,8366,802,454,22964,918,553,11101,7719,2301,1810,7147,634,626,575,694,29891,2993,1601,6836,3104,5340,1044,2491,634,712,1354,373,16380,479,316,5278,2428,14676,262,1465,966,3038,2540,2301,1810,7147,316,7814,904,1056,275,8532,6267,694,29891,2993,1791,1572,373,610,5444,17334,7595,29948,18916,289,20191,1436,423,425,18234,316,29578,568,3503,29871,4277,21668,29899,309,10440,454,544,8885,634,2123,29875,6079,9947,1465,425,23520,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,13917,322,7014,29892,541,727,526,884,777,18697,17422,5652,297,1009,24481,322,24329,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,2444,304,367,3907,777,7901,26819,2498,17063,1048,278,9545,310,263,3153,376,9136,14676,262,29908,373,2301,2841,9101,1728,13138,8002,16021,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,5806,896,3585,777,11898,322,5925,29892,896,4418,304,3867,738,2702,848,470,15729,393,22222,278,26823,29915,29879,2779,20193,297,5557,292,2301,2841,3587,759,362,29889,910,10225,310,29190,936,10757,563,837,1475,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,322,3732,372,5189,304,2125,1009,16726,25798,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,278,12409,310,376,314,575,29908,313,29874,1840,393,338,451,3342,297,278,1301,924,29897,338,263,1804,310,2301,2841,3587,759,362,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,8252,408,304,2020,445,723,6403,29889,19814,29892,1009,28306,393,278,26823,508,376,276,2972,29908,694,29891,2993,313,15189,451,3342,29897,322,17749,2301,2841,740,338,451,6969,491,738,16021,10757,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,322,16225,338,451,10734,20408,294,573,29889,2688,671,25160,4958,763,376,6718,29908,322,376,29881,743,5753,536,29908,1728,13138,738,3030,470,8252,29892,607,508,1207,1009,6273,4459,11472,322,443,535,3845,3277,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,8031,7014,29892,1009,10225,310,16021,10757,322,12912,20657,24481,563,837,1475,1009,20408,294,20193,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,338,8210,363,445,1301,924,29889],"total_duration":70267335668,"load_duration":160352,"prompt_eval_count":273,"prompt_eval_duration":25191325000,"eval_count":353,"eval_duration":45075462000}
