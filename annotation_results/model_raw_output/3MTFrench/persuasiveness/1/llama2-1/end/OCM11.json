{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:02:09.033687067Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and imagery to convey their message and create an emotional response in the audience. The use of metaphors and similes adds depth and complexity to the speech, making it more engaging and persuasive.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is also rigorous, as they provide examples and evidence to support their argument. However, there are some areas where the logic could be improved, such as when the speaker mentions \"ces hommes-l√† ils ne sont pas vraiment mort,\" which could be clarified or expanded upon for greater effectiveness.\n\nOverall, the transcript demonstrates a high level of persuasive ability and effective use of language, but with some room for improvement in terms of logical consistency.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,7890,454,992,4099,29920,2257,15142,29892,19601,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,454,1506,7608,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,1083,13974,2265,454,15142,610,553,286,1862,634,9411,966,286,1862,1750,592,286,29915,29874,953,29885,759,818,301,29915,487,1924,29892,9411,966,286,1862,712,1444,301,275,1465,7015,6017,550,29892,432,29915,1794,8829,347,316,966,17161,261,270,29915,24430,427,19601,634,18158,316,7890,966,9073,760,482,1314,29889,12390,17137,29899,27048,11797,452,3435,2331,325,336,2073,5758,29892,11797,1863,296,29892,11797,3435,1465,24145,19696,371,29892,11797,3435,1465,966,13349,29877,647,1179,29892,11797,3435,1465,9411,966,286,1862,439,29915,2719,4625,301,29915,404,2747,29892,3503,8570,29892,14877,309,749,29892,7015,26893,3435,17573,743,337,15470,7209,712,26744,452,269,29915,264,29271,6102,27649,29892,634,8532,29871,4277,25810,3817,15471,2257,10708,316,3814,29892,1506,275,424,5278,904,16398,1082,29899,27761,29892,18729,707,1437,695,1318,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,6382,708,304,27769,1009,2643,322,1653,385,23023,1848,2933,297,278,20026,29889,450,671,310,1539,12451,943,322,1027,5475,12778,10809,322,13644,304,278,12032,29892,3907,372,901,3033,6751,322,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,884,12912,20657,29892,408,896,3867,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,2980,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,5900,1033,367,16710,29892,1316,408,746,278,25657,26649,376,778,17137,29899,27048,11797,452,3435,2331,325,336,2073,5758,1699,607,1033,367,7542,2164,470,17832,2501,363,7621,2779,20193,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,1301,924,9004,1078,263,1880,3233,310,20408,294,573,11509,322,11828,671,310,4086,29892,541,411,777,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,16667,5718,3819,29889],"total_duration":42347269013,"load_duration":140459,"prompt_eval_count":198,"prompt_eval_duration":17898182000,"eval_count":190,"eval_duration":24448523000}
