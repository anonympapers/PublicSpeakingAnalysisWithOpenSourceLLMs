The speaker presents their idea in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker starts by establishing their credibility as a musician, which helps to build trust with the audience. However, the argument could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how the melody and rhythm of the music can evoke emotions and transport listeners to different places. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claim that listening to music at a distance can help people forget their troubles and find peace.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a intriguing idea, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by more concrete examples.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,838,943,29892,980,343,263,1487,270,2663,868,9668,1705,13545,24590,1446,782,29889,5879,568,818,17887,29892,432,29915,1794,6787,277,443,301,30000,29916,1387,1750,18332,425,3928,749,2637,966,11486,316,15188,634,966,12694,1237,325,5326,29889,341,1540,573,29899,280,5278,1067,29948,29892,1444,325,2736,23469,16134,424,9073,301,29915,262,3901,29889,10793,10098,29892,1444,17043,275,425,286,3610,397,347,634,1444,14954,1173,454,2123,966,10814,29894,1934,29889,6803,19397,8288,17789,582,533,29892,301,29915,271,7681,561,1908,634,425,11492,553,325,1237,1437,9018,21017,29892,818,5418,634,1027,2037,427,966,904,13147,424,29889,319,4889,316,9364,276,443,364,1541,1004,634,3005,17856,29892,373,25921,610,452,2298,8689,29892,11113,434,29892,634,704,4926,966,521,15806,1027,2701,634,818,301,29915,262,845,261,2265,29892,15237,2298,752,492,17851,634,409,285,14194,7808,29889,8748,1671,29873,424,29892,18484,29892,373,302,29915,29874,2331,3008,28230,316,21394,1671,12278,1875,29889,1720,8556,9378,277,8164,29899,5474,925,29872,316,26610,425,17949,29892,316,2174,2265,966,26809,634,270,29915,4582,5561,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,8665,491,10127,292,1009,6625,4127,408,263,4696,713,29892,607,6911,304,2048,9311,411,278,20026,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,13138,901,2702,6455,310,920,278,9232,1486,322,18178,29265,310,278,4696,508,321,5744,23023,1080,322,8608,11621,414,304,1422,7600,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,19866,304,4696,472,263,5418,508,1371,2305,9566,1009,18835,322,1284,10776,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,11158,5526,292,2969,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,901,18387,6455,29889],"total_duration":43831798154,"load_duration":234965,"prompt_eval_count":228,"prompt_eval_duration":20910627000,"eval_count":179,"eval_duration":22920387000}
