The speaker presents their research in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of explaining their research methodology and the results they have obtained through simulation and analysis. They provide a clear and detailed description of their approach, including the use of computer simulations to model the propagation of cancer and the mousse d'ose. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker does not provide a thorough explanation of why they chose to use specific rules for assembling the structures, or why they believe that their simulation results will accurately reflect real-world conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could benefit from providing more context and background information on the topic of cancer and its development. While they mention that their research is focused on understanding the mechanisms of cancer development, they do not provide any information on the current state of knowledge on this topic or how their research fits into the broader field of cancer research. Providing more context and background information could help to make the speaker's argument more persuasive and increase the audience's understanding of the significance of their research.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their research in a clear and concise manner, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the presentation could be improved by providing more context and background information.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,553,260,294,316,14984,5697,1169,27219,2993,1671,3686,2747,316,1437,18821,261,425,15259,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,316,301,29915,852,29892,3503,1750,707,659,424,316,425,286,585,1564,895,29452,316,274,2073,29889,6803,301,29915,7614,5313,1973,29892,274,29915,342,2298,1411,29889,315,29915,342,4191,553,274,743,634,316,5663,8885,966,13900,316,7632,270,29915,11576,1849,29892,623,2200,681,21181,18097,301,29915,26739,424,29889,838,943,270,29915,1540,760,29892,432,29915,1794,3984,782,1298,443,19607,316,17402,1190,22420,7289,1750,2947,14954,4630,818,9483,533,425,13089,362,316,2257,23900,634,316,872,286,681,344,270,29915,852,29892,21181,439,29915,1351,29883,553,27264,793,270,29915,465,1590,6184,2560,29889,8748,316,301,29915,18288,29892,432,29915,1794,3984,782,1298,443,553,1824,4467,270,29915,7054,952,267,316,3829,712,1444,325,1759,623,492,7808,5695,6079,818,4883,6896,19718,316,17402,29892,18097,4883,904,13775,453,787,29889,6101,966,4239,592,14735,296,454,6701,6896,499,271,29892,289,20191,29892,373,4082,277,883,1297,634,373,872,277,2123,3581,546,454,24305,29889,11948,5646,29871,4277,302,29915,264,707,10440,13222,29889,8748,1601,18848,29892,274,29915,342,316,13942,29877,2496,7015,1824,4467,818,17103,316,1243,270,29915,7054,952,267,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,1671,9073,784,1358,21285,29892,22259,2131,634,17402,29892,634,439,29915,30001,8694,21285,29892,8556,2653,790,787,15722,1037,2257,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,5925,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,24232,1009,5925,1158,3002,322,278,2582,896,505,7625,1549,17402,322,7418,29889,2688,3867,263,2821,322,13173,6139,310,1009,2948,29892,3704,278,671,310,6601,23876,304,1904,278,13089,362,310,23900,322,278,286,681,344,270,29915,852,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,263,17826,8252,310,2020,896,12784,304,671,2702,6865,363,24367,1847,278,12286,29892,470,2020,896,4658,393,1009,17402,2582,674,7913,2486,9432,1855,29899,11526,5855,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,14169,515,13138,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,23900,322,967,5849,29889,5806,896,3585,393,1009,5925,338,21309,373,8004,278,7208,12903,310,23900,5849,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2472,373,278,1857,2106,310,7134,373,445,11261,470,920,1009,5925,23994,964,278,2545,1664,1746,310,23900,5925,29889,9133,4821,901,3030,322,3239,2472,1033,1371,304,1207,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,901,20408,294,573,322,7910,278,20026,29915,29879,8004,310,278,26002,310,1009,5925,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,5925,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,24329,1033,367,16710,491,13138,901,3030,322,3239,2472,29889],"total_duration":68299414279,"load_duration":225678,"prompt_eval_count":295,"prompt_eval_duration":27272685000,"eval_count":321,"eval_duration":41023127000}
