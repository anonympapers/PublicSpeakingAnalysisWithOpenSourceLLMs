{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T11:12:37.33384887Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker presents a convincing argument that the traditional view of governance is no longer relevant in today's world. They argue that the Etat has been replaced by a diversity of actors, including civil society organizations, multinational corporations, and even individuals. This argument is well-supported by examples and evidence, such as the recognition of the US government's role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. However, the speaker could have gone further in explaining how this shift in governance will benefit society as a whole.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker uses logical reasoning to make their case, but there are some areas where their argument could be strengthened. For example, they could have provided more concrete examples of how the diversity of actors will lead to better decision-making and problem-solving. Additionally, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or criticisms of their view on governance.\n\nOverall, while the speech presents a compelling argument, there are areas where it could be improved in terms of persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,8997,454,13222,553,8595,29871,29896,29929,29947,29900,29892,553,8478,7719,1887,267,6701,553,8820,270,29915,328,29948,1830,358,634,610,6267,1518,4894,663,29892,634,6267,1518,1064,2938,20554,409,3435,7275,2406,4191,553,1044,11620,10918,277,1355,316,7015,24305,29889,8407,1298,6701,18097,29871,29906,29900,29900,29945,29892,966,5233,29899,11604,25238,790,10978,10713,364,30069,793,4191,7618,1455,267,1671,21609,19844,966,1203,10270,868,3533,29948,15421,1671,454,24305,29889,23719,1039,29892,9811,342,269,29915,1144,9695,1465,443,1139,21941,21394,2298,2919,316,2257,712,8556,9411,6382,262,787,316,425,15306,749,14475,634,6701,425,15306,749,316,7814,9744,29889,317,4745,1314,29899,29876,681,2779,19882,1209,743,1465,1597,13752,17449,316,2373,29948,29889,8526,301,29915,3027,270,29915,1540,6894,2131,270,29915,627,11620,29892,8556,17078,1080,925,882,270,29915,1540,6894,2131,270,29915,348,4595,819,29892,7209,1671,1120,424,427,11113,276,4021,2131,634,427,748,7425,29889,8748,868,10814,2373,29948,29892,1444,1236,1314,7890,2970,29892,432,29915,264,7468,25016,29948,29889,4360,344,29892,274,29915,342,10814,712,553,3516,21158,29889,838,943,29892,1671,4048,6390,1354,301,29915,29923,8101,18062,454,1539,2484,297,1285,342,29948,868,9122,29892,19643,29920,29899,23088,818,611,13267,264,749,1465,443,385,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,263,17953,3277,2980,393,278,13807,1776,310,4095,749,338,694,5520,8018,297,9826,29915,29879,3186,29889,2688,27754,393,278,382,8101,756,1063,8611,491,263,6894,537,310,29701,29892,3704,7631,12459,25700,29892,1773,262,1288,17266,800,29892,322,1584,15724,29889,910,2980,338,1532,29899,23765,491,6455,322,10757,29892,1316,408,278,19679,310,278,3148,5874,29915,29879,6297,297,3657,15387,278,8649,264,1240,398,14650,2921,1338,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,1033,505,7695,4340,297,24232,920,445,9500,297,4095,749,674,14169,12459,408,263,3353,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,3913,16667,24481,304,1207,1009,1206,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,4944,901,18387,6455,310,920,278,6894,537,310,29701,674,3275,304,2253,10608,29899,28990,322,1108,29899,2929,1747,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,11164,12903,310,1009,1776,373,4095,749,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,22981,263,752,7807,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,372,1033,367,16710,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889],"total_duration":59089438079,"load_duration":205783,"prompt_eval_count":267,"prompt_eval_duration":24403298000,"eval_count":275,"eval_duration":34685401000}
