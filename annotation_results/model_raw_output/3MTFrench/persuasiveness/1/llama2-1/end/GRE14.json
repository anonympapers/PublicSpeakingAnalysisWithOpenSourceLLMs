{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T07:17:47.506477479Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. Persuasiveness: The speaker presents their findings in a clear and concise manner, using technical terms and jargon relevant to their field of study. They also provide examples and data to support their claims, which helps to build credibility and conviction. However, the speech lacks a clear call to action or a compelling argument for why their research is important or groundbreaking. A higher score would be warranted if the speaker had presented a more compelling case for why their research matters.\n2. Rigorous reasoning: The speaker appears to have a good understanding of their field and the data they are presenting. They provide statistical analysis and visualizations to support their claims, which shows a good grasp of the subject matter. However, some of the reasoning could be more rigorous, such as providing more detailed explanations of the statistical tests they used or the assumptions that underlie their conclusions. A higher score would be warranted if the speaker had provided more detailed and nuanced reasoning.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their findings in a clear and concise manner, there is room for improvement in terms of presenting a more compelling argument and providing more rigorous reasoning to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,435,29915,404,15802,1671,8689,1354,29871,4277,18165,484,29889,2581,3667,895,1597,325,336,347,3965,29874,3803,352,1318,21136,1808,29892,634,1671,12694,1237,4768,290,5793,29892,1444,16623,1197,29948,29889,997,7175,862,362,553,1775,29038,29892,454,1841,3820,482,316,611,4933,29892,634,1444,29188,425,4021,2131,553,3803,352,2406,29892,634,454,10814,18165,17239,316,1601,1889,29889,1720,343,263,2535,14984,7015,21880,29892,7890,4078,29920,2257,712,1444,1236,1314,9073,29889,2726,12997,3783,29892,432,29915,1794,270,29915,296,361,3955,619,264,2637,966,883,267,634,966,3581,280,1295,316,4883,4768,290,5793,29892,634,966,1841,3820,1179,712,1444,19760,3667,7608,1671,16219,381,553,3803,352,2406,1750,364,3906,2258,455,944,1465,1601,3710,9552,29889,29871,30219,29874,1766,1173,28185,9373,2331,4439,29889,2581,2906,23469,5178,5495,818,301,29915,283,275,868,28643,966,12997,3783,29889,1459,17488,29892,432,29915,1794,1083,279,17851,712,454,1060,309,273,29892,443,553,5541,1934,3420,2993,316,4883,4768,290,5793,29892,634,5162,882,27760,3610,1318,2535,301,29915,14531,712,1444,19760,11039,261,1671,16219,381,553,3803,352,2406,6896,391,1934,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,2331,868,5646,544,1975,7252,7674,21136,1808,29889,6803,425,9460,316,611,266,17449,29892,432,29915,9983,1908,534,8885,270,29915,14559,992,583,270,29915,20640,4371,1671,712,301,29915,265,2653,5582,818,20689,29892,2258,455,944,3667,7608,14984,7015,13745,1279,3783,1750,8556,875,7771,29889,349,4664,802,274,29915,342,29871,4277,29892,454,3464,1314,29889,897,1601,1437,284,283,275,1750,7890,12468,1808,966,26809,29889,405,359,25698,19503,3435,7848,925,29872,1437,1324,1314,270,29915,23578,1934,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,2266,29915,29879,2020,29901,13,13,29896,29889,9034,29884,294,20193,29901,450,25657,22981,1009,1284,886,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,16905,4958,322,432,1191,265,8018,304,1009,1746,310,6559,29889,2688,884,3867,6455,322,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,6911,304,2048,6625,4127,322,7602,2463,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,425,4684,263,2821,1246,304,3158,470,263,752,7807,2980,363,2020,1009,5925,338,4100,470,5962,1030,5086,29889,319,6133,8158,723,367,1370,29878,9714,565,278,25657,750,9132,263,901,752,7807,1206,363,2020,1009,5925,13750,29889,13,29906,29889,390,335,20657,24481,29901,450,25657,5692,304,505,263,1781,8004,310,1009,1746,322,278,848,896,526,2198,292,29889,2688,3867,24148,7418,322,7604,17063,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,3697,263,1781,25274,310,278,4967,4383,29889,2398,29892,777,310,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29892,1316,408,13138,901,13173,7309,800,310,278,24148,6987,896,1304,470,278,20813,393,1090,3197,1009,21204,1080,29889,319,6133,8158,723,367,1370,29878,9714,565,278,25657,750,4944,901,13173,322,4948,8362,24481,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,1284,886,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,727,338,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,2198,292,263,901,752,7807,2980,322,13138,901,12912,20657,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":69537460168,"load_duration":148556,"prompt_eval_count":343,"prompt_eval_duration":31391853000,"eval_count":299,"eval_duration":38144930000}
