{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T21:26:19.411988731Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness in crafting a convincing message. The speaker provides some interesting insights into the perception of children towards a specific practice, but their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nThe speaker mentions that children have a different perspective on the world than adults and that they are capable of innovation within the home. However, there is no clear evidence presented to support these claims, and the argument remains somewhat vague. The speaker also uses some language that could be seen as hyperbolic or exaggerated, such as \"le monde rep√©tige juste compte\" (the world repeats itself just counts), which may detract from the overall persuasiveness of the message.\n\nTo improve the persuasiveness of the speech, the speaker could provide more concrete examples and evidence to support their claims. They could also address potential counterarguments or criticisms of their position, and provide a clearer roadmap for how to achieve the desired outcome of a more sustainable world. With some additional refinement and support, the speaker's message could be more effectively conveyed and persuasive to their audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,980,10628,277,316,454,9122,2923,29948,1745,358,553,16157,267,29889,1459,263,26231,29892,11797,3435,316,5162,2923,1792,270,29915,2559,586,362,782,2757,868,1701,7598,29889,478,681,301,29915,6698,26477,12866,7199,275,29892,301,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,634,316,7199,9030,425,639,1441,553,21038,818,301,29915,2445,538,316,5278,544,15819,29892,18934,270,29915,424,790,29875,546,634,270,29915,562,2388,18303,10713,29378,1558,787,20299,882,2122,29889,6803,2257,9073,29892,1444,1539,29879,301,29915,348,21285,270,29915,296,2267,819,2535,553,21038,316,29871,29953,818,29871,29906,6063,634,7907,966,11469,1301,9695,29892,7015,2637,2034,575,8556,14924,509,609,610,425,9460,316,1437,371,312,261,29889,2664,2114,11620,3435,269,14069,2406,29892,11643,1189,3783,634,9257,26020,589,9318,6267,1436,634,6267,17385,362,29889,838,943,1354,1444,16623,5646,29871,4277,29892,634,712,1444,3516,575,22572,29915,15669,1671,7890,454,1153,535,357,29892,274,29915,342,925,29872,1671,7890,2970,712,1671,1597,3814,12973,29892,20244,634,1411,519,454,9122,1634,1893,2231,925,29872,16731,29889,8748,1354,5278,1967,7890,610,15749,22572,29915,15669,289,15356,276,29892,766,29899,29879,275,13545,8595,29892,4875,7890,760,7848,818,5646,818,5246,4226,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,639,1441,310,4344,7113,263,2702,6944,29892,541,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,1576,25657,26649,393,4344,505,263,1422,18520,373,278,3186,1135,16157,29879,322,393,896,526,15390,310,24233,362,2629,278,3271,29889,2398,29892,727,338,694,2821,10757,9132,304,2304,1438,16726,29892,322,278,2980,9242,10579,25160,29889,450,25657,884,3913,777,4086,393,1033,367,3595,408,11266,2095,293,470,429,9921,630,29892,1316,408,376,280,9122,1634,1893,2231,925,29872,16731,29908,313,1552,3186,5565,1446,3528,925,18139,511,607,1122,1439,1461,515,278,12463,20408,294,20193,310,278,2643,29889,13,13,1762,11157,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,18387,6455,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2688,1033,884,3211,7037,6795,25699,470,11164,12903,310,1009,2602,29892,322,3867,263,26135,6520,1958,363,920,304,6176,278,7429,21957,310,263,901,15075,475,519,3186,29889,2973,777,5684,2143,262,882,322,2304,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,1033,367,901,17583,27769,287,322,20408,294,573,304,1009,20026,29889],"total_duration":55895630033,"load_duration":230478,"prompt_eval_count":254,"prompt_eval_duration":22895470000,"eval_count":261,"eval_duration":32997595000}
