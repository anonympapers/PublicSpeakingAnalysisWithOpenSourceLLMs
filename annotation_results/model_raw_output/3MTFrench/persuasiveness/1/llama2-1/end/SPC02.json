The speaker does provide some convincing arguments and evidence to support their claim that the immunotherapy treatment they are developing is effective in combating cancer. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and persuasive.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more detailed explanations of the scientific concepts and mechanisms involved in the immunotherapy treatment. While they mention that the treatment involves producing large numbers of intracellular proteins called int√©grines, they do not explain how these proteins work or why they are effective in combating cancer. Providing more technical details and explanations could help to build credibility and conviction in the speaker's argument.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have provided more context and evidence to support their claim that the treatment is effective for other types of cancer beyond plumage cancer. While they mention that the information they have gathered is also applicable to other cancers, they do not provide any specific examples or studies to support this claim. Providing more concrete evidence and examples could help to strengthen the speaker's argument and make it more persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments and evidence, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and persuasive to make the speech more effective in convincing the audience of the effectiveness of the immunotherapy treatment.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,1601,509,261,712,5278,18768,6635,2445,7661,27119,1249,818,1597,5190,1318,316,27188,3246,23662,15826,1465,301,29915,267,1052,1943,29889,1551,966,623,1808,634,301,29915,3888,455,415,29948,6896,1693,286,2249,14119,29889,6803,339,7768,301,29915,267,1052,1943,1577,1459,346,439,29915,2719,3435,20075,743,316,5697,3246,410,6772,1475,316,5697,1169,8182,305,10778,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,938,27083,457,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,3984,427,10019,5084,712,274,29915,14386,23068,818,7015,938,27083,1475,1750,409,6974,10978,818,269,29915,351,374,546,782,269,3610,29884,2003,4564,1064,895,1671,1597,10996,1437,509,29884,533,29889,12390,19313,29899,27048,29892,432,29915,1794,503,29966,29989,386,29989,29958,13375,3006,375,1671,454,23900,868,715,290,1004,29892,3503,20554,3435,325,23469,1671,270,29915,14559,508,22543,29889,951,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,29948,1915,1181,455,415,29948,6896,1693,286,2249,14119,3435,15237,9201,7006,20081,1190,454,28439,29889,315,29915,342,1671,29871,4277,712,22572,29915,15669,8556,13942,29877,4798,443,13164,1020,17334,29892,1597,5198,348,1228,481,347,1671,966,1391,275,427,4595,5419,29889,7747,16933,2437,562,1760,29892,2331,544,30037,794,361,29892,3503,15087,649,1387,1671,966,4439,3076,20498,882,29889,7747,2947,439,29915,265,13618,9411,966,1248,1654,414,818,301,29915,267,1052,1943,634,8532,29892,25921,966,17103,1973,316,2085,424,29892,25921,966,1035,434,1973,634,427,4951,1224,966,4434,1759,267,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,17953,3277,6273,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,5198,348,1228,27580,14502,896,526,14338,338,11828,297,4145,1218,23900,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,13173,7309,800,310,278,16021,22001,322,7208,12903,9701,297,278,5198,348,1228,27580,14502,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,14502,20789,20811,2919,3694,310,938,945,514,1070,3279,1144,2000,938,27083,1475,29892,896,437,451,5649,920,1438,3279,1144,664,470,2020,896,526,11828,297,4145,1218,23900,29889,9133,4821,901,16905,4902,322,7309,800,1033,1371,304,2048,6625,4127,322,7602,2463,297,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,3030,322,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,14502,338,11828,363,916,4072,310,23900,8724,715,398,482,23900,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,2472,896,505,22229,338,884,22903,304,916,508,22543,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,11898,304,2304,445,5995,29889,9133,4821,901,18387,10757,322,6455,1033,1371,304,9324,264,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,322,1207,372,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,10757,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,20408,294,573,304,1207,278,12032,901,11828,297,17953,3277,278,20026,310,278,2779,20193,310,278,5198,348,1228,27580,14502,29889],"total_duration":67796586559,"load_duration":243065,"prompt_eval_count":299,"prompt_eval_duration":27378619000,"eval_count":319,"eval_duration":40417121000}
