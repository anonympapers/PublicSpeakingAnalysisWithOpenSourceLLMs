{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T16:02:20.799959594Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some convincing arguments and reasoning to support their claim that the monoxide d'azote could be used as a treatment for infections. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, the speaker does not provide any empirical evidence or scientific studies to support their claims about the effectiveness of the monoxide d'azote. While they mention that they have studied how the molecule acts on Vacterie and toxins in the intestine, they do not provide any details or data to back up these claims. This lack of supporting evidence makes it difficult to fully trust the speaker's arguments.\n\nSecondly, the speaker does not address potential limitations or drawbacks of using the monoxide d'azote as a treatment. They do not consider alternative explanations for why the Vacterie may be resistant to the molecule, or how the treatment could interact with other factors in the body. By ignoring these potential issues, the speaker does not provide a comprehensive picture of the treatment's effectiveness.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some persuasive arguments and reasoning, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported. A score of 3 out of 5 is therefore the most appropriate evaluation for this transcript.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1671,301,6463,8474,301,29915,262,20309,29889,365,29915,1540,270,29915,4999,269,29915,932,1808,454,1601,2251,680,270,29915,834,866,29889,1551,1671,8356,454,5734,261,782,7171,311,1750,17512,15532,454,7167,634,1487,15390,316,260,2853,966,8575,4167,16568,2395,29892,3503,2331,25235,6366,815,1671,9411,966,904,2576,1475,29889,838,943,1671,7848,29899,309,29892,980,610,19682,818,2970,3999,904,371,8842,634,2298,20081,29889,897,425,6701,2258,15529,29892,373,872,277,712,454,1601,2251,680,270,29915,834,866,1841,700,277,454,2245,316,478,5761,347,634,316,304,29916,262,1465,443,1243,262,29889,11948,2257,302,29915,342,2331,9378,275,424,1671,1597,13745,262,20309,29889,7747,1841,1376,1950,12866,29892,5291,3667,4637,29920,5278,6062,29948,1810,412,4191,1020,17334,29889,315,29915,342,925,882,425,1139,818,22025,1444,14954,1173,425,1841,689,29872,2535,611,17949,29889,6803,18729,29892,432,29915,1794,2852,4749,29948,3440,454,1601,2251,680,270,29915,834,866,946,5582,1190,966,478,5761,347,634,966,304,29916,262,1465,301,29915,524,342,262,29889,8748,818,301,29915,262,3901,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,3479,8774,3068,1608,267,22700,743,610,425,478,5761,347,1671,6896,1531,782,1601,2251,680,270,29915,834,866,29889,838,943,1354,29892,4191,7890,29871,22730,2411,271,993,316,4048,6390,1354,425,7631,4371,16933,12507,345,1924,29892,2123,1354,454,1601,2251,680,270,29915,834,866,1671,8356,7848,28643,4191,1020,17334,29892,19643,29920,29899,23088,1465,13545,17478,818,425,1436,316,425,12320,29892,2123,28185,9373,818,425,1436,316,611,17949,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,1601,2251,680,270,29915,834,866,1033,367,1304,408,263,14502,363,297,1725,1953,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,470,16021,11898,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,278,1601,2251,680,270,29915,834,866,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,505,12399,920,278,13206,29883,1297,14741,373,478,5761,347,322,304,29916,1144,297,278,938,342,457,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,4902,470,848,304,1250,701,1438,16726,29889,910,10225,310,20382,10757,3732,372,5189,304,8072,9311,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,947,451,3211,7037,27028,470,4216,1627,29879,310,773,278,1601,2251,680,270,29915,834,866,408,263,14502,29889,2688,437,451,2050,8671,7309,800,363,2020,278,478,5761,347,1122,367,9241,424,304,278,13206,29883,1297,29892,470,920,278,14502,1033,16254,411,916,13879,297,278,3573,29889,2648,5330,8253,1438,7037,5626,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,263,15171,6270,7623,310,278,14502,29915,29879,2779,20193,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,20408,294,573,6273,322,24481,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,338,5480,278,1556,8210,17983,363,445,1301,924,29889],"total_duration":66052186762,"load_duration":193881,"prompt_eval_count":322,"prompt_eval_duration":27047851000,"eval_count":319,"eval_duration":39003631000}
