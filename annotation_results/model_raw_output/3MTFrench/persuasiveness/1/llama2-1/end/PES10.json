{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T12:40:53.441775411Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speech's persuasiveness and rigor of reasoning. The speaker does a good job of presenting their idea in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where they could improve.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claim that the network of public sensors is linked to the mutations in Paris. While they mention the concept of \"nouvelle id√©ale urbaine,\" they do not provide any specific examples or data to demonstrate how the network of public sensors can contribute to this idea.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or challenges to their proposal. For example, they could have discussed how the installation of sensors on every plot of land in Paris might be met with resistance from property owners, or how the cost of implementing such a system might be prohibitively expensive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and compelling vision for how the network of public sensors could contribute to the development of a smart city, there are some areas where they could improve in terms of providing evidence and addressing potential challenges to their proposal.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,18484,297,1365,7808,2535,454,28710,553,1067,29948,22428,970,29879,29892,610,346,712,274,29915,342,443,6964,316,1067,29948,22428,970,29892,443,302,9095,1178,21659,23499,475,29889,3872,29883,29892,980,343,263,443,325,2736,8356,926,261,966,2117,371,1295,1190,18402,28974,332,29889,478,681,439,29915,265,263,443,28710,16474,1465,12563,425,8441,29892,23563,325,2736,336,993,2852,9030,3058,267,13973,316,425,8441,1671,904,16398,381,261,2298,13052,331,358,29889,315,29915,342,325,17016,712,5291,408,2730,26665,316,7199,9030,29871,4277,29889,461,707,29899,346,712,454,28710,553,1067,29948,22428,970,29879,707,619,29948,3479,5478,800,610,275,7081,29973,8748,3440,707,29899,346,439,29915,309,8164,6787,533,1597,8441,13052,2016,1354,443,13547,6964,1863,296,29973,8396,29892,980,592,18062,443,7006,316,8714,29889,29871,30219,29874,2411,1908,316,7890,1518,492,7808,1671,339,7768,2257,1804,342,2331,443,3814,316,610,275,29889,1704,29892,4191,1465,454,19489,30000,1030,1591,585,29892,2257,455,707,1597,12450,9233,868,3814,316,610,275,29889,317,4987,439,29915,1654,29892,454,16868,276,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,443,4348,29884,29892,454,16868,276,29871,1654,29892,274,29915,342,1601,17887,521,283,29892,454,28710,553,1067,29948,22428,970,29879,29889,751,29875,263,8019,316,425,6731,4437,818,6808,4983,454,3814,316,610,275,282,20342,29892,634,868,17103,3911,263,27282,872,13618,29889,8748,274,29915,342,443,11412,29892,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,712,7890,3669,854,6096,868,28710,553,1067,29948,22428,970,29879,29892,634,12784,712,1597,15422,1318,610,4788,26020,818,425,13618,316,425,8441,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,12032,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,3564,310,970,4771,943,338,9024,304,278,5478,800,297,3681,29889,5806,896,3585,278,6964,310,376,29876,10796,1178,29948,744,5065,2291,457,1699,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,22222,920,278,3564,310,970,4771,943,508,29126,304,445,2969,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,18066,267,304,1009,24963,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,1033,505,15648,920,278,11161,310,4771,943,373,1432,6492,310,2982,297,3681,1795,367,1539,411,17711,515,2875,1914,414,29892,470,920,278,3438,310,16049,1316,263,1788,1795,367,21460,277,3598,19390,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,752,7807,18551,363,920,278,3564,310,970,4771,943,1033,29126,304,278,5849,310,263,15040,4272,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,297,4958,310,13138,10757,322,3211,292,7037,18066,267,304,1009,24963,29889],"total_duration":63244691633,"load_duration":157965,"prompt_eval_count":330,"prompt_eval_duration":30362349000,"eval_count":259,"eval_duration":32881770000}
