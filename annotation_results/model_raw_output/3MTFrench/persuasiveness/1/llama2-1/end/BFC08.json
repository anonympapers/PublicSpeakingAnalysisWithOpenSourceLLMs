{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T13:01:08.812486262Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and examples to support their message, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of relatable analogies, such as comparing Big Data Intelligence Artificial (BDIA) to a superhero, which helps to make complex concepts more accessible for the intended audience. The speaker also acknowledges potential concerns and addresses them directly, which shows they have thoughtfully considered multiple perspectives.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a claim that BDIA can help PMEs like Scuder to remain competitive in the industry 14.0 without providing specific examples or data to support this claim. Additionally, while the speaker acknowledges potential concerns about BDIA replacing human workers, they do not provide a clear explanation of how BDIA can coexist with humans in a way that benefits both parties.\n\nOverall, while the speech presents some convincing arguments, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by data or examples to make the message even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,10273,2249,436,1379,818,6628,1314,966,330,1064,2406,29889,365,29915,265,24853,9638,22781,270,29915,290,1131,749,634,316,7697,276,553,451,1080,4280,267,13547,712,7997,3630,3159,28286,3012,928,616,1203,29948,15579,1671,1597,349,2303,4191,2522,18309,29892,18934,316,4325,1454,2265,872,752,277,440,2131,634,425,1539,2484,1190,425,364,347,316,301,29915,20041,2546,29871,29896,29946,29889,29900,29889,14304,6311,29892,980,707,443,325,17016,427,1324,398,424,29892,13704,316,7602,475,1037,12255,1720,18441,712,301,29915,524,28286,19069,11381,302,29915,342,2331,18916,1671,966,1539,2484,818,425,14931,29892,1671,454,2298,5646,1671,7697,276,6267,5039,2131,2298,6366,815,29889,897,425,11201,30001,11201,30001,29892,316,425,2298,885,18309,29892,409,6427,8284,274,2426,15217,28602,2131,18934,316,4325,1454,2265,301,29915,1893,566,12361,316,301,29915,29909,14326,634,21933,14001,29899,4346,29875,818,301,29915,932,29880,2450,553,29314,1671,301,29915,20041,2546,316,1261,475,29889,435,29915,9983,1908,712,1444,7890,7468,7602,475,17851,4191,432,29915,1794,7602,475,17851,12255,1720,18441,316,23532,3041,327,9373,1671,592,1462,9555,1465,1487,3022,2470,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,6455,304,2304,1009,2643,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,1104,17219,15690,583,29892,1316,408,17420,7997,3630,3159,28286,3012,928,616,313,29933,4571,29909,29897,304,263,2428,29882,1489,29892,607,6911,304,1207,4280,22001,901,15579,363,278,9146,20026,29889,450,25657,884,24084,2710,7037,21838,322,14157,963,4153,29892,607,3697,896,505,2714,3730,5545,2999,3736,1103,3145,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,393,350,4571,29909,508,1371,349,2303,29879,763,2522,18309,304,3933,5100,3321,297,278,13661,29871,29896,29946,29889,29900,1728,13138,2702,6455,470,848,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,1550,278,25657,24084,2710,7037,21838,1048,350,4571,29909,15270,5199,17162,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,2821,8252,310,920,350,4571,29909,508,1302,28997,411,25618,297,263,982,393,23633,1716,13973,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,848,470,6455,304,1207,278,2643,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":53694410442,"load_duration":257626,"prompt_eval_count":237,"prompt_eval_duration":20265158000,"eval_count":273,"eval_duration":33428436000}
