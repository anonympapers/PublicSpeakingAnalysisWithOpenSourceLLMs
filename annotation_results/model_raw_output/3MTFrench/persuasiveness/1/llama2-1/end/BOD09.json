The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument for their proposed solution to the problem of lack of conviction in the French educational system. They provide logical reasoning and evidence from existing research to support their claims.\n\nThe speaker also acknowledges the complexity of the issue and their own role within the system, which adds credibility to their argument. However, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened. For example, the speaker could have provided more specific examples of how their proposed solution would work in practice, or addressed potential counterarguments that may arise.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a convincing message and demonstrates a rigorous approach to problem-solving.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,611,1437,3034,1173,1136,2488,818,9484,261,553,6314,3145,316,18848,2535,966,23930,647,1934,24792,7147,634,9073,427,29835,712,7015,6314,3145,938,20608,1041,6728,19882,443,14738,8182,277,1190,454,23930,647,424,29892,3503,5695,553,15001,1379,6343,271,10270,29892,553,1044,11620,868,9122,5264,23837,1387,634,6079,10019,680,29885,358,553,2852,4749,1934,29889,350,999,29892,301,29915,24031,553,1044,11620,1671,1597,1841,1808,13852,868,21423,634,274,29915,342,18916,6722,29871,4277,409,752,9854,29889,1459,346,712,19601,5695,29892,1444,16623,8691,868,21423,29889,838,943,7890,4788,29920,592,2970,3503,3440,8164,29899,5474,1597,23520,2854,634,5713,519,29973,8748,6079,29892,1444,325,1759,286,759,553,2637,2034,575,634,553,2531,690,1841,16041,10270,29889,2581,325,1759,16455,643,553,21195,316,18848,270,29915,24430,2535,966,23930,647,1934,29892,3503,5695,2535,966,2852,4749,1934,634,2535,425,5178,453,1908,282,2487,13247,1387,29889,1632,20032,818,5278,23520,29892,432,29915,9983,1908,17737,2853,3479,15570,3409,4110,282,2487,13247,3783,316,301,29915,1947,647,882,13159,14508,7691,29889,8748,818,425,1841,1558,568,270,29915,348,2298,4595,5419,270,29915,1893,4749,1934,29892,13545,577,1144,316,10713,20077,29879,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,373,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,363,1009,7972,1650,304,278,1108,310,10225,310,7602,2463,297,278,5176,28976,1788,29889,2688,3867,16667,24481,322,10757,515,5923,5925,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,13,13,1576,25657,884,24084,2710,278,13644,310,278,2228,322,1009,1914,6297,2629,278,1788,29892,607,12778,6625,4127,304,1009,2980,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,310,920,1009,7972,1650,723,664,297,6944,29892,470,20976,7037,6795,25699,393,1122,29030,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,17953,3277,2643,322,9004,1078,263,12912,20657,2948,304,1108,29899,2929,1747,29889],"total_duration":43969770563,"load_duration":217229,"prompt_eval_count":249,"prompt_eval_duration":22701444000,"eval_count":171,"eval_duration":21267647000}
