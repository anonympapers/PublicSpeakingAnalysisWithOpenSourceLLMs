The speaker presents their idea in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more convincing and well-supported.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could provide more evidence to support their claim that their alternative vernis is just as good as the famous Stradivarius violins. While they mention that their product is \"bien s√ªr\" (of course) made locally and contains no products derived from oil, they do not provide any specific examples or data to demonstrate its quality. Additionally, they could provide more detail on how their product compares to the Stradivarius violins in terms of sound quality, durability, and other relevant factors.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could provide a more detailed explanation of their analysis process. While they mention that they use appliances in their laboratory to analyze the esthetic and mechanical characteristics of their product, they do not provide any information on the specific types of appliances they use or how they conduct their analyses. Providing this detail could help to build credibility and demonstrate the rigor of their analysis.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear idea and shows enthusiasm for their product, there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more persuasive and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,316,425,784,3021,1662,29892,1444,24853,782,6299,14913,29892,432,29915,1175,2663,13545,788,277,10270,29892,3390,434,1314,316,425,3814,12973,427,6896,16589,12416,424,29892,1444,24853,782,6299,14913,634,269,29915,29948,18821,261,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,301,29915,932,9854,1190,553,904,13775,453,787,316,592,431,793,29892,1444,269,30000,1173,29892,634,432,29915,24209,344,7015,1559,23096,707,1893,3783,634,8774,3068,3783,29892,4191,610,17488,425,1506,647,749,29892,425,3581,20519,29892,2123,10440,425,1437,11115,29892,23068,818,553,623,598,2719,270,29915,24209,344,712,432,29915,1794,782,10212,20141,29889,3872,29883,1671,6896,4680,29892,1601,18848,1136,2488,818,21136,5711,261,443,24604,275,1750,12852,29889,26219,269,30095,29878,29892,274,29915,342,10135,374,17851,1180,6311,29892,16497,275,424,425,784,3021,1662,29892,452,16962,424,20480,348,27666,17759,868,282,1893,12154,29892,3390,434,1314,316,425,3814,12973,29892,634,2535,553,21637,5695,904,2608,2406,712,966,1436,2187,553,19489,30000,16105,5537,787,29892,26742,2445,347,29899,5927,375,29892,1671,534,8885,1597,8671,782,24604,275,17759,316,425,20674,347,868,282,1893,12154,29892,634,1671,439,29915,264,1436,29892,454,6788,1766,21998,364,14056,29892,1465,454,282,424,354,265,553,23662,7719,301,29915,392,5340,29892,925,29872,818,21384,868,2320,2267,29889,2581,7890,337,1050,5295,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,1009,8671,24604,275,338,925,408,1781,408,278,13834,3767,328,440,19563,5537,1144,29889,5806,896,3585,393,1009,3234,338,376,29890,819,269,30095,29878,29908,313,974,3236,29897,1754,12430,322,3743,694,9316,10723,515,17182,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,22222,967,11029,29889,19814,29892,896,1033,3867,901,9493,373,920,1009,3234,752,5114,304,278,3767,328,440,19563,5537,1144,297,4958,310,6047,11029,29892,1411,3097,29892,322,916,8018,13879,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,1033,3867,263,901,13173,8252,310,1009,7418,1889,29889,5806,896,3585,393,896,671,623,492,2925,297,1009,10212,7606,304,27599,278,707,29882,7492,322,28310,21862,310,1009,3234,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2472,373,278,2702,4072,310,623,492,2925,896,671,470,920,896,7512,1009,3483,952,267,29889,9133,4821,445,9493,1033,1371,304,2048,6625,4127,322,22222,278,12912,272,310,1009,7418,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,2969,322,3697,23644,3173,29885,363,1009,3234,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,20408,294,573,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":63698904390,"load_duration":255840,"prompt_eval_count":276,"prompt_eval_duration":25043467000,"eval_count":306,"eval_duration":38654687000}
