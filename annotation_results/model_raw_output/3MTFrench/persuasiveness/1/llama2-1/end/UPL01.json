{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T18:01:02.556683514Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by presenting a clear and well-structured argument, using evidence and examples to support their claims. They also use rhetorical devices such as repetition and emphasis to drive home their points.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker's assertion that \"les acceptés acceptés leur souffrance en les réhumanisants\" could be supported by more empirical evidence or logical reasoning. Additionally, some of the sentences could be more concise and easier to follow, which would make the argument even more persuasive.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a strong argument that is well-supported with examples and evidence, but could benefit from further refinement in terms of rigorous reasoning and clarity of expression.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1190,454,7175,1113,895,634,1190,439,29915,29874,30085,29883,439,29915,1808,6411,1249,966,19397,29879,270,29915,1540,7632,2893,9407,29889,4785,4233,454,8442,3165,475,316,611,266,17449,29892,4883,332,275,301,29915,6574,627,316,5278,9982,22481,20364,634,1020,398,15819,1190,454,13382,818,301,29915,627,284,868,301,371,29889,16457,332,743,15093,10879,1671,336,19172,276,818,20689,316,4224,1241,316,26957,3736,1103,3145,316,577,1144,29889,341,13805,1020,1524,966,19117,29892,274,29915,342,10042,5646,29889,2664,3544,743,3544,743,6267,3669,600,11115,427,966,1841,26029,275,1934,29889,315,29915,342,274,29915,342,316,610,1358,316,1601,13045,29892,4883,6454,267,29892,274,29915,342,2756,3568,29948,24145,10641,882,818,425,18085,2131,3165,9874,1750,5246,425,639,262,2131,316,24145,831,1129,381,29889,6101,8556,343,564,3511,787,21285,29892,8556,724,787,427,29188,270,29915,3470,381,2463,634,521,2593,690,1750,20389,296,427,2257,3256,6701,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,25554,29879,263,17953,3277,2643,491,2198,292,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,773,10757,322,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2688,884,671,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,19310,275,304,7899,3271,1009,3291,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,376,793,3544,743,3544,743,6267,3669,600,11115,427,966,1841,26029,275,1934,29908,1033,367,6969,491,901,29190,936,10757,470,16667,24481,29889,19814,29892,777,310,278,25260,1033,367,901,3022,895,322,6775,304,1101,29892,607,723,1207,278,2980,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,4549,2980,393,338,1532,29899,23765,411,6455,322,10757,29892,541,1033,14169,515,4340,2143,262,882,297,4958,310,12912,20657,24481,322,7542,537,310,4603,29889],"total_duration":41263402931,"load_duration":192199,"prompt_eval_count":198,"prompt_eval_duration":16547478000,"eval_count":204,"eval_duration":24715302000}
