The speaker presents some valid points about the importance of considering the propagation of corrosion in bridge design and maintenance, but their reasoning is not entirely rigorous.\n\nThe speaker makes some general claims without providing sufficient evidence or logic to support them. For example, they state that \"la particularité de mettre avant de recherche est d'intégrer la passe de propagation de corrosion de bon l'avis d'ouvrage\" (the particularity of putting before research is to integrate the passage of propagation of corrosion in the advice of the structure), but do not provide any data or studies to back up this claim.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's argument that the risk of collapse becomes major only when corrosion reaches an advanced stage is not entirely accurate. While it is true that corrosion can significantly weaken a bridge and increase the risk of collapse, there are many other factors that can also contribute to the failure of a bridge, such as poor design, inadequate maintenance, and external forces like traffic and weather conditions.\n\nOverall, while the speaker raises some important points about corrosion and bridge maintenance, their reasoning is not entirely rigorous and could benefit from more evidence and logical reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,997,1841,3820,290,609,362,1044,13498,7755,712,425,1411,1318,316,2669,270,29915,348,19612,6617,707,21609,6693,1597,10098,425,1034,1883,291,626,473,29883,1318,29889,315,29915,342,427,5246,454,610,497,15340,29889,365,29915,16063,475,707,16133,1064,1318,5758,1597,15096,4082,311,29889,7747,1750,452,2331,325,17016,427,10684,29892,425,3153,2131,316,1539,2484,10042,316,23520,707,270,29915,524,27083,261,425,21714,316,13089,362,316,1034,1883,291,316,10814,301,29915,485,275,270,29915,5128,6617,29889,315,29915,342,1411,29948,818,7848,782,425,1841,862,261,1597,2123,1765,545,316,325,4582,545,316,4239,26893,427,325,19680,29899,348,29899,348,3533,326,14228,29892,1597,22577,18286,17417,29889,8526,2257,380,1943,29899,27048,29892,966,21637,8774,3068,3783,868,13185,452,3435,2331,6023,743,29889,951,5161,802,316,301,29915,12352,898,276,358,316,301,29915,5128,6617,15210,611,1324,332,23422,18097,425,1034,1883,291,21609,6693,316,380,1943,1029,4564,1318,29889,478,681,301,29915,1351,29920,6079,7199,275,29889,997,285,1099,2131,316,1539,2484,818,26814,23520,707,270,29915,29874,1241,634,316,1410,1241,966,2348,1690,8894,316,2258,15529,818,5994,7608,443,5256,895,818,425,1411,1318,316,2669,553,19612,6617,4625,289,30037,7453,5075,743,29889,315,29915,342,1411,29948,29889,2726,1209,681,325,609,301,29915,9983,29948,11115,868,6316,868,2560,1190,305,585,2265,454,3514,1004,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,2854,3291,1048,278,13500,310,13858,278,13089,362,310,1034,1883,291,297,12945,2874,322,25413,29892,541,1009,24481,338,451,9186,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3732,777,2498,16726,1728,13138,8002,10757,470,5900,304,2304,963,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,2106,393,376,433,3153,2131,316,1539,2484,10042,316,23520,707,270,29915,524,27083,261,425,21714,316,13089,362,316,1034,1883,291,316,10814,301,29915,485,275,270,29915,5128,6617,29908,313,1552,3153,537,310,10594,1434,5925,338,304,22782,278,13382,310,13089,362,310,1034,1883,291,297,278,9848,310,278,3829,511,541,437,451,3867,738,848,470,11898,304,1250,701,445,5995,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,12045,310,24382,7415,4655,871,746,1034,1883,291,22170,385,12862,7408,338,451,9186,16232,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,1034,1883,291,508,16951,8062,264,263,12945,322,7910,278,12045,310,24382,29892,727,526,1784,916,13879,393,508,884,29126,304,278,10672,310,263,12945,29892,1316,408,6460,2874,29892,297,1943,339,403,25413,29892,322,7029,8249,763,12469,322,14826,5855,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,1153,4637,777,4100,3291,1048,1034,1883,291,322,12945,25413,29892,1009,24481,338,451,9186,12912,20657,322,1033,14169,515,901,10757,322,16667,24481,29889],"total_duration":62635017682,"load_duration":151922,"prompt_eval_count":287,"prompt_eval_duration":25926068000,"eval_count":290,"eval_duration":36708392000}
