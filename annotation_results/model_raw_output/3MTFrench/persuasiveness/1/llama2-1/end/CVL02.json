The speaker provides some logical reasoning and evidence to support their claims, but there are also some areas where their argument could be strengthened.\n\nOne of the strengths of the speaker's argument is their clear explanation of how the virus works and how it interacts with the host cell. They use simple language and provide concrete examples to help illustrate their points, which makes their argument more accessible and easier to understand. Additionally, they demonstrate a good understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the process, which adds credibility to their argument.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve their argument. For example, they do not provide any empirical evidence or scientific studies to support their claims, which could make their argument more convincing and persuasive. Additionally, some of their statements are somewhat vague or unclear, such as when they say \"étudier les interactions de ce récepteur avec l'hyvermectin,\" which lacks specificity and clarity.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and logical argument, there is room for improvement in terms of providing more concrete evidence and specific examples to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2123,409,285,10877,29889,951,1147,915,332,610,756,568,263,1597,1178,1318,4191,289,692,261,29892,286,4600,29892,409,9483,533,29892,301,29915,333,1318,21714,818,13310,872,16345,371,332,634,17424,28123,3158,29892,12866,286,4600,29892,289,692,261,29892,409,9483,533,29889,365,29915,5819,369,29885,522,262,29892,4875,29892,2947,409,2329,261,1190,872,1841,13300,371,332,634,3710,30037,4630,454,1147,915,332,304,12036,261,14984,7015,8820,29889,951,1147,915,332,707,610,14997,11728,634,2947,29442,12416,29889,11948,1354,454,1147,915,332,707,6896,22137,29892,301,29915,5819,369,29885,522,262,452,1671,336,18413,2329,261,1190,454,1841,13300,371,332,634,868,17103,454,1147,915,332,2947,7294,2872,13220,358,1465,454,521,585,295,29889,951,541,316,611,266,17449,29892,20737,2893,29792,29892,274,29915,342,1841,13300,371,332,634,454,534,8885,425,289,7293,15259,427,5898,29899,348,2131,1671,712,29871,4277,2947,269,29915,370,371,332,1190,18165,9139,29889,8748,868,17103,2852,566,631,966,22060,316,2257,1841,13300,371,332,2535,301,29915,5819,369,29885,522,262,29892,425,6062,1893,352,1387,707,2411,492,17851,29892,1750,707,3667,15826,1671,1020,1524,2257,610,294,568,29889,9353,443,18768,8714,29892,1444,325,1759,286,29915,524,1064,16136,3479,5478,800,316,6896,21558,1750,263,1190,2257,1841,13300,371,332,1671,13942,29877,2496,1597,15217,26742,2445,347,634,640,1581,425,6896,21558,29889,478,681,282,6223,29920,640,29948,1190,19601,1671,12507,369,966,12509,1691,29892,1444,325,1759,5646,27516,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,322,2198,1009,2980,20408,294,3598,29889,450,25657,8128,777,16667,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,1009,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6716,310,278,9324,29879,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,338,1009,2821,8252,310,920,278,24424,1736,322,920,372,16254,29879,411,278,3495,3038,29889,2688,671,2560,4086,322,3867,18387,6455,304,1371,28475,1009,3291,29892,607,3732,1009,2980,901,15579,322,6775,304,2274,29889,19814,29892,896,22222,263,1781,8004,310,278,13206,16637,7208,12903,9701,297,278,1889,29892,607,12778,6625,4127,304,1009,2980,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,2980,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,470,16021,11898,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,607,1033,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,322,20408,294,573,29889,19814,29892,777,310,1009,9506,526,10579,25160,470,20871,29892,1316,408,746,896,1827,376,1893,566,631,966,22060,316,2257,1841,13300,371,332,2535,301,29915,5819,369,29885,522,262,1699,607,425,4684,2702,537,322,7542,537,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,16667,2980,29892,727,338,5716,363,20414,297,4958,310,13138,901,18387,10757,322,2702,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":64441797175,"load_duration":153718,"prompt_eval_count":312,"prompt_eval_duration":28445175000,"eval_count":282,"eval_duration":35995996000}
