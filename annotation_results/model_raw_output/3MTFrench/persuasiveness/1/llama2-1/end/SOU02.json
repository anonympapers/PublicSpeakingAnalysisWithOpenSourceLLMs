The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using specific examples to illustrate their points. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For instance, the speaker's claim that \"le porte d'entrée est gardé par des traditions centrées sur l'homme\" could be supported by more empirical evidence or historical context. Additionally, the speaker's use of the phrase \"nous pouvons montrer au prochain génération que le génie musical n'a pas de vue\" feels slightly simplistic and could benefit from further development. Overall, while the speaker presents a compelling argument, there are areas where the reasoning could be more nuanced and rigorous.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,425,29452,270,29915,29909,16582,2200,316,1487,6094,347,29889,2581,1539,29879,427,10042,966,3184,10270,25766,1750,302,29915,2987,358,10978,4191,610,2320,347,818,13310,553,298,5137,2658,316,18402,3036,346,585,29889,6101,8556,3669,29882,1249,787,29892,634,301,29915,23641,302,29915,29874,2002,993,2331,316,15911,1190,454,6094,347,9636,8556,2906,24416,544,30037,357,8570,782,5541,29948,1605,275,29889,10016,15096,1190,29881,283,1318,9484,25572,4191,23650,1867,818,553,14979,23435,1671,7848,1035,434,12840,634,1671,7848,3544,29948,1465,425,1559,23497,316,425,15188,770,1387,29889,1704,454,14931,270,29915,14856,1318,707,17161,29948,610,553,3534,2187,1644,29878,2406,1190,301,29915,21708,29889,1174,707,2852,566,291,1671,301,29915,262,7214,1867,29892,1444,7890,22847,1597,15188,443,1826,585,3503,427,302,29915,342,782,11387,425,1236,29874,431,280,316,301,29915,442,29889,10793,904,16398,3055,479,16933,443,9565,8774,11958,585,316,425,298,6844,316,454,15188,19612,336,3055,29892,1444,5152,1908,29892,1597,14931,1671,966,6316,1314,553,29026,5445,267,818,6003,381,29889,422,1004,29871,4277,29892,8556,24684,787,1601,509,261,782,410,14153,6094,10500,712,454,6094,347,9636,302,29915,29874,2331,316,15911,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,773,2702,6455,304,28475,1009,3291,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,376,280,14931,270,29915,14856,1318,707,17161,29948,610,553,3534,2187,1644,29878,2406,1190,301,29915,21708,29908,1033,367,6969,491,901,29190,936,10757,470,15839,3030,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,278,16549,376,29876,681,24684,787,1601,509,261,782,410,14153,6094,10500,712,454,6094,347,9636,302,29915,29874,2331,316,15911,29908,23880,10029,5466,4695,322,1033,14169,515,4340,5849,29889,6811,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,752,7807,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,4948,8362,322,12912,20657,29889],"total_duration":45301106832,"load_duration":144977,"prompt_eval_count":248,"prompt_eval_duration":22753592000,"eval_count":179,"eval_duration":22546898000}
