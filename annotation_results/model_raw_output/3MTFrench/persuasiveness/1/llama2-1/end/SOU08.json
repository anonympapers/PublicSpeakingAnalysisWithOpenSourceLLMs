{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T05:34:41.111324642Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker makes a compelling point about the lack of human presence in certain regions during specific time periods, which is supported by scientific evidence. However, they do not provide enough context or evidence to fully substantiate their claims about the reasons behind these population movements. For example, while they mention climate change and resource scarcity as potential factors, they do not offer any concrete examples or studies to back up these assertions.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's time limit of 90 seconds is a significant limitation in terms of presenting a comprehensive argument. While they manage to convey their main point within this time frame, a more detailed and well-supported analysis would require more time and resources to develop.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a intriguing hypothesis about prehistoric migration patterns, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and supported by additional evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,19601,427,28504,1671,270,29915,932,7367,1597,270,29915,7192,2209,309,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,425,270,29915,1131,362,29892,29871,4277,7890,18332,443,8714,3503,26154,29892,29871,4277,7890,427,16067,29889,1174,4951,29892,427,2058,427,5646,4883,16285,270,29915,1131,2509,29892,427,7167,270,29915,264,339,9061,29892,432,29915,264,7468,553,868,1169,712,1465,7015,4071,698,267,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,11878,316,29845,3165,9874,2637,29871,29946,29900,14746,634,29871,29896,29945,14746,10042,24145,4799,29889,2726,14954,1173,1295,4625,2852,4749,29948,454,10784,271,1209,29948,634,5278,29271,29881,370,9948,1302,2173,311,818,3772,2172,29899,29925,554,9577,263,2426,427,5646,3209,29889,365,29915,29882,1478,720,17449,263,2653,16269,634,712,1465,7015,4071,698,267,29892,966,5730,5908,23093,4625,9725,29948,818,4556,270,29915,1540,21733,316,301,29915,21813,17239,634,316,18475,2863,20196,7147,29889,29871,29906,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,6063,2298,11364,29892,270,29915,14559,23093,3435,20957,375,634,980,343,263,289,2131,8164,29899,5474,818,4556,270,29915,348,10784,271,2298,7853,519,29889,10793,22085,9061,302,29915,342,439,29915,1540,2930,10491,270,29915,348,4595,20285,280,29892,1559,270,29915,14559,7537,11789,707,3902,272,1318,1671,659,1241,7015,13752,2093,267,634,8164,29899,5474,6787,533,553,7774,267,316,9725,800,7175,16211,3783,2298,7175,3476,267,1465,454,8714,29889,27677,29871,29929,29900,1473,267,29892,274,29915,342,454,8714,1750,286,29915,29874,6416,29884,1671,1518,492,7808,611,266,17449,29889,11948,301,29915,13624,316,7814,10359,30037,5888,302,29915,342,2331,1597,7175,1730,371,29899,14119,868,8714,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2980,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,3732,263,752,7807,1298,1048,278,10225,310,5199,10122,297,3058,12786,2645,2702,931,23704,29892,607,338,6969,491,16021,10757,29889,2398,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,3030,470,10757,304,8072,5960,3656,403,1009,16726,1048,278,9590,5742,1438,4665,24147,29889,1152,1342,29892,1550,896,3585,23622,1735,322,6503,19494,537,408,7037,13879,29892,896,437,451,5957,738,18387,6455,470,11898,304,1250,701,1438,4974,1080,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,931,4046,310,29871,29929,29900,6923,338,263,7282,29485,297,4958,310,2198,292,263,15171,6270,2980,29889,5806,896,10933,304,27769,1009,1667,1298,2629,445,931,3515,29892,263,901,13173,322,1532,29899,23765,7418,723,1996,901,931,322,7788,304,2693,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,11158,5526,292,20051,1048,758,16211,293,20332,15038,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,6969,491,5684,10757,29889],"total_duration":61491472318,"load_duration":225483,"prompt_eval_count":328,"prompt_eval_duration":30306342000,"eval_count":246,"eval_duration":31184280000}
