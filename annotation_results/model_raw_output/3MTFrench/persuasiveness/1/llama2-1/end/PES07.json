The speaker presents a clear and convincing message about the importance of using biodegradable materials in construction to achieve sustainability. They provide specific examples of how this can be achieved by valorizing waste from the food industry and using it to create innovative building materials.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is rigorous, citing laboratory tests that demonstrate the comparability of these new materials to traditional ones. They also emphasize the need for a change in perspective and approach in order to achieve sustainable construction practices.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speech could be improved. For example, the speaker could have provided more specific examples of how their proposed materials would perform in different environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity. Additionally, they could have addressed potential concerns about the cost-effectiveness of using these new materials compared to traditional ones.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a compelling argument for the use of biodegradable materials in construction, and their persuasive skills are evident throughout the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1775,4894,2993,782,2930,10491,316,3829,1671,425,7632,1411,519,29889,341,2353,553,1757,267,818,3060,275,381,966,282,14229,316,18249,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,966,21136,1379,5695,29892,7847,339,29915,265,966,5663,6223,9411,1465,966,2428,29885,1279,743,2535,966,7067,29879,427,626,347,270,29915,265,29889,4546,29875,29892,432,29915,1794,3060,10770,270,29915,14559,17751,1893,2993,29889,435,29915,1794,3060,10770,316,16497,7608,966,1437,305,1691,316,301,29915,20041,2546,20196,5218,29892,4191,425,282,2736,276,427,1173,610,17488,29892,2123,10440,553,6062,29948,21337,1750,20423,7848,4805,1169,316,425,260,2231,553,715,3794,4191,454,6282,316,899,1750,29892,818,2257,8694,29892,302,29915,342,2331,16497,11728,29889,23719,1039,29892,818,8019,316,7015,4239,2348,29878,2487,10070,29892,980,707,1950,316,6787,533,425,8441,316,1261,475,29889,1551,707,5246,966,5730,5908,1559,16027,275,800,4824,3783,782,10212,20141,29892,373,7629,8356,712,7015,1775,4894,2993,29871,29896,29900,29900,29995,17799,29899,29879,473,29883,743,3435,5734,1849,818,301,29915,487,1924,1750,659,296,29871,1654,316,425,282,1893,307,305,326,347,29889,1720,452,269,29915,23121,2331,316,534,8885,553,6851,1671,1841,862,261,966,1437,29887,1446,712,8556,1029,787,3269,29948,29889,11948,28185,9373,316,1874,261,24145,18551,316,9073,966,521,15806,29889,1704,5278,9558,707,1597,16253,2131,29889,4702,455,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,17953,3277,2643,1048,278,13500,310,773,4768,356,5105,519,17279,297,7632,304,6176,15075,475,3097,29889,2688,3867,2702,6455,310,920,445,508,367,14363,491,16497,5281,19863,515,278,9687,13661,322,773,372,304,1653,24233,1230,5214,17279,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,12912,20657,29892,7537,292,10212,7606,6987,393,22222,278,5734,3097,310,1438,716,17279,304,13807,6743,29889,2688,884,19310,675,278,817,363,263,1735,297,18520,322,2948,297,1797,304,6176,15075,475,519,7632,23274,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,12032,1033,367,16710,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,2702,6455,310,920,1009,7972,17279,723,2189,297,1422,29380,5855,29892,1316,408,10430,322,3165,333,537,29889,19814,29892,896,1033,505,20976,7037,21838,1048,278,3438,29899,15987,20193,310,773,1438,716,17279,9401,304,13807,6743,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,752,7807,2980,363,278,671,310,4768,356,5105,519,17279,297,7632,29892,322,1009,20408,294,573,25078,526,13602,10106,278,12032,29889],"total_duration":56418864705,"load_duration":230633,"prompt_eval_count":284,"prompt_eval_duration":26206761000,"eval_count":240,"eval_duration":30211342000}
