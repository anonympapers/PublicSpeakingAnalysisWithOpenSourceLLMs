{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:07:05.701615142Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigorous reasoning. The speaker provides some convincing arguments and uses rhetorical devices to emphasize their points. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of vivid imagery and metaphors to paint a picture of the problem and the proposed solution. For example, the line \"Elle reste caché, accroché à ses petits bouts du tissu vegetal pour lesquelles elle a beaucoup d'un métier\" creates a clear image of the plant's attachment to its environment. Similarly, the use of repetition in the line \"Pour ensuite, la décrocher ou l'orande disponible et augmenter le rendement des fractions\" emphasizes the importance of the proposed solution.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported. For example, the speaker claims that their strategy is to \"par épartei, tout se pété de particules micro-metriques et identifées à quel taille est sous quel état physique,\" but it is not clear how this strategy will work or what specific steps the speaker will take to achieve their goals. Additionally, the speaker claims that their formula will \"enrich des saliments, faire des médicaments, et rendre au pédro,\" but it is not clear how these products will be produced or what specific benefits they will have.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some convincing arguments and uses effective rhetorical devices, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,5646,316,14419,29889,360,29915,14559,5541,743,29892,301,29915,609,10259,4211,29948,29889,8748,4191,4875,302,29915,29874,603,1506,15471,2331,18916,29892,782,13003,270,29915,1654,553,10890,29892,4875,18062,274,496,29948,29892,1035,307,11555,818,3999,5697,1169,289,17718,868,260,790,29884,18655,295,1671,966,339,4999,4875,263,21394,270,29915,348,11510,631,29889,315,29915,342,1750,286,29915,3451,30037,1173,316,301,29915,279,4582,786,29539,29889,3219,26742,2445,347,29892,274,29915,342,610,904,862,15314,29892,5646,409,282,7342,316,1936,2540,9200,29899,2527,374,1912,634,2893,361,2406,818,7594,260,8284,707,5898,7594,2852,271,4824,1387,29892,274,29915,342,7848,5278,302,29915,279,22094,269,29915,309,734,260,434,29889,6803,18158,29892,425,4224,307,4630,2123,301,29915,272,4182,26318,634,18765,261,454,19643,358,553,5227,1953,29889,1174,13495,29892,321,29882,6079,29892,980,454,592,18062,818,2298,439,29915,30001,425,14953,1318,29892,425,7063,29872,1671,427,4018,381,553,4497,7862,29892,9073,553,10283,293,20060,29892,634,7697,276,782,282,2487,307,29892,470,424,29889,1720,1671,336,16497,7608,966,6056,267,3479,4323,7719,553,553,923,1912,1750,1391,275,296,634,7890,17161,261,7890,9411,427,289,7293,20877,29948,29889,12167,2488,282,2487,307,29892,432,29915,1794,26099,18916,1671,260,29915,29881,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,20657,24481,29889,450,25657,8128,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,304,19310,675,1009,3291,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,325,3640,6382,708,322,1539,12451,943,304,10675,263,7623,310,278,1108,322,278,7972,1650,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,1196,376,6489,280,18062,274,496,29948,29892,1035,307,11555,818,3999,5697,1169,289,17718,868,260,790,29884,18655,284,1671,966,339,4999,4875,263,21394,270,29915,348,11510,631,29908,10017,263,2821,1967,310,278,8024,29915,29879,26305,304,967,5177,29889,20175,29892,278,671,310,21159,654,297,278,1196,376,29925,473,18158,29892,425,4224,307,4630,2123,301,29915,272,4182,26318,634,18765,261,454,19643,358,553,5227,1953,29908,19310,7093,278,13500,310,278,7972,1650,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,16726,393,1009,13705,338,304,376,862,904,862,15314,29892,5646,409,282,7342,316,1936,2540,9200,29899,2527,374,1912,634,2893,361,2406,818,7594,260,8284,707,5898,7594,2852,271,4824,1387,1699,541,372,338,451,2821,920,445,13705,674,664,470,825,2702,6576,278,25657,674,2125,304,6176,1009,14433,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,16726,393,1009,7063,674,376,264,4018,553,4497,7862,29892,9073,553,10283,293,20060,29892,634,7697,276,782,282,2487,307,1699,541,372,338,451,2821,920,1438,9316,674,367,7371,470,825,2702,23633,896,674,505,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,11828,364,9188,272,936,9224,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":72515402185,"load_duration":238808,"prompt_eval_count":269,"prompt_eval_duration":24354596000,"eval_count":379,"eval_duration":48160124000}
