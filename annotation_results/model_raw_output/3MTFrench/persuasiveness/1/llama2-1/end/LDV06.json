{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T17:13:45.057954418Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices and logic to present their argument, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker uses repetition (e.g., \"plus vous en apprenez et plus le mystère c'est PC\") and parallelism (e.g., \"Bonne idée, dernière indice\") to emphasize their points and make the speech more engaging. They also use rhetorical questions (e.g., \"Si l'on entier en pas compte, se últim code...\") to challenge the audience's assumptions and encourage them to consider alternative perspectives.\n\nHowever, there are some instances where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, their argument that the PLCB3 acts as a \"gatekeeper\" for CFTR could be further supported by scientific evidence or studies. Additionally, the speaker's conclusion that \"la PLCB3 acteable CFTR\" could be more clearly defined and explained.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's use of rhetorical devices and logic is effective in presenting their argument, there are areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous to make the speech even more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2298,7890,427,623,1267,6096,634,2298,454,16624,1908,274,29915,342,9609,29889,315,29915,342,18484,2257,712,373,409,6309,782,9587,316,425,266,17449,29889,350,7293,1178,1318,29892,24407,1399,625,29889,1551,452,8164,409,274,3960,29925,4986,29924,29892,7890,452,301,29915,1351,29920,2331,9201,6316,1314,29892,289,15356,276,29889,11323,29892,452,260,10281,2331,439,29915,265,302,29915,29891,2362,29874,29889,6101,301,29915,265,875,631,427,2331,16731,29892,409,16825,775,29892,7209,301,29915,404,309,519,29892,2362,29892,634,503,538,29892,29871,4277,18332,954,10651,1597,9406,882,297,24983,29892,954,10651,316,28185,9373,297,24983,634,954,10651,29871,29941,29892,274,29915,342,14344,29899,455,29889,6101,373,6896,2017,5646,29892,373,2062,27153,8997,454,13222,29892,454,289,2029,482,316,425,349,12182,29933,29941,3964,14150,425,5039,2131,270,29915,12107,29943,5659,29889,405,681,427,15997,29892,712,425,349,12182,29933,29941,1044,29872,519,17861,5659,29889,8748,274,29915,342,818,2257,3256,7175,3476,868,18308,712,425,14931,12507,12675,29889,1551,24684,1249,2656,381,1354,7890,28078,11867,29889,478,681,29871,22730,13220,29889,349,4664,7890,2852,26477,5573,267,634,7890,1791,6096,10440,23386,29899,29874,29899,19521,681,1473,267,29889,11948,452,7890,343,25063,14001,2331,29889,365,29915,264,1324,29884,316,611,266,17449,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,270,29915,279,3511,818,1601,21206,932,29948,29889,11948,6079,316,4224,6119,454,1472,482,553,3038,2540,9505,3712,7147,5478,2406,1671,454,17861,5659,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,322,5900,304,2198,1009,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3913,21159,654,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,11242,7890,427,623,1267,6096,634,2298,454,16624,1908,274,29915,342,9609,1159,322,8943,1608,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,29933,7293,1178,1318,29892,24407,1399,625,1159,304,19310,675,1009,3291,322,1207,278,12032,901,3033,6751,29889,2688,884,671,364,9188,272,936,5155,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,25598,301,29915,265,875,631,427,2331,16731,29892,409,9501,326,775,856,1159,304,18766,278,20026,29915,29879,20813,322,13731,6617,963,304,2050,8671,3736,1103,3145,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,8871,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,1009,2980,393,278,349,12182,29933,29941,14741,408,263,376,17062,23935,29908,363,17861,5659,1033,367,4340,6969,491,16021,10757,470,11898,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,15997,393,376,433,349,12182,29933,29941,1044,29872,519,17861,5659,29908,1033,367,901,9436,3342,322,10824,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,9224,322,5900,338,11828,297,2198,292,1009,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,304,1207,278,12032,1584,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":61943005808,"load_duration":266132,"prompt_eval_count":304,"prompt_eval_duration":25469992000,"eval_count":296,"eval_duration":36472243000}
