The speaker does an adequate job of presenting their argument and using examples to support their claims, but there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more convincing.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claim that the new systems of catalysis will be more efficient than the traditional ones. While they mention that the new systems will be able to integrate metals abundantly, they do not provide any specific examples or data to demonstrate this. Additionally, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or criticisms of their proposal, such as concerns about the cost or feasibility of implementing these new systems.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's use of language and tone can be improved to make their message more compelling. At times, they come across as dismissive or condescending towards existing research and theories, which can undermine their credibility and persuasiveness. For example, when they say \"il y a veces encore débat sur leur fonctionnement réel,\" they could have phrased it in a more neutral or constructive way to show that they are acknowledging the complexity of the issue.\n\nOverall, while the speaker has put forth a reasonable argument, they could benefit from more evidence and a more nuanced approach to persuading their audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,7890,27516,1597,5734,8376,29892,454,9073,274,29915,342,2684,882,29871,29953,29955,1644,1355,454,4679,29877,29889,341,5093,2331,1597,6316,1924,694,7608,347,29889,478,681,7199,10281,301,29915,524,1064,11992,16134,424,316,13942,29877,2496,316,10984,2993,13107,19503,316,274,532,895,332,1750,623,370,296,270,29915,524,27083,261,6366,562,882,7015,11510,2993,633,898,1934,29889,365,29915,264,1324,29884,707,19397,4313,30069,1358,7015,10984,2993,13107,19503,4280,267,634,274,29915,342,5646,454,541,316,611,266,17449,29889,1551,7890,14034,424,443,17887,7006,5646,29871,4277,29889,315,29915,342,4191,1354,29892,980,343,427,17792,29892,432,29915,28899,275,454,286,585,1564,275,7877,14785,1750,3686,388,1249,316,5614,631,1190,1487,17887,3949,279,1943,1671,11469,1597,289,7293,14033,371,29889,11948,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,1487,3949,279,1943,29892,425,4768,5458,29892,263,301,29915,4582,768,2428,2428,2428,4439,29889,29871,30219,29874,5246,553,270,466,13116,634,553,270,466,13116,270,29915,812,2406,712,7015,427,14022,267,3435,2852,4749,743,634,980,343,263,29202,10440,1437,10222,1190,6267,18165,17239,1841,295,29889,2581,19760,12866,19397,4313,30069,1358,610,5444,17334,4883,17246,895,1295,1671,15237,966,626,15817,9386,634,5152,29539,443,8694,966,8689,29892,17055,7608,2123,6701,1437,3364,261,966,6316,1314,3184,1379,1302,30095,371,1314,29889,11948,1354,611,266,17449,611,623,3780,21907,12784,29892,274,29915,342,439,29915,309,707,4100,316,19397,23532,868,1162,352,634,4880,261,19449,439,29915,309,409,21714,1465,966,5697,3246,3209,344,260,29915,562,30069,6772,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,385,19967,339,403,4982,310,2198,292,1009,2980,322,773,6455,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,896,1033,11157,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,5995,393,278,716,6757,310,17246,4848,674,367,901,8543,1135,278,13807,6743,29889,5806,896,3585,393,278,716,6757,674,367,2221,304,22782,1539,1338,18666,10835,29892,896,437,451,3867,738,2702,6455,470,848,304,22222,445,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,20976,7037,6795,25699,470,11164,12903,310,1009,24963,29892,1316,408,21838,1048,278,3438,470,28326,4127,310,16049,1438,716,6757,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,4086,322,16225,508,367,16710,304,1207,1009,2643,901,752,7807,29889,2180,3064,29892,896,2041,4822,408,18918,573,470,2148,9977,2548,7113,5923,5925,322,25841,29892,607,508,563,837,457,1009,6625,4127,322,20408,294,20193,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,896,1827,376,309,343,263,24063,10440,1437,10222,1190,6267,18165,17239,1841,295,1699,896,1033,505,12216,1463,372,297,263,901,21104,470,3386,573,982,304,1510,393,896,526,24084,3460,278,13644,310,278,2228,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,756,1925,11483,263,15590,2980,29892,896,1033,14169,515,901,10757,322,263,901,4948,8362,2948,304,20408,9382,1009,20026,29889],"total_duration":69783446345,"load_duration":225313,"prompt_eval_count":326,"prompt_eval_duration":29999581000,"eval_count":297,"eval_duration":39781837000}
