{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T16:29:18.429535459Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's ability to craft a persuasive message. The speaker provides some logical reasoning and evidence to support their claims, but there are also some areas where their argument could be improved. Here are some specific points:\n\n1. The speaker's use of technical terms and scientific jargon may be perceived as exclusive or alienating to some listeners who may not be familiar with these concepts. A more inclusive approach could be to provide simpler explanations and examples to help audience members understand the science behind the claims.\n2. While the speaker provides some evidence from their research, they could benefit from providing more specific data and statistics to support their claims. This would help to build credibility and make the argument more convincing.\n3. The speaker's argument relies heavily on the idea that reducing COD through cement production is a significant factor in reducing the carbon footprint of the building sector. However, there may be other factors at play that could impact this equation, such as the use of alternative materials or building designs that reduce energy consumption. A more comprehensive analysis could consider these additional factors and their potential impact on the overall carbon footprint of the sector.\n4. The speaker's conclusion that \"la contribution que j'aurais apporté, et la possibilité\" (the contribution I would have made, and the possibility) feels somewhat abrupt and unresolved. A more satisfying conclusion could provide a clearer sense of how the speaker's research or proposal could be implemented in practice, or how it could lead to further developments or innovations in the field.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the speaker's argument could be improved, their use of logical reasoning and evidence to support their claims is a strength of the speech. With some refinements and additional details, the speaker could make an even more persuasive case for reducing COD through cement production.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,553,10329,30058,4515,270,29915,2249,324,654,29892,14924,316,1841,700,533,301,29915,25049,6693,1559,15933,868,21149,5411,868,350,3557,29889,2581,286,29915,4548,9854,29889,19551,316,425,5802,316,274,2073,29892,454,1208,18020,409,1437,19438,427,15835,398,634,427,4810,29928,29889,1394,29892,980,18062,868,15835,398,270,29915,348,946,5705,1908,24502,29948,29892,634,427,966,14060,1934,4810,29928,29892,980,263,2656,270,29915,1131,332,27751,634,454,2930,15532,427,11736,424,868,1208,18020,29889,11948,1444,19760,7890,1029,283,261,439,29915,309,707,9577,2923,25123,316,2930,29948,914,5646,454,4810,29928,1750,263,4370,3984,7628,316,425,5802,316,274,2073,29889,315,29915,342,18916,425,9460,316,611,266,17449,29889,6340,1136,2488,818,1437,18821,261,425,4323,2131,316,4810,29928,712,966,8310,3163,24502,743,564,374,794,818,282,29915,29886,4087,29889,435,29915,29891,7468,5291,6309,454,1889,375,20674,1387,875,661,1173,1314,427,16623,424,21394,316,4883,1973,1465,1601,10212,20141,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,432,29915,29874,326,1572,275,7890,760,1875,443,5246,25235,11468,27153,29889,2866,336,19211,2257,439,29915,265,301,29915,290,1030,707,8182,533,29892,29871,29896,12118,316,5697,293,263,8066,782,11412,29892,6425,2016,2298,316,4810,29928,29892,13545,301,29915,18288,26379,5777,453,13375,29889,315,29915,342,610,346,712,966,5697,293,263,8066,429,1129,19047,316,7101,4810,29928,29892,7006,1014,29948,2298,7209,29889,11948,270,29915,348,4883,12242,743,1190,13310,4883,17124,6609,29892,425,11896,712,432,29915,6698,1759,623,441,29948,29892,634,425,27829,2131,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,11509,304,25554,263,20408,294,573,2643,29889,450,25657,8128,777,16667,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,1009,2980,1033,367,16710,29889,2266,526,777,2702,3291,29901,13,13,29896,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,671,310,16905,4958,322,16021,432,1191,265,1122,367,17189,2347,408,29192,470,394,819,1218,304,777,11621,414,1058,1122,451,367,9985,411,1438,22001,29889,319,901,20978,573,2948,1033,367,304,3867,13682,7309,800,322,6455,304,1371,20026,5144,2274,278,10466,5742,278,16726,29889,13,29906,29889,5806,278,25657,8128,777,10757,515,1009,5925,29892,896,1033,14169,515,13138,901,2702,848,322,13964,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,910,723,1371,304,2048,6625,4127,322,1207,278,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,13,29941,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2980,337,3687,20365,373,278,2969,393,27668,4810,29928,1549,274,882,5802,338,263,7282,7329,297,27668,278,22004,3661,2158,310,278,5214,17535,29889,2398,29892,727,1122,367,916,13879,472,1708,393,1033,10879,445,6306,29892,1316,408,278,671,310,8671,17279,470,5214,25517,393,10032,5864,27430,29889,319,901,15171,6270,7418,1033,2050,1438,5684,13879,322,1009,7037,10879,373,278,12463,22004,3661,2158,310,278,17535,29889,13,29946,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,15997,393,376,433,11896,712,432,29915,6698,1759,623,441,29948,29892,634,425,27829,2131,29908,313,1552,11896,306,723,505,1754,29892,322,278,13331,29897,23880,10579,633,6685,322,443,9778,1490,29889,319,901,24064,15997,1033,3867,263,26135,4060,310,920,278,25657,29915,29879,5925,470,24963,1033,367,8762,297,6944,29892,470,920,372,1033,3275,304,4340,2693,1860,470,24233,800,297,278,1746,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,1033,367,16710,29892,1009,671,310,16667,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,338,263,9324,310,278,12032,29889,2973,777,2143,262,4110,322,5684,4902,29892,278,25657,1033,1207,385,1584,901,20408,294,573,1206,363,27668,4810,29928,1549,274,882,5802,29889],"total_duration":83391213627,"load_duration":159247,"prompt_eval_count":321,"prompt_eval_duration":29427195000,"eval_count":421,"eval_duration":53963285000}
