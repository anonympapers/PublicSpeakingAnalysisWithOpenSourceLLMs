{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T19:57:41.258118582Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness and rigor in their reasoning. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, using evidence from their analysis of 600,000 text documents to support their claim that there is a significant number of potential patients who have not been accounted for in medical history. They also provide a detailed plan for how they could use this information to develop profiles for different pathologies and treatments, which would allow them to easily identify and orient new patients towards the most appropriate treatment.\n\nThe speaker's use of data and statistics to support their argument adds credibility and weight to their claims, and their proposal for a \"version 2.0\" of precision medicine is an innovative and compelling idea. However, the speaker does not provide any direct counterarguments or challenges to their own proposal, which could have strengthened their argument further.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a well-reasoned and persuasive argument, but could benefit from a more nuanced analysis of potential criticisms and limitations of their proposal.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,782,977,273,297,1131,295,29889,8748,29871,4277,29892,274,4727,1249,19601,2257,16933,3058,882,9577,1411,818,659,631,29889,8748,1465,1601,714,309,29892,432,29915,1794,4021,29792,29871,4277,316,289,2035,371,25406,2131,29889,435,29915,1794,5246,1597,16455,344,316,7015,5614,631,784,4237,1190,29871,29953,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1426,267,29892,634,432,29915,1794,24889,29948,712,29871,29896,29995,316,7015,10701,16474,2406,427,289,2035,371,25406,2131,29889,8292,262,1318,818,4883,27965,1314,29871,29896,29900,14746,316,10701,29892,29871,4277,5246,16573,316,29871,29896,29900,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,1426,267,1750,3435,3104,296,18029,1098,5326,610,2257,289,2035,29889,3872,29883,274,29915,342,12866,443,4768,1803,4655,818,23532,427,16731,7628,316,425,17789,4080,316,26814,298,6844,10283,28148,29889,10016,10098,712,1444,724,1794,15390,316,9073,29871,4277,29892,1444,1671,23469,1437,4951,381,553,20077,4072,610,2224,11763,634,818,2257,712,274,29915,342,818,553,1020,667,1237,29889,422,1004,29871,4277,29892,18097,443,13164,15935,29876,564,3511,29874,29892,1444,1671,23469,2258,455,944,7769,261,427,3911,977,424,966,1020,667,1237,1750,724,609,1027,4233,533,5695,29889,3872,29883,18097,6896,398,29948,23068,818,325,359,21880,29892,1209,29948,634,22847,29892,8556,29231,453,787,1671,454,3105,332,29892,425,1873,29871,29906,29889,29900,316,425,25974,457,316,16784,2459,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29946,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,297,1009,24481,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,773,10757,515,1009,7418,310,29871,29953,29900,29900,29892,29900,29900,29900,1426,10701,304,2304,1009,5995,393,727,338,263,7282,1353,310,7037,22069,1058,505,451,1063,3633,287,363,297,16083,4955,29889,2688,884,3867,263,13173,3814,363,920,896,1033,671,445,2472,304,2693,28723,363,1422,2224,11763,322,7539,1860,29892,607,723,2758,963,304,5948,12439,322,7769,716,22069,7113,278,1556,8210,14502,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,848,322,13964,304,2304,1009,2980,12778,6625,4127,322,7688,304,1009,16726,29892,322,1009,24963,363,263,376,3259,29871,29906,29889,29900,29908,310,16716,26602,338,385,24233,1230,322,752,7807,2969,29889,2398,29892,278,25657,947,451,3867,738,1513,6795,25699,470,18066,267,304,1009,1914,24963,29892,607,1033,505,9324,6419,1009,2980,4340,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,22981,263,1532,29899,23147,287,322,20408,294,573,2980,29892,541,1033,14169,515,263,901,4948,8362,7418,310,7037,11164,12903,322,27028,310,1009,24963,29889],"total_duration":56217126441,"load_duration":142908,"prompt_eval_count":280,"prompt_eval_duration":25252068000,"eval_count":244,"eval_duration":30964381000}
