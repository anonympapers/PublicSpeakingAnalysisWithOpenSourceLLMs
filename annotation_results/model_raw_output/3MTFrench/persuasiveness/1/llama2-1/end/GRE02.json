{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T07:23:46.311927194Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the speaker's persuasiveness in crafting a convincing message. The speaker seems to have a good understanding of their topic and presents several arguments to support their thesis. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFirstly, the speaker occasionally uses vague language and generalizations, which can make it difficult to evaluate the strength of their arguments. For example, they mention \"il y a une idée\" and \"mutualiser l'information\" without providing specific examples or evidence to support these claims. Additionally, the speaker's use of multiple cameras is not fully explained, and it is unclear how they plan to integrate the information from these cameras to create a comprehensive understanding of their topic.\n\nSecondly, while the speaker provides some details about their thesis, such as the three disciplines involved, they do not provide a clear and detailed outline of their argumentation. This makes it difficult to assess the coherence and consistency of their reasoning.\n\nFinally, the speaker's use of the phrase \"je suis le juge des caméras\" suggests a lack of objectivity in their evaluation of the data. While it is important for speakers to be confident in their arguments, they should also be open to considering alternative perspectives and evidence.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some potential in presenting their argument, there are areas where they could improve their reasoning and provide more detail and support for their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2535,553,3949,1064,294,2123,29875,3503,25178,3949,1064,294,432,29915,4422,895,553,3949,1064,294,427,5227,28754,634,432,29915,264,4422,895,10741,2245,16105,29892,274,29915,342,3949,1064,294,19172,296,316,8689,427,2600,13469,332,980,343,263,1597,1178,1318,634,316,21736,1089,316,5478,950,7608,301,29915,19678,316,7015,3949,1064,294,269,4987,712,18402,3949,1064,294,992,309,30001,425,22259,2131,1465,7814,12694,1237,454,452,325,609,443,13137,316,409,7697,276,5537,264,29892,301,29915,18288,316,409,7697,276,5537,264,634,454,13137,707,443,17887,7006,1437,689,29948,1444,26099,454,3623,479,553,3949,1064,294,1444,16133,1908,966,6910,316,18402,1597,270,29915,14056,20554,1444,544,1975,553,11486,634,1444,1437,1982,1908,1190,425,1873,13149,744,425,2298,325,336,347,269,13365,519,289,999,1444,1539,29879,316,301,29915,19809,1465,7015,21880,611,266,17449,752,10069,29871,29941,17119,1475,6299,1166,2122,1750,592,260,23510,818,274,16581,425,8861,29892,425,385,8678,347,1750,14924,316,6628,1314,7199,9030,24145,14913,425,18768,29892,454,1020,17334,270,29915,3027,1750,14924,3479,22420,14075,316,8689,24145,9122,634,425,24407,29892,425,2298,26436,270,29915,14056,20554,425,349,2487,13247,347,29892,14344,1750,14924,454,760,482,868,4048,6390,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,2444,304,505,263,1781,8004,310,1009,11261,322,22981,3196,6273,304,2304,1009,266,6656,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,23025,3913,25160,4086,322,2498,17063,29892,607,508,1207,372,5189,304,14707,278,9324,310,1009,6273,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,3585,376,309,343,263,1597,1178,1318,29908,322,376,6149,950,7608,301,29915,19678,29908,1728,13138,2702,6455,470,10757,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,2999,3949,18464,338,451,8072,10824,29892,322,372,338,20871,920,896,3814,304,22782,278,2472,515,1438,3949,18464,304,1653,263,15171,6270,8004,310,1009,11261,29889,13,13,11863,368,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,4902,1048,1009,266,6656,29892,1316,408,278,2211,17119,1475,9701,29892,896,437,451,3867,263,2821,322,13173,27887,310,1009,2980,362,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,24809,278,16165,261,663,322,5718,3819,310,1009,24481,29889,13,13,12881,635,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,278,16549,376,1324,26099,454,3623,479,553,3949,1064,294,29908,14661,263,10225,310,1203,2068,297,1009,17983,310,278,848,29889,5806,372,338,4100,363,7726,414,304,367,24332,297,1009,6273,29892,896,881,884,367,1722,304,13858,8671,3736,1103,3145,322,10757,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,7037,297,2198,292,1009,2980,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,1009,24481,322,3867,901,9493,322,2304,363,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":65700268682,"load_duration":159121,"prompt_eval_count":259,"prompt_eval_duration":23342910000,"eval_count":331,"eval_duration":42356736000}
