The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as metaphors (e.g., \"basard\" and \"tave lure\") to explain complex concepts in a creative and engaging way. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that they are developing both the \"solution matérielle\" and the necessary algorithms, but it is not entirely clear how these will work together or what specific benefits they will provide. Additionally, the speaker mentions that their method can \"récupère cette information sur la déviation de Jureille-Yon X,\" but it is not clear how this information will be used or what kind of results the speaker is expecting to obtain.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some creativity and flair in their argumentation, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-defined.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,4546,29875,1671,611,266,17449,29892,1444,1539,29879,454,2362,538,760,449,29889,7747,2362,538,29892,427,1967,10681,29892,427,16794,29871,4277,29892,868,9922,5338,29889,15113,7175,3476,15471,29892,432,29915,4422,895,868,9922,5338,316,260,1351,301,545,29889,6803,6628,1314,7604,7608,29892,274,29915,342,443,17887,7006,4191,425,452,2231,1190,425,13745,29892,18097,373,452,20531,1173,2331,301,29915,6381,457,29889,6803,966,2298,427,455,575,270,29915,14056,7890,29889,3872,29883,1444,325,1759,868,2362,538,443,17887,7006,760,449,29892,3503,4191,1444,26099,1597,2902,371,427,9982,19809,29889,8748,6079,29892,1444,325,1759,19397,9577,29892,9577,2258,455,944,1634,29539,3440,409,9982,19809,634,409,9922,5338,29889,8748,878,3709,29892,18097,454,15570,265,1060,29370,425,1775,5289,29889,1174,13495,29892,5844,2249,2219,339,882,29892,2535,966,3093,3751,4467,712,1444,13942,29877,4798,29892,634,6079,1444,1841,5231,1908,5278,2472,1190,425,1437,14641,316,435,545,1924,29899,29979,265,1060,29892,22874,1318,639,700,29889,3185,27751,29892,1444,13942,29877,4798,818,425,10098,425,1650,1775,4894,1808,634,966,3093,3751,4467,16253,7147,29889,435,29915,1794,8648,2653,1601,509,261,712,966,6896,19718,439,29915,265,14403,993,443,301,459,2410,23068,782,16724,432,29915,326,4220,29892,3435,269,13365,1849,782,6896,499,271,439,29915,265,3523,29877,302,1318,782,29580,26379,29899,509,283,29889,3872,29883,29892,1671,611,266,17449,29892,1444,1539,29879,868,2362,538,760,449,29889,435,29915,279,4401,818,1841,5231,29539,1597,2472,439,29915,265,8164,427,7019,11113,276,29889,11948,26154,29892,432,29915,1794,1597,5566,1509,1671,452,2298,364,4600,4883,2756,7147,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,1539,12451,943,313,29872,29889,29887,1696,376,6500,538,29908,322,376,941,345,301,545,1159,304,5649,4280,22001,297,263,907,1230,322,3033,6751,982,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,896,526,14338,1716,278,376,2929,918,1775,4894,1808,29908,322,278,5181,14009,29892,541,372,338,451,9186,2821,920,1438,674,664,4208,470,825,2702,23633,896,674,3867,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,26649,393,1009,1158,508,376,29878,4582,786,1908,5278,2472,1190,425,1437,14641,316,435,545,1924,29899,29979,265,1060,1699,541,372,338,451,2821,920,445,2472,674,367,1304,470,825,2924,310,2582,278,25657,338,16120,304,4017,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,3697,777,907,28157,322,17422,381,297,1009,2980,362,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,12119,29889],"total_duration":59334932487,"load_duration":224658,"prompt_eval_count":336,"prompt_eval_duration":30626093000,"eval_count":221,"eval_duration":28708135000}
