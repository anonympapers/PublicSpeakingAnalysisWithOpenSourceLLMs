{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T05:36:35.76379726Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some convincing arguments and uses logical reasoning to support their claims. However, there are some areas where the argumentation could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker's use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios helps to engage the audience and make the topic more relatable. For example, when the speaker asks \"Pour vérifier cette idée, les gérgardés des embryons qui ont une mutation génétique et qui ne forme pas d'œil, et j'ai vu que sur ces embryons, les neurones de la narine n'avance pas,\" they are able to illustrate their point in a more memorable and impactful way.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could have used more rigorous reasoning. For example, when the speaker states that \"Alors, au-delà de la narine du poisson zèbre, mieux comprendre le rôle des forces mécaniques au cours du développement, apportera un nouvel éclairage sur les maladies du système nerveux,\" they are relying on a rather simplistic analogy. A more rigorous approach would have involved providing more specific examples of how understanding the mechanical forces involved in development could lead to new insights into neurological disorders.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments, there are areas where they could have used more rigorous reasoning and evidence to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,425,6701,12784,1671,966,26808,2873,316,425,17655,457,29889,1551,282,1947,712,2257,3435,966,20396,2540,316,301,29915,30106,309,1750,409,7845,993,427,6808,681,29892,1750,260,533,966,26808,2873,316,425,17655,457,1190,454,21384,29892,9953,743,1465,425,1472,291,17239,316,6267,3158,29892,610,346,439,29915,1808,707,454,409,4511,29872,2535,454,5147,345,585,29889,6803,325,1064,3709,5278,1178,1318,29892,966,330,1064,29887,538,743,553,7232,719,787,1750,4625,1597,5478,362,6094,19971,634,1750,452,13618,2331,270,29915,30106,309,29892,634,432,29915,1794,18679,712,1190,7015,7232,719,787,29892,966,26808,2873,316,425,17655,457,302,29915,485,749,2331,29889,315,29915,342,6896,499,271,325,993,12388,1050,24145,13752,17449,14864,22025,966,20396,2540,316,301,29915,30106,309,260,533,29892,966,26808,2873,316,425,17655,457,634,7629,276,439,29915,309,302,29915,29891,263,2331,712,966,6062,29948,21337,20674,1475,1750,3435,24151,782,9587,868,24305,29892,3503,5695,966,8249,8774,3068,3783,29889,838,943,29892,782,29899,6144,30001,316,425,17655,457,868,772,17387,503,30000,1030,29892,6628,1314,7199,9030,454,17889,553,8249,8774,3068,3783,782,9587,868,24305,29892,623,9555,29874,443,302,9095,904,16398,3055,479,1190,966,4439,328,583,868,21423,302,7143,1314,29889,838,943,29892,712,425,4889,269,29915,14975,2003,289,7293,316,364,21522,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,3913,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6730,368,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,13752,300,936,21846,6911,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,1207,278,11261,901,1104,17219,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,278,25657,19514,376,29925,473,325,1064,3709,5278,1178,1318,29892,966,330,1064,29887,538,743,553,7232,719,787,1750,4625,1597,5478,362,6094,19971,634,1750,452,13618,2331,270,29915,30106,309,29892,634,432,29915,1794,18679,712,1190,7015,7232,719,787,29892,966,26808,2873,316,425,17655,457,302,29915,485,749,2331,1699,896,526,2221,304,28475,1009,1298,297,263,901,26959,519,322,10879,1319,982,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,505,1304,901,12912,20657,24481,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,278,25657,5922,393,376,2499,943,29892,782,29899,6144,30001,316,425,17655,457,868,772,17387,503,30000,1030,29892,6628,1314,7199,9030,454,17889,553,8249,8774,3068,3783,782,9587,868,24305,29892,623,9555,29874,443,302,9095,904,16398,3055,479,1190,966,4439,328,583,868,21423,302,7143,1314,1699,896,526,337,5890,373,263,3265,5466,4695,3483,6933,29889,319,901,12912,20657,2948,723,505,9701,13138,901,2702,6455,310,920,8004,278,28310,8249,9701,297,5849,1033,3275,304,716,1663,5861,964,452,2192,1188,936,766,20488,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,505,1304,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":69327434462,"load_duration":174972,"prompt_eval_count":282,"prompt_eval_duration":25551681000,"eval_count":345,"eval_duration":43775164000}
