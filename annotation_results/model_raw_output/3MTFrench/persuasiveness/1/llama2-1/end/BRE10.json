The speaker does an effective job of using rhetorical questions and observations to engage their audience and make them feel at ease. However, the reasoning presented is not particularly rigorous or well-supported by evidence.\n\nThe speaker uses a conversational tone and makes use of colloquial expressions, such as \"charcita\" and \"d'un,\" which helps to create a sense of intimacy and connection with the audience. They also use body language and facial expressions to convey their message, which adds to the overall impact of the speech.\n\nHowever, the speaker's arguments are largely based on anecdotal evidence and personal observations, rather than any systematic or scientific analysis. For example, they claim that being in nature can help people feel more relaxed and free, but do not provide any empirical evidence to support this claim. Similarly, their observation that some individuals bronzant before going to the beach is not particularly relevant to the overall argument about the benefits of nature.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does a good job of engaging their audience and creating a persuasive atmosphere, the lack of rigorous reasoning and evidence limits the effectiveness of their argument.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,1661,29892,7890,302,29915,22730,2331,2025,6311,13220,29889,365,29915,267,3535,5246,29202,316,7890,2257,439,29915,309,2453,329,29889,1174,7890,5820,424,29892,7890,286,29915,1351,29920,623,3780,1373,28805,270,29915,348,29892,10741,521,15806,1190,7015,1095,307,1169,13180,1601,22085,9061,29889,478,681,286,29915,1351,29920,623,3780,610,17488,712,553,7877,29948,1860,316,5796,415,545,2535,301,29915,21813,17239,23499,475,29892,260,1808,712,425,285,5903,2487,362,29892,425,29845,270,29915,1540,282,2016,2123,425,12694,663,316,19666,29892,7890,263,1241,29874,7890,1104,30057,305,1572,443,8441,29889,435,29915,1794,7199,275,712,301,29915,14531,7890,27516,1597,4771,362,553,658,647,4110,5695,6079,5829,3783,712,1998,2491,29892,1750,7890,263,1241,29874,7890,4303,29539,29889,11948,432,29915,1794,5695,4370,5227,407,29948,610,966,14231,285,2905,1169,610,23563,270,29915,14056,7890,1671,7175,862,261,6267,14913,270,29915,7342,427,12246,29920,424,10042,270,29915,12572,818,301,29915,485,11710,482,29889,1174,5646,3209,29892,4883,29881,1280,634,4473,8894,29892,18097,7890,29871,22730,1190,7015,5152,3302,29899,27048,29892,269,1829,29920,712,1444,7890,14111,29889,1551,301,29915,29874,9820,20141,818,19601,634,6079,29892,274,29915,342,7890,29889,2581,14387,1082,454,2730,19844,316,7890,25924,29889,2581,7890,330,9061,29889,8748,29202,29892,1444,3516,575,270,29915,29891,885,3155,261,2535,7890,1671,7199,9030,2257,1750,7890,5246,2665,381,29892,29871,1654,2298,274,29915,29895,388,5411,29892,13220,316,7890,1104,30057,4630,29892,634,316,27962,427,13545,6233,2123,13545,3948,11992,743,316,325,359,3438,9351,316,18848,10042,611,1924,1314,316,10814,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,385,11828,4982,310,773,364,9188,272,936,5155,322,13917,304,3033,482,1009,20026,322,1207,963,4459,472,16326,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,9132,338,451,10734,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3913,263,9678,1288,16225,322,3732,671,310,784,417,339,616,12241,29892,1316,408,376,3090,28805,29908,322,376,29881,29915,348,1699,607,6911,304,1653,263,4060,310,938,326,4135,322,3957,411,278,20026,29889,2688,884,671,3573,4086,322,2258,1455,12241,304,27769,1009,2643,29892,607,12778,304,278,12463,10879,310,278,12032,29889,13,13,17245,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,526,18425,2729,373,385,687,6333,284,10757,322,7333,13917,29892,3265,1135,738,1788,2454,470,16021,7418,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,5995,393,1641,297,5469,508,1371,2305,4459,901,26681,287,322,3889,29892,541,437,451,3867,738,29190,936,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,20175,29892,1009,15500,393,777,15724,12246,29920,424,1434,2675,304,278,25695,338,451,10734,8018,304,278,12463,2980,1048,278,23633,310,5469,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,3033,6751,1009,20026,322,4969,263,20408,294,573,25005,29892,278,10225,310,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,13071,278,2779,20193,310,1009,2980,29889],"total_duration":67244359812,"load_duration":233829,"prompt_eval_count":332,"prompt_eval_duration":30815103000,"eval_count":279,"eval_duration":36428493000}
