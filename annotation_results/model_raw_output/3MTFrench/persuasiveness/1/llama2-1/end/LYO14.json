{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T09:10:15.770674385Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents some interesting insights and data to support their argument, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of specific examples and data to illustrate the points being made. For instance, the speaker provides data on the number of business failures in France over the past year, as well as the profiles of entrepreneurs who have gone through bankruptcy. This helps to make the argument more concrete and relatable for the audience.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, the speaker makes a claim that faillites d'entreprise ne mettent pas en faillite nos inégalités soient, but this claim is not fully supported by the data provided. While it is true that some entrepreneurs who have gone through bankruptcy may experience difficulties in the future, there is no explicit evidence presented to support the idea that this is always the case.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker could benefit from providing more context and background information on the topic of business failures. While they provide some interesting insights, the overall argument could be strengthened by more fully establishing the relevance and importance of the topic.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some strengths in terms of its use of specific examples and data, there are also areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2637,7734,29892,1444,652,23469,439,29915,309,263,443,21384,443,7006,611,2258,453,568,427,29871,29896,29947,29900,1473,267,29892,992,4099,29920,29892,7732,6233,634,301,29915,14056,7734,707,15617,680,29889,8748,980,343,263,5695,454,25915,6722,966,4239,17756,5908,2980,267,2535,966,349,2303,868,3114,1147,333,1387,29892,1601,2637,7734,316,8280,29886,291,7183,818,2258,453,568,29892,818,4556,553,29871,29896,29900,29871,29900,29900,29900,4224,2093,316,11387,427,3444,301,29915,18704,24407,29889,8748,7847,29892,432,29915,1794,19445,18402,7105,271,316,301,29915,513,3640,29884,30000,29880,29892,432,29915,1794,7019,5734,29948,634,432,29915,1794,4880,29948,12694,1237,13879,29892,4191,454,7916,29872,868,26745,424,2123,10440,1487,20067,2470,6351,9139,29889,8748,432,29915,1794,6787,277,2257,439,29915,265,8164,16794,29948,553,20077,29879,4072,316,2258,453,568,270,29915,14056,7734,29889,1459,17488,29892,427,5820,424,966,20067,2470,1400,29899,5444,453,583,553,26745,1934,29892,432,29915,1794,2653,8689,454,20077,316,301,29915,14056,558,1600,332,443,8694,23440,1600,332,15237,270,29915,18560,270,29915,348,7483,5264,904,2608,29948,282,20342,29892,782,20077,29871,29941,29928,29892,29871,29941,29928,1671,25074,346,29892,1437,2590,634,17631,9373,316,13181,273,29889,350,999,29892,782,2186,2535,4883,6896,19718,29889,8748,6079,274,29915,342,443,13164,521,392,24209,344,712,432,29915,1794,2123,1765,1190,966,2258,453,3246,270,29915,14056,7734,427,1601,509,424,712,966,2258,453,3246,270,29915,14056,7734,452,1539,29873,296,2331,427,2258,453,568,29892,7814,297,2445,284,7719,577,993,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,1663,5861,322,848,304,2304,1009,2980,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,2702,6455,322,848,304,28475,278,3291,1641,1754,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,8128,848,373,278,1353,310,5381,4418,1973,297,3444,975,278,4940,1629,29892,408,1532,408,278,28723,310,23440,1600,1295,1058,505,7695,1549,9124,6685,1270,29889,910,6911,304,1207,278,2980,901,18387,322,1104,17219,363,278,20026,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,393,2258,453,3246,270,29915,14056,7734,452,1539,29873,296,2331,427,2258,453,568,7814,297,2445,284,7719,577,993,29892,541,445,5995,338,451,8072,6969,491,278,848,4944,29889,5806,372,338,1565,393,777,23440,1600,1295,1058,505,7695,1549,9124,6685,1270,1122,7271,23553,297,278,5434,29892,727,338,694,6261,10757,9132,304,2304,278,2969,393,445,338,2337,278,1206,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,1033,14169,515,13138,901,3030,322,3239,2472,373,278,11261,310,5381,4418,1973,29889,5806,896,3867,777,8031,1663,5861,29892,278,12463,2980,1033,367,9324,6419,491,901,8072,10127,292,278,29527,749,322,13500,310,278,11261,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,756,777,9324,29879,297,4958,310,967,671,310,2702,6455,322,848,29892,727,526,884,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889],"total_duration":72539748088,"load_duration":182836,"prompt_eval_count":322,"prompt_eval_duration":29955856000,"eval_count":331,"eval_duration":42583315000}
