The speaker is trying to convince the audience that their research on the impact of environmental factors on fetal brain development is important and should be taken seriously. However, the argument is not particularly compelling or well-supported.\n\nThe speaker mentions some potential risks associated with exposure to certain substances during pregnancy, but they do not provide any concrete evidence or data to support their claims. They also rely heavily on vague statements about \"the environment\" and \"sources of haute qualit√©,\" which are not particularly specific or measurable.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of rhetorical questions (\"But today, what we need to retain...\") and overly simplistic phrasing (\"sauver le fenouillent de demain dans notre assiette.\") comes across as somewhat patronizing or manipulative.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's intentions may be good, their argument is not particularly persuasive or well-supported, and could benefit from more concrete evidence and a more rigorous approach to reasoning.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,478,681,454,4078,29920,29892,7890,29892,1559,443,289,10126,29948,3165,475,29892,818,1302,5411,553,752,29948,841,778,4771,261,709,29892,270,29915,1808,439,25054,5000,17478,29892,634,6079,19601,29892,1444,872,275,29892,634,316,7199,9030,18097,289,10126,29948,18371,283,453,296,818,1302,5411,29892,425,11101,2131,818,330,29539,29889,8396,29892,4191,9411,966,10814,544,271,1654,575,316,1601,16151,29892,818,21714,29899,280,29899,29883,496,300,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,8648,1190,301,29915,5819,3146,8146,316,6316,29892,3503,3105,332,29892,611,767,29888,1690,347,29892,7890,4078,29920,29892,966,5855,9577,2665,296,818,10019,1524,4191,454,4434,271,2123,301,29915,284,1111,324,1750,1671,8356,7848,4948,533,3479,5434,289,10126,29948,29889,8748,6079,19601,29892,1444,286,29915,524,29948,23458,1190,7594,3435,966,5855,9577,2665,296,316,301,29915,21813,17239,1750,1671,8356,2411,5761,454,289,10126,29948,18371,283,453,296,29889,365,29915,24031,316,7015,6896,19718,592,19172,8356,316,544,2487,381,553,289,787,5178,2719,818,4883,22069,316,4832,1936,14549,5908,29892,3503,8648,316,544,2487,381,2123,316,7175,7869,553,4439,689,800,316,8182,9948,868,1374,1690,290,8146,29889,11948,22572,29915,15669,29892,2257,439,29915,309,21668,337,841,381,29892,274,29915,342,712,4883,6896,19718,3348,631,609,818,16219,381,553,8974,316,447,1082,4021,2131,29892,5646,427,1391,275,424,782,2298,925,29872,427,3390,424,301,29915,21813,17239,634,301,29915,21708,29892,3503,26154,1671,7890,2257,29627,29892,2257,439,29915,309,21668,337,841,381,29892,274,29915,342,316,12507,369,454,18371,283,453,296,316,1261,475,1465,24145,408,1039,2353,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,20408,294,20193,322,12912,272,310,24481,29889,450,25657,338,1811,304,7602,1239,278,20026,393,1009,5925,373,278,10879,310,29380,13879,373,285,26310,17294,5849,338,4100,322,881,367,4586,25798,29889,2398,29892,278,2980,338,451,10734,752,7807,470,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,1576,25657,26649,777,7037,5161,2039,6942,411,14060,545,304,3058,5960,2925,2645,758,5138,6906,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,738,18387,10757,470,848,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,2688,884,19104,20365,373,25160,9506,1048,376,1552,5177,29908,322,376,29879,2863,310,447,1082,4021,2131,1699,607,526,451,10734,2702,470,7540,21115,29889,13,13,2528,17658,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,671,310,364,9188,272,936,5155,4852,6246,9826,29892,825,591,817,304,11551,856,1159,322,975,368,5466,4695,12216,5832,4852,29879,585,369,454,18371,283,453,296,316,1261,475,1465,24145,408,1039,2353,23157,5304,4822,408,10579,18259,5281,470,11525,28524,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,29915,29879,7609,1080,1122,367,1781,29892,1009,2980,338,451,10734,20408,294,573,470,1532,29899,23765,29892,322,1033,14169,515,901,18387,10757,322,263,901,12912,20657,2948,304,24481,29889],"total_duration":63317396361,"load_duration":221524,"prompt_eval_count":336,"prompt_eval_duration":30793400000,"eval_count":252,"eval_duration":32523224000}
