{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T13:04:02.358944605Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker begins by operating a diagnostic of the territory using a cartographer, which is a good starting point. However, they then shift their focus to studying the studies, attitudes, and resources of the county without fully explaining how these will help them understand how the community takes charge of its destiny. While the speaker does mention the existence of a community of the \"Nole-Local,\" composed of captains of industry, elected officials, citizens, and syndicats, they do not provide enough information about this community or how it functions.\n\nThe speaker's goal is to understand how this community works, who its members are, and how the policies that put it in place can engage the territory in a new scenario, but they do not provide enough context or evidence to support their claims. Additionally, the speaker does not address any potential counterarguments or challenges to their argument, which could have strengthened their position.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and comprehensive. A score of 3 out of 5 reflects this assessment.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,818,1874,261,316,23324,14119,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,1444,325,1759,270,29915,24430,1015,29539,443,652,21780,868,22922,23068,818,443,7774,1946,2488,472,342,1387,29889,11948,992,309,30001,29892,1597,10098,439,29915,265,263,1597,18551,13149,744,553,5189,743,634,553,6668,339,1179,868,22922,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,265,5246,1577,6803,25497,276,818,5278,1139,29892,1444,325,1759,2852,566,631,966,2852,4749,743,29892,966,2852,4749,743,29892,966,1098,17718,634,18475,2863,316,425,752,357,29892,427,1757,424,553,2637,2034,575,782,16573,553,704,3246,29889,7747,1750,2947,592,19172,276,270,29915,711,2974,3440,11797,544,2108,296,10713,15422,427,1667,29889,1459,346,712,2123,29875,29892,966,704,3246,544,2108,296,10713,15422,427,1667,29889,1720,21668,4048,6390,439,29915,309,19947,1597,28812,316,425,405,1772,29899,7717,29892,5541,1318,316,11934,13116,270,29915,20041,2546,29892,904,6092,29892,274,2049,29891,575,634,22898,293,1446,634,1841,348,583,26269,316,410,27499,3817,29879,553,2832,3783,14649,1912,29889,2598,541,29892,274,29915,342,316,7199,9030,3440,5278,28812,18165,484,29892,1750,427,3435,7015,18490,29892,439,1379,3435,10713,5302,2637,23778,29892,634,1354,966,2832,3783,14649,1912,1750,454,1539,29873,296,427,2058,29892,19172,296,270,29915,996,1875,454,22922,1465,443,13164,885,28951,29892,443,9577,367,585,885,28951,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,16410,491,13598,263,652,21780,310,278,20123,773,263,7774,1946,261,29892,607,338,263,1781,6257,1298,29889,2398,29892,896,769,9500,1009,8569,304,23382,278,11898,29892,1098,20816,29892,322,7788,310,278,15178,1728,8072,24232,920,1438,674,1371,963,2274,920,278,7881,4893,8323,310,967,2731,4901,29889,5806,278,25657,947,3585,278,10379,310,263,7881,310,278,376,29940,1772,29899,7717,1699,13725,310,4332,2708,310,13661,29892,11467,24921,29892,18363,29892,322,22898,293,1446,29892,896,437,451,3867,3307,2472,1048,445,7881,470,920,372,3168,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,7306,338,304,2274,920,445,7881,1736,29892,1058,967,5144,526,29892,322,920,278,24833,393,1925,372,297,2058,508,3033,482,278,20123,297,263,716,10483,29892,541,896,437,451,3867,3307,3030,470,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,947,451,3211,738,7037,6795,25699,470,18066,267,304,1009,2980,29892,607,1033,505,9324,6419,1009,2602,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,263,2821,322,1532,29899,4984,2955,2980,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,15171,6270,29889,319,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,9432,29879,445,24809,358,29889],"total_duration":61080271360,"load_duration":178139,"prompt_eval_count":279,"prompt_eval_duration":23993911000,"eval_count":299,"eval_duration":37085663000}
