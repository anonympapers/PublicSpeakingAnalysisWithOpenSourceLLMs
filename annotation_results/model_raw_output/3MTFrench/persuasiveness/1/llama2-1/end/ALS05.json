The speaker does provide some interesting insights into the properties of the fluid they are working with and how it can be made more eco-friendly by changing its composition. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. Lack of clear evidence: While the speaker provides some examples of how the fluid's composition can be modified to make it more eco-friendly, there is no clear evidence provided to support these claims. More research and data could be presented to back up the speaker's assertions.\n2. Vague language: At times, the speaker uses vague language that makes it difficult to understand their meaning. For example, the term \"biens de notre plan√®te\" is not clearly defined, making it hard to determine what the speaker is trying to convey.\n3. Lack of a clear call to action: While the speaker provides some interesting insights into the fluid's properties and potential eco-friendly modifications, there is no clear call to action for the audience to take action. More information on how the audience can get involved in making the fluid more eco-friendly could be provided.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the fluid's properties and potential eco-friendly modifications, there are areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and the message could be more clearly communicated to the audience.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,6803,18729,29892,1444,9577,610,1597,904,6737,12642,29872,950,29889,1551,1153,29926,2663,443,16160,275,7289,20674,1387,1750,2947,619,261,454,316,21646,5198,275,1821,29892,7847,802,7890,4078,29920,29892,4875,263,2123,29948,280,1597,452,346,262,285,14349,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,1153,29926,2663,316,301,29915,1191,488,1750,2947,17977,495,443,17756,868,12642,29872,950,634,12866,7697,276,1601,904,6737,2298,1998,29883,681,29889,1720,21668,286,29915,264,285,4680,316,878,30000,793,16573,634,782,13003,316,27962,4883,21824,2406,818,454,5226,283,29948,1671,7848,2852,4749,29948,7209,1970,441,882,29892,432,29915,4422,895,818,425,1702,13639,29892,1750,269,29915,932,1808,6267,263,1924,782,611,13639,29889,8748,1750,2947,623,492,7808,553,8249,316,1437,5404,270,29915,348,15243,29883,2131,1197,29948,1190,454,17887,4323,2131,868,20501,680,878,15340,427,1874,424,13545,1828,14228,29892,13545,3405,331,546,3698,634,966,2148,2361,2993,29889,12390,6896,19718,592,14735,296,425,27829,2131,316,544,2487,381,454,20299,882,316,2257,20501,680,269,29915,309,4182,553,1828,14228,3585,29876,2406,29892,1444,4771,18484,29889,3872,29883,992,309,30001,29892,1671,6896,4680,29892,454,289,5474,316,1775,29948,559,707,316,7199,9030,454,20299,882,634,4768,20015,868,20501,680,316,363,482,634,316,454,7697,276,2298,904,21553,1387,427,1874,424,872,15259,29889,8748,5646,29871,4277,29892,302,29915,342,712,1671,966,4768,575,316,24145,3814,12973,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,25657,29915,29879,20408,294,20193,297,25554,292,263,17953,3277,2643,29889,450,25657,947,3867,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,4426,310,278,22576,896,526,1985,411,322,920,372,508,367,1754,901,321,1111,29899,18326,368,491,6480,967,15259,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,2821,10757,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,6455,310,920,278,22576,29915,29879,15259,508,367,9120,304,1207,372,901,321,1111,29899,18326,368,29892,727,338,694,2821,10757,4944,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,5853,5925,322,848,1033,367,9132,304,1250,701,278,25657,29915,29879,4974,1080,29889,13,29906,29889,478,3437,4086,29901,2180,3064,29892,278,25657,3913,25160,4086,393,3732,372,5189,304,2274,1009,6593,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,1840,376,5365,575,316,24145,3814,12973,29908,338,451,9436,3342,29892,3907,372,2898,304,8161,825,278,25657,338,1811,304,27769,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,263,2821,1246,304,3158,29901,5806,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,22576,29915,29879,4426,322,7037,321,1111,29899,18326,368,26278,29892,727,338,694,2821,1246,304,3158,363,278,20026,304,2125,3158,29889,5853,2472,373,920,278,20026,508,679,9701,297,3907,278,22576,901,321,1111,29899,18326,368,1033,367,4944,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,8128,777,8031,1663,5861,964,278,22576,29915,29879,4426,322,7037,321,1111,29899,18326,368,26278,29892,727,526,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,278,2643,1033,367,901,9436,7212,630,304,278,20026,29889],"total_duration":70065895905,"load_duration":172916,"prompt_eval_count":296,"prompt_eval_duration":27138937000,"eval_count":331,"eval_duration":42926217000}
