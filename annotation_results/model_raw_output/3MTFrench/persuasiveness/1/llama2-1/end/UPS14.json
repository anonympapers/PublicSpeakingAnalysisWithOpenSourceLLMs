The speaker presents their idea in a clear and concise manner, but there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker does a good job of introducing the problem they are trying to solve, which is the difficulty of predicting the resistance of complex materials. They provide a specific example of how this issue arises in their own research, which helps to establish the relevance and importance of the topic.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker's reasoning could be more rigorous. For example, they state that \"au quotidien, est-ce que ça tient mieux sur notre mail beaucoup en tort d'un petit peu ou sur notre mail un petit peu en tort d'un beaucoup?\" without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support their claim. Additionally, the speaker's statement that \"les motons, vous êtes certainement arrivé ici\" could be seen as a non sequitur and does not logically follow from the previous sentence.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents their idea in a clear and engaging manner, there are some areas where their reasoning could be more rigorous and evidence-based to make their argument more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2257,1750,2947,286,29915,524,1064,16136,29892,274,29915,342,316,19397,634,878,3610,7608,634,544,2487,381,425,6896,21558,316,425,24304,6184,712,432,29915,1794,9484,29948,29889,1174,18165,316,10741,1828,14228,29892,4191,925,882,301,29915,2521,316,260,943,1080,29892,3503,5695,425,5418,270,29915,14056,655,488,358,29889,7747,1750,5246,439,29915,585,13911,333,819,707,6079,1444,592,18593,553,5155,4191,707,29899,346,712,29871,4277,260,993,6628,1314,1190,24145,10524,21394,427,16263,270,29915,348,17887,7006,2123,1190,24145,10524,443,17887,7006,427,16263,270,29915,348,21394,29973,315,29915,342,10814,29892,432,29915,1794,1841,375,1039,818,16454,966,325,1239,2993,29892,5291,831,6079,10019,1693,29889,8748,6701,1354,7015,5155,269,13365,296,9577,805,4582,361,3783,29892,20554,325,609,8556,19172,276,316,6787,533,553,878,30000,793,13219,272,3783,21394,2298,16805,1314,1750,1437,699,794,1597,2919,24988,1004,316,1775,4894,2993,712,301,29915,265,623,1808,553,1775,4894,2993,4280,267,29889,8748,1671,427,337,15470,818,7814,3184,787,29892,7890,29871,22730,3058,882,6974,29948,29871,1654,29892,427,7890,766,424,966,3184,787,29892,373,24722,9577,6079,2257,712,274,29915,342,29892,274,29915,342,553,3778,2993,17520,3783,29892,25235,14746,29892,3667,267,5695,29892,3503,980,343,263,2298,4595,12784,818,4048,6390,1190,23778,29889,8748,6079,432,29915,9983,1908,439,29915,264,2656,424,29892,7890,1095,9386,15749,24145,18551,29892,610,346,712,4191,766,1249,454,17887,15927,29892,17043,13639,29892,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3022,895,8214,29892,541,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,13,13,1576,25657,947,263,1781,4982,310,4547,3277,278,1108,896,526,1811,304,4505,29892,607,338,278,14656,310,8500,292,278,17711,310,4280,17279,29889,2688,3867,263,2702,1342,310,920,445,2228,564,4637,297,1009,1914,5925,29892,607,6911,304,10127,278,29527,749,322,13500,310,278,11261,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,25657,29915,29879,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,29889,1152,1342,29892,896,2106,393,376,585,13911,333,819,29892,707,29899,346,712,29871,4277,260,993,6628,1314,1190,24145,10524,21394,427,16263,270,29915,348,17887,7006,2123,1190,24145,10524,443,17887,7006,427,16263,270,29915,348,21394,3026,1728,13138,738,10757,470,16667,24481,304,2304,1009,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,3229,393,376,793,3184,787,29892,7890,29871,22730,3058,882,6974,29948,29871,1654,29908,1033,367,3595,408,263,1661,8617,277,332,322,947,451,1480,1711,1101,515,278,3517,10541,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,1009,2969,297,263,2821,322,3033,6751,8214,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,1009,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,10757,29899,6707,304,1207,1009,2980,901,20408,294,573,29889],"total_duration":63314122246,"load_duration":222913,"prompt_eval_count":305,"prompt_eval_duration":27580140000,"eval_count":285,"eval_duration":35733220000}
