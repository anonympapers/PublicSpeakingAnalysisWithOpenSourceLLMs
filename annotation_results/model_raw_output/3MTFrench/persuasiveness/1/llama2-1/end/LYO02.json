The speaker presents some interesting insights into how our brains process information and how it can be used to better manage complexity in our lives. However, the reasoning presented is not always rigorous, and some of the arguments could be further developed.\n\nThe speaker makes some valid points about the limitations of our understanding of how our brains work and the potential benefits of exploring this topic further. They also provide some interesting examples of how understanding how our brains process information can be used to improve our lives. However, the speech could benefit from more detailed explanations and evidence to support these claims.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that \"on peut tr√®s bien vivre et entreprendre plein de choses sans vraiment comprendre comment on fonctionne.\" While this is true, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of how people are able to function and accomplish tasks without a full understanding of how their brains work. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more evidence to support their claims about the potential benefits of exploring how our brains process information.\n\nOverall, while the speech presents some interesting ideas, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence to fully convince the audience of its persuasiveness.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,634,6267,639,1441,868,8714,29889,28079,29871,4277,1671,7199,9030,3440,6628,1314,19493,261,8691,553,8774,3068,1608,267,316,24145,5147,345,585,712,2257,12852,1671,6628,1314,330,29539,425,4280,2131,8182,790,1647,316,7814,325,583,1671,4224,283,20069,1597,2637,29883,5606,29882,1926,2131,2123,1671,6628,1314,7199,9030,23563,25698,19503,6042,2993,29889,1551,8164,9577,6079,9364,276,634,23440,9030,5644,262,316,521,15806,7209,325,336,2073,7199,9030,3440,373,18165,484,29889,7747,302,29915,342,2331,23309,29889,8748,2637,8556,29892,274,29915,342,4191,443,5516,361,29892,18097,373,343,1841,1579,17192,277,29889,897,24145,21384,29892,1354,373,7905,3008,28230,316,7199,9030,29892,3440,373,18165,484,818,425,8861,10098,29889,6803,844,22687,818,9364,276,29892,373,26030,18413,844,3977,29948,634,373,452,16933,2331,18916,29889,1459,346,712,274,29915,342,18097,6701,443,1095,15164,316,409,3209,29883,1318,425,17949,1671,7199,9030,2257,1750,409,21714,1465,443,3147,29873,2353,29889,29871,30219,29874,2947,2970,1354,373,18331,818,9073,29892,5646,2257,439,29915,265,18331,818,9073,29889,27677,7199,9030,3440,373,5246,29889,11948,14034,29920,2257,439,29915,265,1671,8356,9073,29889,6101,373,26939,6628,1314,29892,5646,2257,1750,409,21714,18916,29899,29882,1300,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,22981,777,8031,1663,5861,964,920,1749,4105,1144,1889,2472,322,920,372,508,367,1304,304,2253,10933,13644,297,1749,12080,29889,2398,29892,278,24481,9132,338,451,2337,12912,20657,29892,322,777,310,278,6273,1033,367,4340,8906,29889,13,13,1576,25657,3732,777,2854,3291,1048,278,27028,310,1749,8004,310,920,1749,4105,1144,664,322,278,7037,23633,310,3902,8253,445,11261,4340,29889,2688,884,3867,777,8031,6455,310,920,8004,920,1749,4105,1144,1889,2472,508,367,1304,304,11157,1749,12080,29889,2398,29892,278,12032,1033,14169,515,901,13173,7309,800,322,10757,304,2304,1438,16726,29889,13,13,2831,1342,29892,278,25657,26649,393,376,265,8164,9577,6079,9364,276,634,23440,9030,5644,262,316,521,15806,7209,325,336,2073,7199,9030,3440,373,18165,484,1213,5806,445,338,1565,29892,372,723,367,8444,304,3867,901,2702,6455,310,920,2305,526,2221,304,740,322,12709,9595,1728,263,2989,8004,310,920,1009,4105,1144,664,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,1033,505,4944,901,10757,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,7037,23633,310,3902,8253,920,1749,4105,1144,1889,2472,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,22981,777,8031,7014,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,10757,304,8072,7602,1239,278,20026,310,967,20408,294,20193,29889],"total_duration":59475287237,"load_duration":159664,"prompt_eval_count":255,"prompt_eval_duration":23480628000,"eval_count":284,"eval_duration":35994004000}
