The speaker provides some interesting insights into the relationship between modernity and coloniality, but there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened.\n\nFirstly, the speaker could have provided more concrete examples and evidence to support their claims. While they mention specific works of 19th century literature that describe indigenous peoples, they could have delved deeper into the ways in which these texts represent and reinforce colonial attitudes and practices. By providing more specific examples, the speaker could have made their argument more compelling and convincing.\n\nSecondly, the speaker could have clarified the exact mechanisms by which modernity perpetuates coloniality. While they mention that modernity is \"like the other side of the coin,\" they do not fully elaborate on how this works. By providing more detail on the ways in which modernity and coloniality are intertwined, the speaker could have made their argument more coherent and persuasive.\n\nOverall, while the speaker provides some interesting insights into the relationship between modernity and coloniality, there are areas where the argument could be strengthened through the provision of more concrete examples and evidence.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,350,999,29892,432,29915,4548,9854,818,9811,1379,29889,435,29915,28899,275,818,315,1151,585,2261,276,29892,443,592,29883,872,410,1173,29892,373,2313,1082,29892,11797,592,9667,296,2257,712,1444,16623,1465,425,6316,29889,8748,1354,373,5291,16623,439,7768,1465,425,6316,1577,435,29915,6698,1759,2331,11878,1597,22577,260,5340,29889,1720,592,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29889,1720,966,372,361,980,707,1436,29875,610,592,1261,3825,29889,8748,4875,707,1190,439,7768,1577,323,29915,29874,260,5340,29889,2581,25497,29889,6298,966,1095,335,22702,316,425,282,1160,294,634,316,425,282,10870,946,9599,29889,1174,19896,457,29889,1720,5246,13625,1358,316,734,26842,16136,29892,11797,592,1261,5863,993,16784,2459,634,454,1644,1064,2093,29889,3674,29892,1444,26099,1465,611,772,1173,29892,29871,4277,26030,1597,2930,10491,29889,2581,592,28905,29889,1174,5246,29892,966,2313,2470,1190,454,410,629,2093,29892,454,24305,29892,966,953,273,7334,800,3435,4191,454,21384,8230,316,425,2930,10491,29889,7747,439,29915,265,2947,623,7367,18916,5400,2131,29889,315,29915,342,2257,712,301,29915,265,8556,7629,276,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,265,24722,10042,5646,29889,11948,301,29915,735,2488,363,29883,15471,454,1224,424,316,5278,2930,10491,29892,712,5291,2906,1475,29892,3503,1750,302,29915,342,2331,7962,1465,301,29915,6727,2487,7163,29889,10793,3700,274,496,1318,12450,2016,301,29915,459,23881,29892,301,29915,262,571,1611,4371,29892,425,2432,3381,316,23563,7006,29889,7747,439,29915,265,2947,623,7367,18916,25539,2131,29889,897,26722,13149,744,29892,5278,2930,10491,5829,15826,454,9122,634,872,1480,1387,316,18165,17239,29889,1720,452,8164,343,11469,316,5400,2131,7209,25539,2131,29889,319,8019,316,2257,5246,29892,19601,29892,432,29915,24209,344,966,8774,3068,1608,267,316,5278,1480,1387,270,29915,29877,30071,29880,1465,454,541,316,7199,9030,3440,425,5400,2131,29892,818,21933,546,818,301,29915,29948,2576,3381,4824,1387,316,3058,267,9434,375,634,301,29915,29948,2576,3381,5829,1387,270,29915,29874,895,14857,427,19896,457,782,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,29889,1720,286,29915,4582,2663,29892,980,286,29915,4582,2663,2331,29892,274,29915,342,454,286,4582,2663,29889,2581,6773,29889,1174,13495,29892,2257,1750,286,29915,524,29948,23458,1465,425,18768,8691,316,611,17949,29892,2257,3435,966,10419,800,1426,29884,4999,29889,435,29915,711,16349,4191,966,288,29872,4090,690,868,29871,29896,29929,29872,8115,1750,1437,699,794,966,1399,335,22702,29892,373,3534,4664,7015,4239,2258,29284,29889,1174,5246,29892,1444,454,872,275,712,270,29915,25378,1597,26722,270,29915,29948,699,29878,427,24635,8104,4379,29892,553,286,1862,29892,553,266,19503,29892,553,13994,316,3114,29892,553,18845,29892,553,298,5137,2658,818,18741,29948,29892,553,4047,2063,29892,1750,6664,23510,10741,10098,1465,1601,14913,2298,634,1750,3435,1559,23096,316,5278,1480,1387,712,432,29915,1794,1437,4951,275,427,2504,759,8691,29889,1720,5246,427,330,4196,29892,432,29915,2749,9061,7787,29892,980,16067,443,564,3274,533,2174,861,29892,980,592,26427,1671,339,7768,432,29915,1794,3060,10770,316,29231,5495,1190,2257,29140,29889,435,29915,1794,25497,29889,435,29915,1794,325,5059,29884,1539,2484,427,19703,5289,29892,818,425,5400,2131,29892,425,25539,2131,316,24145,9122,29892,1465,454,541,316,1841,1579,17192,381,1190,966,1136,21871,2063,2832,3783,634,2893,277,7147,29892,427,330,355,8356,610,966,2313,2470,270,29915,326,1545,824,267,9291,29915,30001,7814,16283,29889,951,13659,316,301,29915,348,329,2779,29884,424,29871,29906,29900,29896,29906,29892,12468,1808,712,8556,302,29915,264,1029,787,2331,1436,29875,2535,425,21448,13107,2249,15819,29892,425,1841,558,29948,27381,634,425,2313,5632,3381,270,29915,309,343,301,29915,29891,432,29915,1794,8474,966,1236,552,14033,10270,29889,951,541,316,611,266,17449,707,1436,6311,316,14954,4630,13545,25179,787,267,1465,454,1209,29948,1671,6628,1314,7199,9030,425,6434,1044,13498,316,1354,3817,2131,29892,1750,15481,371,15237,4239,6476,7799,7907,1671,9073,3390,261,6267,17950,29892,3700,782,17284,634,782,1773,262,1288,29889,1720,592,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29892,1444,454,1072,19755,29892,
