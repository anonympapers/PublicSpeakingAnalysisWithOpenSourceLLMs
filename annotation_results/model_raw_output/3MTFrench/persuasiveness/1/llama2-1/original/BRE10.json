{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T10:34:17.634889543Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does an effective job of crafting a convincing message and presenting a rigorous argument. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Use of relatable examples: The speaker uses everyday examples of people behaving like they're at the beach in urban spaces to make their point. This helps to create a sense of familiarity and relevance for the audience, making them more likely to engage with the message.\n2. Emphasis on the importance of the research: The speaker clearly communicates the significance of their research and why it matters. By highlighting the lack of understanding about how people behave in urban spaces, they create a sense of intrigue and curiosity among the audience.\n3. Use of rhetorical devices: The speaker employs various rhetorical devices, such as metaphors (e.g., \"un tout-du-duin\") and repetition (e.g., \"ces plages improvis√©es\"), to add depth and emotional resonance to their message.\n4. Engagement with the audience: The speaker actively engages with the audience by addressing them directly and asking for their thoughts and experiences. This helps to create a sense of connection and participation, which can be persuasive in itself.\n5. Clear presentation of the thesis: The speaker presents their thesis clearly and concisely, highlighting the main points and arguments. This makes it easy for the audience to follow and understand the main ideas.\n\nHowever, there is one area where the speech could be improved:\n\n1. Lack of evidence beyond anecdotes: While the speaker provides several relatable examples, they rely primarily on anecdotal evidence to support their claims. To make their argument more persuasive, they could benefit from presenting more systematic and empirical data to back up their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,2023,478,681,17043,5582,29920,1190,1601,3681,5644,262,29889,478,681,343,29871,22730,8164,29899,5474,20737,599,29948,2123,868,11387,7890,427,17043,5582,29920,454,29095,29889,6803,19449,1750,452,17043,19047,2331,29892,274,29915,342,2560,29889,1551,707,2601,296,868,13714,29892,1437,7830,29885,993,29892,553,1301,1078,29892,427,5644,457,8441,29889,8748,8171,29892,5646,454,9122,409,1437,29920,370,347,1671,9073,12246,29920,7848,4191,818,425,715,482,29889,8748,6079,29892,1601,29140,316,323,9297,4546,262,29892,21668,443,5646,29899,700,29899,700,262,263,5246,21624,270,29915,264,3221,2298,11468,27153,1750,16067,2058,1465,7814,4213,267,29889,9353,23563,5152,3302,970,267,18484,782,12796,316,301,29915,14531,29892,966,7537,328,1144,4625,10331,749,818,409,752,9555,4191,818,425,715,482,29892,8532,712,454,13003,302,29915,342,818,3691,4170,2331,818,1757,1875,1671,29889,7747,3435,7015,5152,3302,29899,27048,712,8556,1029,787,16794,29948,966,715,1179,23499,13116,805,609,273,2406,29889,365,29915,3318,361,316,611,266,17449,29892,274,29915,342,316,7199,9030,2257,1750,1465,425,18652,2131,316,7015,3804,1314,29892,9949,6267,7128,362,610,966,7537,328,1144,634,966,282,21167,818,946,381,316,425,29835,29889,11948,10042,5646,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,439,29915,348,20299,882,316,715,482,592,2970,29920,29899,23088,29973,8748,6079,1465,443,378,29149,6722,425,6316,707,316,2298,427,2298,9577,269,2016,29892,634,6722,3058,267,18554,302,29915,609,2331,301,29915,15693,7002,270,29915,12572,427,11757,2925,29892,23563,3804,1314,409,7845,296,1597,13618,316,17176,29948,29892,634,14924,5695,11172,270,29915,348,316,439,7768,2299,1524,29892,316,1104,30057,4630,6267,14913,634,6267,269,29915,267,558,347,3700,818,301,29915,14531,29892,782,14419,309,634,782,9712,29892,634,29202,6701,316,1437,4738,966,27299,21158,634,966,611,30085,2993,316,289,475,29892,5646,4191,818,425,715,482,29889,12390,1098,20816,3677,12841,9230,3479,1098,20816,23499,13116,2299,1981,4999,29892,28185,9373,1559,16027,275,2406,610,425,12912,333,2131,29892,454,4313,12161,634,425,337,841,434,29892,544,2108,296,2058,443,385,29892,610,17488,29892,1465,10741,715,1179,23499,13116,805,609,273,2406,782,12796,316,301,29915,1466,634,316,301,29915,284,6390,29889,12390,715,1179,4857,1730,2406,3534,19544,316,270,29915,1540,760,29892,443,13659,12694,296,818,301,29915,267,3535,970,29892,6722,454,7537,328,424,15210,1044,5411,29892,634,1661,20498,882,6683,7289,553,502,1179,316,872,8441,29892,3503,5695,29892,26154,29892,443,13659,297,2487,601,782,14913,29892,12866,1444,452,29835,316,1136,8841,2411,506,568,269,13365,296,966,432,986,326,1759,454,1437,1365,488,358,29889,478,681,8992,29920,3058,882,20737,9332,29948,1597,8691,316,7015,20299,4110,1465,325,359,4213,267,29889,18410,2708,316,7890,3435,8164,29899,5474,16454,818,301,29915,1062,29878,5093,29892,3503,2257,3435,2601,2406,782,12796,316,301,29915,14531,29892,2535,27299,21158,29892,2181,5000,899,5218,634,611,30085,2993,316,289,475,29892,634,23563,427,286,473,336,993,8164,29899,5474,270,29915,264,1730,7209,288,643,16454,9291,29915,585,25927,29889,8748,6079,29892,425,5582,29920,29899,4346,29875,7890,2970,712,7015,1098,20816,452,325,23510,2331,20498,882,316,7890,29889,8748,1661,29892,7890,302,29915,22730,2331,2025,6311,13220,29889,365,29915,267,3535,5246,29202,316,7890,2257,439,29915,309,2453,329,29889,1174,7890,5820,424,29892,7890,286,29915,1351,29920,623,3780,1373,28805,270,29915,348,29892,10741,521,15806,1190,7015,1095,307,1169,13180,1601,22085,9061,29889,478,681,286,29915,1351,29920,623,3780,29892,610,17488,29892,712,553,7877,29948,1860,316,5796,415,545,2535,301,29915,21813,17239,23499,475,29892,260,1808,712,425,285,5903,2487,362,29892,425,29845,270,29915,1540,282,2016,29892,2123,425,12694,663,316,19666,29892,7890,263,1241,29874,7890,1104,30057,4630,818,443,8441,29889,435,29915,1794,7199,275,712,301,29915,14531,7890,27516,1597,4771,362,553,658,647,4110,29892,5695,6079,5829,3783,712,1998,2491,29892,1750,7890,263,1241,29874,7890,4303,29539,29889,11948,432,29915,1794,5695,4370,5227,407,29948,610,966,14231,285,2905,1169,610,23563,270,29915,14056,7890,29892,1671,7175,862,261,6267,14913,270,29915,7342,427,12246,29920,424,100
