{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-21T20:53:43.870407526Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as metaphors (e.g., \"la vie est comme le taro\") and repetition (e.g., \"mon travail, c'est d'étudier l'asquise au freinit\") to make their message more convincing. However, the speaker's reasoning is not always rigorous, as they sometimes rely on simplistic or unproven claims (e.g., \"les alliances entre joueurs et la capacité de chacun, a joué la bonne carte au bon moment peuvent tout changer\").\n\nIn terms of the dimension described in the scale, the speaker's use of emotional appeals and personal anecdotes is effective in conveying their message and engaging the audience. However, the speaker's arguments could benefit from more logical and evidence-based reasoning to be more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,8407,5321,15532,29892,20737,1444,12278,1759,553,521,15806,289,15356,690,29892,553,26943,1750,325,5059,2406,29892,589,9318,19601,29892,634,19601,1750,28078,11818,29892,782,6282,5695,4191,818,1939,275,327,29889,11948,610,385,782,3256,633,536,3409,29948,18097,432,29915,879,275,29871,29941,6063,29892,1444,302,29915,1794,18413,6664,29884,611,21428,29889,2581,452,1236,1314,2331,282,2747,454,6788,29889,315,29915,342,611,260,2016,439,29915,309,5246,29889,4546,29875,29892,1444,452,26099,2011,29948,2331,316,6023,261,7594,339,29915,348,29889,315,29915,342,427,1601,509,424,443,904,15519,29892,1224,29871,29896,29947,6063,29892,712,432,29915,1794,5246,611,8861,12033,1230,316,23921,2247,29889,435,29915,879,275,766,29948,9577,694,381,29892,1444,2665,1759,9411,966,18025,29892,966,3581,280,1295,29892,6674,492,29948,25763,966,274,2028,1295,25179,492,1912,29889,2581,302,29915,1794,18413,2062,275,316,9201,6079,29889,997,12784,1750,592,1702,13871,2779,19882,23428,927,634,4555,1444,452,592,3669,1403,575,2331,29892,274,29915,342,2637,454,3256,6722,1444,286,29915,12184,1173,14255,19601,1465,611,11179,1030,29892,634,454,3256,6722,1444,592,1841,345,1924,1465,425,269,3498,270,29915,10718,944,29889,438,1481,1444,325,1759,5153,9030,29892,3503,443,8694,1444,302,29915,264,724,1759,2331,712,5153,9030,29892,1444,1083,609,17016,29889,2581,26099,2257,1750,409,3005,457,29889,997,6316,29892,274,29915,342,4191,454,260,8854,29889,1720,343,263,966,521,2925,1750,4625,1597,1667,5644,457,270,29915,271,17718,29892,21975,425,4978,553,7774,267,29889,422,1004,26814,626,4790,8146,263,11878,316,610,17488,29892,1750,707,5273,2535,1597,2723,381,427,564,479,427,425,26003,29889,8748,818,301,29915,262,3901,29892,980,343,263,966,4439,8825,1314,29892,1750,1671,454,17103,4625,1597,1667,5644,457,316,7774,267,427,20368,332,29892,9577,4439,8691,29889,11948,454,260,8854,29892,2257,302,29915,342,2331,427,18308,899,9407,29892,427,20744,29892,966,394,13036,2637,8121,11620,634,425,11101,2131,316,521,562,348,29892,263,8121,29948,425,289,7293,20206,782,10814,3256,20423,5646,1874,261,29889,3872,29883,29892,6701,7209,818,5646,1465,872,1667,29892,3503,2535,4581,29899,29965,29891,2663,4191,394,492,29948,29892,373,8164,330,18303,29889,8748,297,874,882,29892,6701,1354,373,263,9411,966,1098,17718,634,5644,262,316,289,24729,7774,267,29892,3503,712,7814,784,793,1750,2930,13546,452,4048,296,2331,8121,261,29892,2123,8532,712,12852,6701,427,1970,898,454,282,1387,634,454,1020,29888,29892,425,6316,452,12852,3503,2331,1223,332,1318,29889,997,6316,29892,274,29915,342,4191,454,260,8854,29889,8748,966,2071,275,782,3005,262,29892,2257,3435,19449,1750,4625,316,286,585,1564,4637,7774,267,29892,1750,4625,316,286,585,1564,275,17103,904,1017,1631,414,29892,634,1750,452,4048,296,2331,8121,261,29889,315,29915,342,5278,10345,305,30000,944,316,286,585,1564,275,5902,3075,2925,1750,1757,296,818,425,4439,328,347,29889,2598,18848,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,1893,566,631,301,29915,294,339,895,782,3005,2344,29889,6803,29871,4277,29892,1444,301,29915,314,457,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,14559,3778,2993,712,966,3165,2708,29892,29871,1654,29892,553,269,473,275,29889,29871,30219,29874,269,29915,932,1808,29892,592,27188,7608,29892,301,29915,294,339,895,782,3005,2344,29892,14255,301,29915,294,473,275,29889,3872,29883,29892,1444,16623,8121,261,553,269,473,275,782,260,8854,29892,3503,1444,301,29915,24568,443,316,286,585,1564,275,17103,904,6578,339,743,29889,2581,301,29915,24568,443,316,286,585,1564,4637,7774,267,29892,634,1444,452,454,12468,28759,2331,818,8121,261,29889,1174,13495,29892,1444,1072,19755,24850,639,6289,29889,6101,274,29915,342,454,3209,29892,274,29915,342,712,432,29915,1794,6079,5246,1601,18848,29889,1281,4838,882,29892,373,2947,9073,1014,381,553,1006,794,1080,818,553,19462,7175,3476,316,425,6316,553,269,473,275,1750,325,609,11469,443,10879,1671,12563,6267,6316,29889,997,8861,1006,7316,409,5246,10042,6267,1055,9948,29889,1174,5246,29892,373,878,28821,443,330,8146,1750,14255,301,29915,16063,475,29892,634,619,29948,2535,425,4439,328,347,29889,1174,13495,29892,373,18332,868,508,7183,275,782,269,473,275,1671,427,2298,6267,594,6544,29883,663,29889,11948,10042,29
