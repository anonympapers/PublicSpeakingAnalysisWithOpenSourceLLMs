{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-03-22T12:13:36.67746462Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasoning, but there are also some areas where the argumentation could be strengthened.\n\nOne strength of the speech is the use of specific examples and data to support the speaker's claims. For instance, the speaker provides statistics on the impact of social economy on GDP and job creation, which helps to make their argument more convincing. Additionally, the speaker acknowledges potential limitations of social economy and addresses them by proposing solutions, such as increasing funding for social economy initiatives.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the speaker could improve their argumentation. For example, the speaker's claim that social economy is \"very important\" without providing evidence to support this claim could be strengthened by presenting specific studies or research that demonstrate the significance of social economy. Similarly, the speaker's assertion that social economy can help \"reconcile economic disparities\" could be further developed by providing more details on how this might be achieved.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some convincing arguments and reasoning, there are areas where they could improve their argumentation to make their case even stronger.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,315,29915,342,966,12278,1179,323,2123,365,895,12022,553,260,23435,1750,3435,1661,1804,6832,743,427,316,4239,301,30000,2710,2664,14979,23435,1750,269,29915,342,9577,19398,3911,634,1750,454,285,1572,503,568,966,373,1372,7907,966,10890,8748,16134,424,966,23837,583,5264,267,2664,1700,2187,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,315,29915,342,9577,953,833,2570,273,2664,4292,9230,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,296,966,1700,29884,1691,9577,1153,23883,29899,3712,8748,1766,22692,29920,29899,344,9100,29892,2011,267,29892,25533,3076,29892,425,20118,10681,1314,29899,4924,1190,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,1465,301,29915,15654,317,23071,29899,29873,29899,381,8748,301,29915,11569,7081,6017,424,3479,4356,375,1720,302,29915,29891,263,2331,10814,1671,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,365,895,29920,553,7175,29899,24911,267,302,29915,342,2331,21394,270,29915,287,3409,29948,1671,553,9484,7147,427,443,12471,17239,12128,7853,519,317,23071,29899,29873,29899,381,751,29875,302,29915,342,2331,1950,1671,534,8885,301,29915,562,5450,3224,1085,29948,29899,344,9100,7102,10120,425,11896,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,1174,707,29899,309,6309,966,13181,550,553,10273,743,558,1169,512,509,6223,29920,966,10273,293,532,2658,1174,16132,5278,10273,293,532,2658,707,1863,296,2581,534,8885,1794,425,11896,2637,966,23837,347,5264,634,966,10273,743,558,1169,1174,16134,424,1671,339,7768,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,1720,343,263,818,19601,8748,260,29915,267,1804,29948,427,1035,307,568,2637,301,29915,22537,347,634,301,29915,29948,561,1662,317,23071,29899,29873,29899,381,997,18187,362,316,9411,5898,29899,3034,262,751,29875,1283,276,317,2016,317,2016,3067,29886,417,29875,1190,553,8595,317,23071,29899,29873,29899,381,6912,11710,751,29915,342,29899,346,1750,409,21714,29973,1954,22094,29920,1597,23837,347,1750,27435,4785,666,307,1066,424,553,7930,371,29899,558,1169,5264,5462,274,29915,342,425,1020,568,316,1841,29881,475,1704,661,371,29899,29886,473,1760,853,1841,700,428,316,402,2736,9353,454,27666,2186,317,23071,29899,29873,29899,381,853,23837,347,9577,4100,3067,2388,300,3321,838,943,274,29915,342,365,29915,14531,897,10420,267,751,29875,269,29915,309,343,263,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,707,9577,4100,8748,4625,28643,443,7048,27774,532,2658,315,29915,342,443,302,1709,17631,1947,818,301,29915,3496,381,8748,427,27516,1174,18551,5027,535,5553,631,2726,1437,1150,267,23837,3783,8748,427,8748,315,29915,342,2331,315,29915,342,6624,29948,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,2980,362,1033,367,9324,6419,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,278,671,310,2702,6455,322,848,304,2304,278,25657,29915,29879,16726,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,25657,8128,13964,373,278,10879,310,5264,26504,373,402,11191,322,4982,11265,29892,607,6911,304,1207,1009,2980,901,17953,3277,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,24084,2710,7037,27028,310,5264,26504,322,14157,963,491,9551,292,6851,29892,1316,408,10231,5220,292,363,5264,26504,14511,5056,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,25657,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,5995,393,5264,26504,338,376,1201,4100,29908,1728,13138,10757,304,2304,445,5995,1033,367,9324,6419,491,2198,292,2702,11898,470,5925,393,22222,278,26002,310,5264,26504,29889,20175,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,28306,393,5264,26504,508,1371,376,276,535,21873,17407,17508,1907,29908,1033,367,4340,8906,491,13138,901,4902,373,920,445,1795,367,14363,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,25657,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,322,24481,29892,727,526,10161,988,896,1033,11157,1009,2980,362,304,1207,1009,1206,1584,23505,29889],"total_duration":81025446135,"load_duration":284205,"prompt_eval_count":502,"prompt_eval_duration":46456440000,"eval_count":268,"eval_duration":34568219000}
