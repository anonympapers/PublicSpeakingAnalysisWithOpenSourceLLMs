The speaker provides some interesting and innovative ideas for using nature as inspiration for new technologies, such as using cellulose from trees to create flexible and transparent solar panels. However, the speaker also uses some vague language and makes some unsubstantiated claims, which detracts from the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nFor example, the speaker mentions that \"les BVTR et de notre salon pourrait alors produire de l'électricité durante la journée,\" but does not provide any specific details or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker assumes that the audience will find the ideas presented convincing without providing any logical reasoning or evidence to back up their claims.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents some intriguing ideas, they could benefit from providing more concrete details and evidence to support their claims in order to be more persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2023,6101,8556,544,264,2993,425,5469,1671,10754,29892,8556,8556,7779,2749,787,18413,29889,315,29915,342,1601,452,15529,29892,2331,316,19601,29892,3503,316,4832,724,787,29889,1720,270,29915,328,11836,29871,29906,29900,29900,29900,6063,634,1671,443,20674,2488,29892,11797,4625,270,29915,1300,424,2298,316,29871,29896,29900,29900,5898,29899,29926,536,375,29889,478,681,7890,26427,29920,3058,882,1671,339,7768,1577,382,29882,6079,29892,1444,7890,16193,1597,3966,481,1943,427,363,11992,29889,2169,19755,29920,4191,4875,260,993,12563,872,8261,5340,29892,373,263,12033,2131,634,872,2653,9948,868,14419,309,29889,10793,904,1089,12053,867,8088,568,707,633,898,1647,29889,4241,841,424,29892,980,6382,262,787,24145,13911,333,819,316,1261,475,29892,6722,980,302,29915,29874,8441,409,1841,29873,23459,261,316,425,5469,29892,378,30019,434,2535,553,3503,787,1120,359,3096,275,424,427,904,1089,12053,29889,2664,350,29963,5659,634,316,24145,4497,265,1671,8356,8532,1391,533,316,301,29915,29948,781,2200,2131,13933,425,21824,1318,29892,712,8556,1136,3011,787,454,29627,427,8556,904,16398,381,424,29889,29871,30219,29874,5246,364,30037,369,1465,29889,4785,29875,6701,10420,261,443,885,28951,316,1436,316,10466,24159,29889,3067,20812,787,29899,280,21285,29892,3503,1671,18729,980,8556,21668,8121,261,1190,316,454,1403,414,29892,425,5802,634,425,1136,3011,362,270,29915,29948,1089,12053,29889,3185,27751,29892,8556,4048,787,1391,533,316,301,29915,29948,781,2200,2131,23068,3479,7243,484,2993,899,7147,29889,360,29915,8284,1295,29892,373,707,6701,15390,270,29915,264,1391,533,553,2316,29875,743,316,1539,2484,454,1559,5606,818,8019,868,269,519,29889,1174,337,3703,1173,29892,454,7697,2331,12471,17239,284,18062,5646,818,5246,2313,9246,1190,5646,7628,339,29915,265,633,24568,966,5155,316,5802,634,316,1162,29891,695,482,29889,8748,1444,452,7890,610,280,6701,2331,316,301,29915,2817,2592,868,9744,482,29889,751,392,443,14857,1136,3011,362,8556,3667,895,787,29871,29906,29900,29995,316,301,29915,29948,781,2200,2131,1391,568,1671,966,1067,29948,22428,29889,8396,29892,1444,7890,364,465,545,18729,2947,22964,2853,1597,15217,5722,5458,11176,479,14344,553,301,30000,2783,2894,3783,29889,360,29915,4812,327,316,19703,8226,802,4625,480,818,8019,316,5697,3246,6062,29948,21337,712,301,29915,265,5663,6223,1465,7015,26957,427,7446,280,2362,344,1136,3011,362,29889,8748,1465,7015,26957,13745,4924,29892,7890,4078,29920,29892,14344,316,10914,29883,5059,545,634,3479,24618,661,297,2764,12491,29889,27816,29892,1671,966,10135,374,7808,966,1775,4894,2993,22700,743,3435,10440,4280,267,29892,1302,30095,371,1314,634,301,29915,370,487,1314,818,8019,316,6062,29948,21337,1721,375,868,282,1893,12154,29889,8748,2123,29875,29892,2535,443,13547,13181,273,29892,1444,7890,4771,443,7006,15416,7366,361,29889,9550,14125,21285,2257,885,28951,29889,2581,1671,23469,7890,9551,261,270,29915,9979,13241,1597,3038,1297,899,5218,2535,1597,301,14785,2894,1387,29889,7747,3911,29899,455,4642,1249,443,2560,2706,29892,3669,552,634,26154,17772,316,966,282,30000,29883,5908,270,29915,1540,20491,1924,316,3500,631,29889,5462,301,29915,265,1671,8356,623,492,7808,1190,7814,289,5903,30058,509,2406,634,6079,269,30095,29878,29892,2257,3911,29899,455,25810,27666,316,26722,904,2616,26679,519,29889,319,4951,316,269,29915,3470,4014,381,553,1391,1169,29892,282,1893,307,4926,1671,10628,7869,7814,11549,277,10270,29892,1444,19760,23532,1601,8681,12232,263,26231,29889,8748,4191,8556,301,29915,485,787,18679,5646,818,301,29915,28661,29892,301,29915,279,2200,354,1509,316,425,363,11992,8164,8556,285,2905,381,16653,434,316,17799,18475,2863,1750,2414,993,1597,6815,6894,2131,316,6062,29948,21337,2441,267,29889,6298,966,339,4999,454,20674,2488,29892,28602,2488,712,1444,26099,29892,8164,17631,2376,261,12563,872,9484,1926,2131,1671,7877,3717,261,316,10984,2993,1775,4894,2993,29889,9353,454,25915,316,611,266,17449,29892,1601,1203,361,707,316,13942,29877,2496,553,6062,29948,21337,26957,29892,23459,743,2123,1721,375,316,425,5469,29892,14344,29899,455,27299,336,427,316,1506,1199,316,2967,1671,7877,3717,261,818,425,363,11992,553,3038,2540,899,7147,3669,2701,634,24233,3794,634,553,301,14785,2894,3783,1750,724,609,22
