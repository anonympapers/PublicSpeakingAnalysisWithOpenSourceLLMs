{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-08T01:39:12.274115956Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would score this speech a 3 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker does present some convincing arguments and reasons to support their message, but there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported.\n\nOne strength of the speech is that the speaker provides specific examples and data to support their claims about the importance of addressing economic social issues. For instance, they mention the agreement signed between Australia and France regarding the fabrication of submarines without exploiting workers for years, which results in a significant reduction of GDP. This type of concrete evidence can help convince listeners of the speaker's message.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported. For example, the speaker makes a claim about the water crisis in Australia without providing any context or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's argument that the economy is the most important aspect of society seems overly simplistic and does not take into account other important factors such as social justice and environmental sustainability.\n\nOverall, while the speech presents some convincing arguments, it could benefit from more rigorous reasoning and support for its claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,315,29915,342,966,12278,1179,14858,5059,275,29892,2971,279,634,260,30057,1912,1750,3435,1661,4991,743,4625,316,4662,280,1295,29889,2664,14979,23435,1750,269,29915,342,9577,19398,3911,634,439,29915,2719,1424,294,277,966,20542,7907,966,10890,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,966,23837,583,5374,1338,29892,966,904,4068,29879,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,29892,274,29915,342,9577,4100,29889,2664,4292,9230,634,425,15253,347,5374,1338,325,609,301,29915,5474,9577,25595,358,29889,2664,1766,23469,735,1277,10120,425,11896,1190,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,1465,454,4092,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,301,29915,11569,1690,272,882,316,796,536,1481,980,302,29915,342,2331,10814,1671,966,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,29889,2664,1437,558,1169,5374,1338,302,29915,342,2331,21394,270,29915,287,3409,29948,1671,1437,699,276,443,12471,17239,12128,7853,519,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,712,980,302,29915,342,2331,1950,1671,534,8885,425,11896,29889,21678,29920,29899,14167,29872,1277,10120,425,11896,316,301,29915,29948,4599,347,5264,427,2852,566,631,301,29915,10126,309,392,553,10273,29948,558,1169,634,534,8885,966,10273,293,532,2658,29889,1174,16132,29892,5278,10273,293,532,2658,1863,296,29889,2581,534,8885,1794,425,11896,2637,966,23837,583,5374,1338,634,966,904,4068,29879,29889,8748,16134,424,29892,1671,339,7768,454,23837,347,5264,29973,1720,343,263,818,19601,6303,1804,29948,427,15017,2637,301,29915,22537,347,634,966,3444,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,316,425,18187,362,316,9411,5898,29899,29885,2749,424,1750,1283,276,2665,267,7209,7930,417,347,1190,553,8595,29889,29871,30219,29874,2453,329,2970,4029,11710,29889,751,29915,342,29899,346,1750,409,21714,29973,1720,286,29915,294,2386,993,443,23837,347,1750,27435,2947,1671,1487,553,7930,371,29899,558,1169,5374,1338,1750,707,425,27219,533,270,29915,348,29871,29946,29900,29995,427,1841,700,428,316,402,2736,29889,9353,454,27666,10996,29892,29871,4277,2453,329,2970,443,23837,347,9577,4100,707,25732,277,361,29889,838,943,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,14531,553,7600,1750,269,29915,309,343,263,301,29915,29948,4599,347,25881,707,9577,4100,634,4625,28643,443,7048,27774,532,2658,29889,315,29915,342,818,8556,316,10420,261,818,301,29915,3496,381,634,427,27516,443,18551,1841,535,5553,631,316,1437,3511,454,23837,1387,29889,8748,274,29915,342,2331,856,315,29915,14386,1083,262,29889,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,445,12032,263,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,947,2198,777,17953,3277,6273,322,9590,304,2304,1009,2643,29892,541,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,13,13,6716,9324,310,278,12032,338,393,278,25657,8128,2702,6455,322,848,304,2304,1009,16726,1048,278,13500,310,3211,292,17407,5264,5626,29889,1152,2777,29892,896,3585,278,17327,8794,1546,8314,322,3444,11211,278,18187,362,310,1014,3034,1475,1728,16035,11407,17162,363,2440,29892,607,2582,297,263,7282,20376,310,402,11191,29889,910,1134,310,18387,10757,508,1371,7602,1239,11621,414,310,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,884,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,29889,1152,1342,29892,278,25657,3732,263,5995,1048,278,4094,24161,297,8314,1728,13138,738,3030,470,10757,304,2304,445,5995,29889,19814,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2980,393,278,26504,338,278,1556,4100,9565,310,12459,2444,975,368,5466,4695,322,947,451,2125,964,3633,916,4100,13879,1316,408,5264,15426,322,29380,15075,475,3097,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,12032,22981,777,17953,3277,6273,29892,372,1033,14169,515,901,12912,20657,24481,322,2304,363,967,16726,29889],"total_duration":74112991303,"load_duration":174504,"prompt_eval_count":483,"prompt_eval_duration":41277147000,"eval_count":264,"eval_duration":32835175000}
