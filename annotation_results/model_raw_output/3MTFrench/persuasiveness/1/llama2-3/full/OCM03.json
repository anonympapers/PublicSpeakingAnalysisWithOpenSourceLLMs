{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-07T22:53:17.194008484Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using a combination of rhetorical devices, such as repetition (e.g., \"vent\" and \"t'a revoir\"), metaphors (\"the link to the earth\"), and emotional appeals (\"magic\"). They also provide clear examples and explanations of their arguments, making it easy for the audience to follow and understand.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the speaker could improve to make their message even more persuasive. For instance, they could provide more specific data or statistics to support their claims about the typicity of wine under appellation d'origine protégée. Additionally, the speaker could have addressed potential counterarguments or objections that audience members might have to their proposal. By anticipating and addressing these concerns, the speaker could have made their message even more compelling.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,4805,1765,29875,29892,10484,5606,29892,17188,21941,270,29915,524,575,2131,2535,3999,11486,29892,553,282,1575,634,316,11492,29889,5791,4292,6386,707,1354,282,1893,453,424,439,29915,309,409,5246,2225,802,6337,1981,1808,29889,478,681,454,1841,510,10080,634,270,29915,314,1792,4883,26809,29892,1444,325,1759,7890,610,1358,19398,29889,6803,21394,270,29915,14056,7890,29892,432,29915,326,22094,712,454,9712,29892,274,29915,342,10042,5646,1597,1045,17387,9221,29948,519,29892,818,623,5606,13241,427,11449,29892,427,19183,347,634,2535,1601,270,10500,29889,6803,19601,29892,454,9712,29892,274,29915,342,454,619,264,818,425,18249,29889,751,392,7890,24618,2663,29920,427,325,647,473,2017,610,1358,316,3999,325,2708,29892,316,3999,325,27360,29892,316,1487,260,29915,29874,337,7869,29892,980,409,21714,21907,12784,316,2320,1387,29889,11948,274,29915,342,439,7768,454,260,29915,29874,337,7869,1577,315,29915,342,425,4145,1099,2285,270,29915,348,899,29892,270,29915,348,10784,271,634,316,544,15819,3165,9874,29889,1174,4092,29892,966,260,29915,29874,337,7869,818,478,2468,936,267,3435,8265,29876,375,610,966,263,459,2406,29892,966,623,514,800,270,29915,17234,17512,2445,2406,29892,1750,1437,4951,19047,6722,634,3440,373,8164,1391,533,868,9712,29889,11948,7015,263,459,2406,16784,19047,5695,712,454,260,29915,29874,337,7869,29892,6836,373,2947,6267,610,1358,325,647,473,29892,439,29915,265,9073,782,9712,29892,966,1559,23096,7209,269,29915,264,1841,295,16530,5289,29892,7096,818,9411,29889,478,681,4078,29920,274,29915,342,443,7006,4191,26814,470,29892,26814,269,16581,29889,478,681,8992,29920,8164,29899,5474,966,286,30037,4467,26809,29892,3503,2331,966,286,30037,4467,923,345,1314,29889,8748,6079,29892,980,427,2947,316,6701,1671,966,9712,270,29915,932,3610,362,29889,1174,5246,29892,427,260,29915,279,307,381,29892,274,29915,342,4191,1597,6815,11449,316,9712,29889,8748,15093,707,443,316,11449,1465,611,266,17449,29892,373,301,29915,932,1808,29892,611,2393,293,2131,29889,2598,541,29892,274,29915,342,316,534,8885,1597,8774,386,356,1671,2852,566,631,425,2393,293,2131,316,1391,1169,5898,623,3610,362,270,29915,17234,17512,2445,1318,29889,15981,425,7199,9030,29892,3503,5695,6628,1314,7890,427,610,1358,29889,365,29915,1131,8837,712,432,29915,4422,895,29892,274,29915,342,301,29915,24209,344,7209,269,29915,279,12836,29889,438,1481,29892,980,1302,30095,371,868,9712,1671,425,10466,29892,1444,872,275,29889,11948,10042,316,1437,700,2265,29892,980,21668,409,926,261,966,9892,1912,5155,29892,3667,7608,966,289,24729,8774,386,2631,29889,9353,611,266,17449,29892,1444,14405,316,28374,6987,316,301,29915,24209,344,7209,269,29915,279,12836,29892,2535,10741,26520,1379,316,1437,700,4838,332,29892,454,5646,1190,1597,270,6619,457,270,29915,932,3610,362,1841,1595,347,1465,301,29915,348,553,2298,22114,325,647,1849,868,9122,29892,454,25407,270,29915,542,2124,29875,29889,315,29915,342,439,29915,1540,260,1690,1318,454,2298,1274,6269,538,1465,611,266,17449,29889,315,29915,14386,316,1539,2484,966,325,647,272,787,782,8442,868,1889,375,29889,1704,2257,3435,316,7006,712,425,7319,7334,293,2131,29892,2257,27965,1314,4799,316,11449,29889,2581,966,7468,12866,364,465,13365,1318,610,623,3610,362,1671,966,1006,307,914,1190,301,29915,442,538,29892,634,1190,6267,9712,29889,315,4727,29948,19601,443,11107,316,325,647,272,787,29892,301,29915,1947,647,272,263,2393,293,2131,29892,29871,4277,5246,2298,712,29871,29896,29947,29900,1473,267,29889,11948,7907,11469,1209,29948,553,26893,818,1045,533,6267,610,1772,29892,1444,966,7468,1410,7324,29948,1224,443,7931,370,25290,3817,1671,1437,699,276,966,1559,23096,7209,269,29915,279,12836,2393,1387,316,6267,9712,29889,13861,439,7768,29892,966,325,647,272,787,270,29915,29948,700,29883,1886,2395,818,425,2453,434,29892,634,16455,344,29920,7015,1559,23096,1671,25497,276,818,425,1139,29892,2257,9712,707,2393,1387,316,26814,623,3610,362,29889,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,7907,11469,11465,29948,2535,553,1644,13116,316,301,647,272,787,634,724,1730,553,3533,4285,316,4837,29879,316,9712,29892,1444,7199,1975,6628,1314,7015,13830,5216,7545,29892,6267,619,264,782,15115,634,10713,1178,2925,553,4771,564,374,1338,29889,11948,454,5882,29892,
