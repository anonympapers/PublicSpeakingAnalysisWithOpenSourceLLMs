{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-07T18:51:30.231695381Z","response":"\nBased on the transcript provided, I would give a score of 3 out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and parallelism to make their message more convincing. However, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous and well-supported by evidence.\n\nThe speaker's use of emotional language and personal anecdotes helps to engage the audience and build rapport. They also provide specific examples and scenarios to illustrate their points, which makes their message more relatable and easier to understand.\n\nHowever, there are some moments where the speaker's arguments could be more substantiated. For instance, the claim that the presses used in the experiment were able to produce results that were \"au nord\" of the standard without providing any evidence or data to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker's assertion that their colleagues are not working as hard as they could be without providing any context or comparison to back up this claim.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in their persuasive techniques, there is room for improvement in terms of providing more evidence and substantiation to support their arguments.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1720,6303,1597,10098,1465,443,696,20030,658,262,29892,443,534,2488,363,914,265,1750,24304,27275,29892,443,3058,29889,7747,13137,29899,23088,427,20744,6303,6079,3710,300,568,29892,980,452,610,854,6096,2331,1597,289,7293,4021,2131,29889,28079,267,966,2930,17893,439,29915,309,363,479,10978,29892,325,895,29892,1559,301,29915,2521,29892,427,867,265,482,29892,6303,5646,2143,375,29948,634,302,29915,275,29899,30001,29899,29880,29915,348,553,21090,29889,315,29915,14386,1487,270,2663,425,2258,1082,25235,17402,29889,10016,904,941,412,23309,1750,409,5246,427,626,609,29892,454,11510,284,1750,363,479,1249,19154,286,1435,29892,274,29915,342,5321,30000,13000,29892,3477,488,29889,1763,29875,992,309,30001,427,289,11992,1318,29892,5246,12866,16794,818,8556,1750,263,1029,898,553,14884,18142,1512,944,544,5903,375,1671,553,1518,4894,2063,1436,267,29889,1174,1243,424,427,266,290,1893,284,29892,5291,1671,3417,269,29915,331,2139,1080,10814,3709,15243,878,15340,29892,301,29915,29948,386,4582,8819,362,29889,28532,5582,818,15243,270,29915,990,16063,424,29892,454,363,914,265,409,11529,29892,634,5146,29874,782,19590,5162,966,6987,316,503,1943,16589,818,29889,11948,454,363,914,265,6309,818,13275,24127,29892,1444,2453,1314,9073,4883,3686,1759,1190,3965,21136,1808,29892,5844,17449,634,712,1444,1236,1314,2535,301,29915,524,28286,16035,1524,425,734,295,631,1671,2298,270,29915,513,6430,21642,29889,315,29915,342,712,432,29915,279,4401,2535,4883,3965,267,29892,29871,29906,29900,29900,22609,270,29915,14531,782,6701,6896,499,271,712,4883,3300,533,782,9775,327,29892,18729,286,29915,296,336,332,1249,712,1444,301,29915,1794,1950,1354,301,29915,265,592,434,29892,270,29915,29877,30071,409,21714,29899,9161,316,282,2747,316,1243,316,17508,29874,13639,868,282,355,29884,29889,1720,832,29874,18916,1190,7015,3965,267,29892,443,2117,371,332,7744,29948,1671,592,432,9945,782,6628,1314,966,14231,16797,743,29889,8748,2535,7732,1869,414,1190,301,29915,449,453,482,22003,1249,29892,274,29915,342,425,1437,5404,1750,425,2298,29188,1249,29889,1720,1518,1064,2073,29874,7015,3965,267,1190,20075,743,1190,4239,29871,29896,29900,29900,4047,5326,4224,1132,2406,1465,425,21258,29889,951,1243,269,29915,29948,1464,1056,277,2560,29892,3503,2331,5466,2488,29892,24618,3417,1808,634,4047,5326,2637,4239,15284,2993,301,275,29889,951,363,914,265,12111,1564,23068,818,5278,1518,4894,663,29892,966,1828,14228,868,878,15340,3477,488,818,872,10466,29889,383,2344,454,15121,283,634,966,2930,17893,1661,14670,267,29892,14984,7015,23876,15777,427,4951,782,6218,29889,11948,2637,8714,29892,7015,5321,20608,1041,29892,11797,2143,262,993,10713,3686,1759,29889,8748,270,29915,14559,1828,14228,29892,1444,5663,8885,1759,2535,24113,29892,3503,1671,454,6701,1775,4894,585,29892,1671,454,6701,878,15340,29892,818,18729,452,409,8164,439,29915,309,707,454,2298,25947,15340,29889,7747,5321,30000,13000,868,301,29915,30057,1030,29892,274,29915,342,18097,6701,6267,289,5059,327,29892,3503,966,24618,1503,29892,2637,23778,29892,452,3435,2331,316,9201,29892,2535,13545,14231,634,13545,8595,29889,853,8694,29892,3516,25404,454,8714,6722,5646,16933,1841,3820,29948,29889,951,363,914,265,2062,275,12866,6555,29892,634,980,325,1249,439,29915,1540,540,545,1509,634,5644,262,316,5697,1169,11619,1446,29889,1174,4951,856,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,2367,263,8158,310,29871,29941,714,310,29871,29945,363,278,20408,294,20193,310,278,12032,29889,450,25657,17583,3913,364,9188,272,936,9224,1316,408,21159,654,322,8943,1608,304,1207,1009,2643,901,17953,3277,29889,2398,29892,727,526,777,10161,988,278,24481,1033,367,901,12912,20657,322,1532,29899,23765,491,10757,29889,13,13,1576,25657,29915,29879,671,310,23023,1848,4086,322,7333,385,687,29881,4769,6911,304,3033,482,278,20026,322,2048,13659,29889,2688,884,3867,2702,6455,322,21846,304,28475,1009,3291,29892,607,3732,1009,2643,901,1104,17219,322,6775,304,2274,29889,13,13,17245,29892,727,526,777,19462,988,278,25657,29915,29879,6273,1033,367,901,5960,3656,630,29889,1152,2777,29892,278,5995,393,278,3965,267,1304,297,278,7639,892,2221,304,7738,2582,393,892,376,585,6218,29908,310,278,3918,1728,13138,738,10757,470,848
