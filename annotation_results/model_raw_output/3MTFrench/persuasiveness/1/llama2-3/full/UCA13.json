{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-07T21:57:28.626636624Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would score the speech a 2 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness. The speaker's message is not particularly convincing or well-crafted. There are several reasons for this:\n\n1. Lack of evidence: The speaker makes several claims about the effectiveness of their method without providing any concrete evidence to support them. This lack of evidence makes it difficult to take their claims seriously.\n2. Unclear reasoning: The speaker's reasoning is not rigorous or well-explained. They make statements such as \"it's fresh\" and \"it's doable\" without providing any context or explanation for why these statements are true.\n3. Lack of focus: The speaker jumps around between different topics without focusing on a specific message or goal. This makes it difficult to follow their train of thought and evaluate their argument effectively.\n4. Overuse of filler words: The speaker uses filler words such as \"um\" and \"you know\" frequently, which can make them sound uncertain or unprepared.\n\nOverall, the speaker's message is not persuasive because they fail to provide clear evidence or well-reasoned arguments to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,24352,6139,29901,323,3289,29968,11759,29923,4387,403,1301,924,310,278,970,4180,2183,297,278,10014,2190,7187,24290,4004,29889,1763,2274,920,14707,372,29892,671,278,6139,310,278,9927,5439,297,278,4004,360,7833,1430,13381,29889,25538,6732,16786,697,1353,408,385,1234,448,445,1353,338,263,8158,322,372,756,304,367,2183,2729,373,278,6287,5439,297,278,317,5454,1307,4004,5586,29903,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,13780,2725,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657,29973,4514,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2453,1321,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,5373,413,328,279,1146,29773,29871,30169,1032,343,481,29885,9010,29871,30019,284,30130,30169,29873,30130,29895,29889,29871,30309,29884,413,267,262,413,328,279,1146,29773,413,277,568,29871,30276,30253,413,2142,557,277,941,343,481,29885,9010,501,29909,29999,3352,2606,30364,30412,1388,15296,4393,3162,19242,383,3781,1049,30130,29892,2443,31203,12528,316,30200,309,29892,437,30200,284,330,680,346,30200,326,29889,6629,29911,8574,6269,3365,343,554,29892,413,913,279,343,554,29889,289,10077,29943,6530,31198,25334,352,332,398,560,8623,6940,262,1010,326,311,5609,2453,21159,12737,911,5478,1175,2679,4404,5951,839,381,4404,1258,295,326,4514,518,29914,25580,29962,13,29933,1463,373,278,1301,924,4944,29892,306,723,8158,278,12032,263,29871,29906,714,310,29871,29945,297,4958,310,20408,294,20193,29889,450,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,10734,17953,3277,470,1532,29899,17293,287,29889,1670,526,3196,9590,363,445,29901,13,13,29896,29889,365,547,310,10757,29901,450,25657,3732,3196,16726,1048,278,2779,20193,310,1009,1158,1728,13138,738,18387,10757,304,2304,963,29889,910,10225,310,10757,3732,372,5189,304,2125,1009,16726,25798,29889,13,29906,29889,853,8551,24481,29901,450,25657,29915,29879,24481,338,451,12912,20657,470,1532,29899,4548,433,1312,29889,2688,1207,9506,1316,408,376,277,29915,29879,10849,29908,322,376,277,29915,29879,437,519,29908,1728,13138,738,3030,470,8252,363,2020,1438,9506,526,1565,29889,13,29941,29889,365,547,310,8569,29901,450,25657,432,17204,2820,1546,1422,23820,1728,12789,4746,373,263,2702,2643,470,7306,29889,910,3732,372,5189,304,1101,1009,7945,310,2714,322,14707,1009,2980,17583,29889,13,29946,29889,6811,1509,310,5445,261,3838,29901,450,25657,3913,5445,261,3838,1316,408,376,398,29908,322,376,6293,1073,29908,13672,29892,607,508,1207,963,6047,17999,470,443,15287,1965,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,278,25657,29915,29879,2643,338,451,20408,294,573,1363,896,4418,304,3867,2821,10757,470,1532,29899,23147,287,6273,304,2304,1009,16726,29889],"total_duration":67836790646,"load_duration":198117,"prompt_eval_count":420,"prompt_eval_duration":35592539000,"eval_count":263,"eval_duration":32243611000}
