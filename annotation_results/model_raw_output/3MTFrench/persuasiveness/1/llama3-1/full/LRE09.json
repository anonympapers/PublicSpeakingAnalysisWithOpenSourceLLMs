{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T00:37:57.533985596Z","response":"Based on the dimension \"In your opinion, how persuasive is the speech in this transcript, i.e., do the person effectively craft a convincing message? Is their reasoning rigorous?\" I would give a score of 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker uses a conversational tone and shares personal anecdotes to make the topic more relatable and engaging. They also use metaphors (e.g., comparing a g√¢teau recipe to finding the right temperature model) to help explain complex concepts in an accessible way. The reasoning appears to be rigorous, as the speaker provides concrete examples and compares their findings with measurements taken at a pool.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that the speech lacks a clear structure or conclusion. The speaker jumps between topics (patisserie, temperature models, environmental impact) without explicitly linking them together or summarizing their main points. Nevertheless, the persuasive power of the speech lies in its ability to engage the audience and make complex ideas more approachable, which I believe is achieved effectively for the most part.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,9189,30714,409,96586,9952,41091,5019,20028,653,46110,7364,13,38891,89,45325,11,9189,12584,89,3869,1208,68468,483,20188,1604,13,4366,51173,11,73103,39723,82133,3625,60404,9952,3625,14480,5019,917,9484,265,653,29005,70,978,11,272,17771,326,39982,1553,11,27549,1826,74817,8047,13,41621,10390,655,514,44630,7010,326,93847,11,27549,1826,51651,11,934,80720,51651,324,11,9189,628,647,10333,13,2998,3460,519,11,9189,39904,89,77558,1208,2960,46140,30945,2428,8065,1488,11,653,25500,45640,409,282,372,8047,3460,409,1208,88768,8047,13,41621,62299,665,1400,12339,11,1841,27549,308,17771,44093,6502,81682,8047,13,41621,7631,10333,934,80720,1826,514,55520,9465,1208,2960,46140,30945,2428,1880,1208,68468,483,11,1880,14707,11,4502,1208,2960,46140,30945,2428,34501,818,11,39043,5019,13826,2084,1208,68468,483,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,3489,438,389,8175,265,514,3460,3930,42775,11,389,1437,29097,26725,665,27584,27138,11,1208,3678,1800,27197,13,27058,75871,265,3869,1208,62163,11,951,2960,46140,30945,8467,7230,84,15844,15132,682,372,14014,13,34447,28463,11,514,38847,951,1615,20372,811,14240,278,12328,14014,5019,3625,67965,2053,11,5019,3625,1672,2058,3869,48416,8977,28130,1615,20372,367,13,622,34155,39587,7591,21200,978,409,48021,665,2035,653,72601,7930,29557,409,841,6502,13826,2084,3625,68468,1572,10878,519,20662,84411,536,11,10071,8065,32150,556,409,2848,2058,951,84411,2601,308,6,2985,1439,6033,326,6,8188,1880,6033,1208,1615,20372,367,3369,4558,22221,13,24703,46110,7364,11,7010,1208,68468,483,11,9189,1046,299,1082,89,1208,281,10515,635,11,274,6,57558,14707,11,4864,9189,22114,7010,7643,36105,13,622,34155,6233,648,409,20028,653,342,69628,2933,8065,72476,266,11,272,17771,1647,68468,483,62799,13,34447,503,34155,6502,8811,409,1421,47003,11,4864,63762,6502,21965,1208,79071,14896,13,14465,35881,579,409,326,31769,74458,13,14465,45324,22626,84440,11,4864,35456,82,1208,3117,483,11,514,924,846,11,4864,296,19010,853,11,4864,66517,21901,265,514,72476,266,11,4864,757,282,788,11,42138,51854,4043,2852,11,5310,42827,11,503,34155,100162,514,342,69628,2933,86966,13,27058,757,13510,11,951,80080,11,1647,42775,5019,1208,259,24201,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,1208,3352,285,62243,13,14465,52571,1208,51651,1421,6672,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,3846,308,17771,6502,653,342,69628,2933,11,10071,1208,2798,14081,1598,409,326,93847,409,1208,68468,483,13,5034,1421,6672,1826,514,83597,1744,4864,52571,3869,7591,23827,261,1880,7930,757,29557,2221,409,5935,261,1208,2798,14081,1598,409,326,93847,13,27058,45602,11,4864,9517,981,2439,3869,951,82134,81336,15433,4167,11,2798,14081,1598,409,326,6,1334,11,2798,14081,1598,3930,10594,11,2854,3748,978,409,326,6,1334,11,6033,35597,514,13026,409,3399,59307,13,2998,1370,543,51453,11,503,34155,86595,978,951,11083,1439,1765,6316,68468,483,665,40761,13,14465,94297,45575,93455,1208,2798,14081,1598,11,11083,7889,1880,1208,1391,14081,1598,5935,261,13,24703,7930,757,29557,409,7591,23827,261,514,49348,83597,13,3489,438,4864,326,34155,11,4864,94297,45575,46524,514,4545,887,63497,5019,13826,2084,3625,22253,1354,13,19421,4864,5213,6364,1370,514,4545,409,3846,48416,28674,44351,11,326,6,58400,11,514,16081,294,6,69331,7709,1880,1370,1208,27584,13402,11,326,6,58400,513,1765,326,41901,2842,40280,13,80905,514,38900,1826,2262,13,19421,42676,4864,9517,981,285,11,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,7673,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,5829,264,7669,1697,16630,323,13551,4443,94066,311,1304,279,8712,810,1375,15436,323,23387,13,2435,1101,1005,31768,1105,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,264,342,69628,2933,11363,311,9455,279,1314,9499,1646,8,311,1520,10552,6485,19476,304,459,15987,1648,13,578,33811,8111,311,387,47999,11,439,279,19114,5825,14509,10507,323,43565,872,14955,449,22323,4529,520,264,7463,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,220,20,704,315,220,20,374,430,279,8982,37856,264,2867,6070,477,17102,13,578,19114,35308,1990,13650,320,79,3689,62243,11,9499,4211,11,12434,5536,8,2085,21650,31799,1124,3871,477,29385,4954,872,1925,3585,13,35053,11,279,66343,2410,315,279,8982,15812,304,1202,5845,311,16988,279,10877,323,1304,6485,6848,810,5603,481,11,902,358,4510,374,17427,13750,369,279,1455,961,13,128009],"total_durati
