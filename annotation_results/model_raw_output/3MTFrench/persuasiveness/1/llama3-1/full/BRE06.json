The use of personal anecdotes and analogies (e.g. comparing the wasps' behavior to the movie Alien) makes the topic more relatable and interesting. The speaker also effectively uses rhetorical questions to engage the audience and encourages them to think about the complexity of the issue.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that some parts of the speech may be difficult for non-specialists in biology to follow, such as the technical details about wasp anatomy and laboratory experiments. However, overall, the speaker presents their research in an accessible and engaging way, making it easy to understand the importance and potential impact of their work.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,1952,264,1370,86633,326,98279,4099,1744,1208,38317,13488,951,924,75004,653,28800,4046,376,5637,13,3489,80720,308,59858,76235,11,1370,51173,11,7591,79884,2442,57375,3625,86696,6183,21237,951,27080,288,949,507,2005,11,10071,4502,272,17771,5019,7591,70,5100,35597,5636,409,829,9189,5621,817,6816,1082,8065,1194,336,1725,11,42676,3900,9189,13,12095,11,22299,41091,11,9189,86807,89,3625,6816,5014,11,274,1815,89,1744,3625,18757,1056,26692,28463,11,665,5589,11,76776,1208,274,79351,951,6816,5014,11,934,35329,66304,55162,10036,296,4091,3846,934,81991,3611,64,581,75,404,3625,6136,288,13,27058,841,6502,75144,26633,61257,11,3625,17744,38647,513,15132,490,263,5512,5553,951,27080,288,1880,841,5906,951,18757,1056,26692,13,9605,326,54386,917,6853,33403,6491,38672,5919,11,3846,15132,409,1332,26089,2482,1888,822,645,7930,513,84163,282,5757,91640,7010,3625,15235,285,409,18757,1056,26692,11,1880,36670,306,43153,46106,7010,409,8811,75876,2249,5310,1769,13,1252,90551,92174,33403,6491,38672,5919,513,52895,375,45575,7010,46777,18757,1056,2298,514,7591,3415,556,409,326,55624,57663,1880,1913,275,1370,514,259,8977,13,12095,9189,308,6,52659,6502,33614,514,4632,11,14925,26193,11,4160,321,6496,3869,75249,39043,25692,594,36501,13,13789,11,1208,44178,16271,11,272,17771,1744,11083,33403,6491,38672,5919,28068,306,514,436,57332,951,16265,8839,13,13789,11,4160,321,6496,11,389,264,934,81991,326,9011,9211,84871,409,33403,6491,38672,5919,5019,1760,978,1414,12155,6816,5014,13,16233,1739,1744,11,665,20272,11,389,264,72006,326,9011,9211,951,2606,4918,409,1888,822,645,11,3625,18757,1056,26692,2018,11942,3869,43036,261,13,1708,1105,11,1647,719,11,272,17771,409,60946,265,87320,27750,33403,6491,38672,5919,841,28068,306,6502,514,436,57332,13,19421,39015,11,4864,36731,14707,2262,409,1744,951,52571,1759,1880,1615,65848,14014,28130,1841,65220,3869,14240,664,1291,1208,6160,38469,951,18757,1056,26692,13,2998,67781,11,46152,14848,1647,376,978,665,9511,67763,1744,76076,18757,1056,26692,97958,2700,38647,409,293,533,35285,11,13171,409,3625,1760,978,1414,45973,43153,61624,1238,13,19421,11,39587,4160,321,6496,11,41091,5019,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,5320,2249,47929,4502,3846,39904,1208,27584,14896,9952,3625,18757,1056,26692,7930,274,6,33019,17187,8065,1448,5512,1291,13,4418,66,11,42676,514,1194,336,1725,17782,11,4864,39904,665,3941,523,13559,324,3273,331,25121,11,1880,4864,41958,3869,1208,523,13559,8065,18757,1056,2298,46206,951,2027,38647,409,6816,5014,7010,43905,1208,9822,11,1208,6033,71,25045,951,6816,5014,8065,44989,18757,1056,26692,841,296,31769,331,34531,13,1611,54606,8065,9511,67763,11,4864,296,1441,665,2035,653,4046,3532,425,409,18757,1056,26692,11,1880,4864,88817,331,2852,3625,293,533,35285,7930,5019,969,1188,36875,13327,1001,3625,1760,978,1414,45973,12155,33403,6491,38672,5919,13,4418,66,11,5019,45602,11,503,34155,11741,1339,28130,1008,10610,11,1880,4864,1239,42441,4502,409,1208,1008,10610,11,293,533,28154,268,11,3846,6636,7010,3625,27080,288,13,2998,51092,11,503,6,8629,1082,653,12896,11,18757,1056,26692,45973,6502,3869,1666,6491,38672,5919,7010,6316,712,25108,668,409,64032,376,285,11,1880,4864,42463,3625,18757,1056,26692,33403,13109,13,14465,66517,45602,5019,951,18757,1056,26692,7930,1370,951,293,533,35285,1880,951,18757,1056,26692,7930,308,41901,2700,306,6502,13,33150,1620,11,503,34155,1647,376,978,934,31109,16948,4558,346,409,18757,1056,2298,43989,369,79507,1760,19395,8047,1370,951,293,533,35285,13,4418,66,11,1208,463,331,8511,14240,2070,11,272,17771,409,46131,4502,3625,2278,21041,294,31769,72905,951,1043,288,1370,33403,6491,38672,5919,13171,409,42533,1215,1208,31807,4011,3930,1666,978,65,533,35285,13,4418,66,11,20662,87810,11,272,17771,653,51173,409,1208,6485,13109,3930,55520,13,1952,76605,69241,9779,951,61257,1370,951,27080,288,13,4366,64965,11,10071,389,513,17634,42463,1744,514,45740,2530,1826,513,35030,276,65,30872,1557,13,19421,39587,11,272,17771,5019,45602,1744,326,54386,264,63669,409,52571,1759,22299,41091,11,9952,653,13615,275,7010,1208,76680,30303,1880,653,13615,275,7010,1208,95234,13,386,23034,4502,514,42775,1765,951,924,75004,28463,1765,79,1466,519,1744,951,293,533,35285,409,18757,1056,26692,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,323,279,13167,330,32390,84,300,13071,315,279,8982,498,358,1053,4478,420,586,5178,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,11,1405,220,16,374,539,520,682,66343,323,220,20,374,1
