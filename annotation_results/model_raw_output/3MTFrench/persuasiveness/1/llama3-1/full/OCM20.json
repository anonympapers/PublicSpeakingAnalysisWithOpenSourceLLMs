The speaker effectively uses storytelling to convey the importance of addressing these issues and presents a simple yet effective solution for valorizing the waste by extracting anarangine, a valuable compound.\n\nThe speech is well-structured, with a clear introduction, development, and conclusion. The speaker's use of rhetorical devices, such as metaphors (\"l'anarangine refuse d'essorter facilement des épaules\") and vivid descriptions (\"un total des plus de 40 millions de tonnes des déchets d'égrume\"), adds depth and emotional resonance to the narrative.\n\nThe only aspect that prevents me from giving a perfect score is that the speech may benefit from more rigorous reasoning and evidence-based arguments. While the speaker presents some compelling points, the audience is not provided with concrete data or statistics to support their claims. Additionally, some of the technical terms used in the speech, such as \"l'anarangine\" and \"les déchets d'égrume,\" may be unfamiliar to non-experts, which could limit the speech's impact.\n\nOverall, I believe that this public performance is highly persuasive and effectively conveys the importance of addressing environmental issues through creative solutions.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,445,1105,593,503,49152,13109,46206,41091,11,665,9553,2428,11,4864,66283,978,43582,11,653,17744,12844,7930,54206,220,17,12,17,12,17,5019,44031,2353,13,12103,2626,11,15572,68,25945,14707,11,1880,951,27138,11,389,50590,8541,84,220,17,12,17,11,15878,19189,84,1370,25400,11,46777,46415,665,9553,2428,13,32429,97507,11,3900,47090,296,19010,4091,1208,1028,447,4618,9952,79071,14896,13,426,1116,11,43582,1826,25945,2262,9952,4538,503,4838,11,10071,3900,308,17771,6502,4684,4558,79507,8795,1339,13,1252,67781,11,3869,20662,36897,5788,409,503,4838,11,1826,4189,978,8065,6800,409,10484,13109,294,31769,2629,25108,77,8047,409,503,4838,13,362,47929,11,1744,46777,15395,78,409,503,4838,54206,3154,519,409,7591,331,1441,3869,342,52424,5019,281,30872,75,11,87695,467,11,1880,4502,389,1860,1854,818,26725,3625,4865,1391,4558,67,417,11,653,2860,951,5636,409,220,1272,11990,409,52021,951,7591,331,1441,294,31769,911,3972,1880,4864,308,6,1138,5615,818,7010,3625,38900,46777,76132,13,3959,7591,331,1441,11,934,2053,294,6,316,9011,8696,11,1208,5019,67,102504,316,978,1497,687,1188,16968,37622,266,951,40321,5512,2307,92759,15844,11,22299,326,62595,277,526,483,13,69327,514,3937,326,6,20243,1130,4189,978,3869,951,513,544,2852,2960,1441,25945,20940,22589,11,7294,3502,45864,67763,11,7294,16405,4223,67,2194,11,9313,3930,72601,32844,4378,325,4631,12267,13,27058,62998,6502,37622,978,11,409,326,6,39749,12339,409,1208,1069,2933,30,1611,30584,4558,385,69,13,92917,80259,11,326,62595,277,526,483,1826,25945,8811,483,13,46408,26122,294,6,434,371,261,51794,479,951,4046,6733,2482,11,653,3937,77807,5615,818,1880,45441,42587,978,951,75601,2601,25945,2804,15844,11,10071,71151,23008,6033,1499,5048,11,43582,9671,258,11,7930,308,17771,6502,13171,294,6,43114,404,3154,519,294,6,77217,5019,1826,85815,326,62595,277,526,483,11,3900,50590,503,41901,55002,901,98652,4382,11,8175,481,11,1880,91329,1640,2428,5019,14448,12329,27750,7591,331,1441,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,503,34155,31957,355,13,34447,4068,20028,3460,404,20662,459,277,526,483,30,1252,3937,5986,1056,5048,11,294,48968,12328,81,52009,1759,11,1880,294,6,434,306,12,8839,11,7930,7591,331,919,326,57286,285,57123,1880,503,57286,1604,11,12611,978,519,20662,22337,20243,1130,11,3869,934,3328,15878,46110,11,2098,355,11,272,17771,326,6,283,1565,265,13,393,9425,11,71357,11,389,27389,325,653,369,79507,3846,6502,11,5019,5066,556,28130,12046,579,11,1880,4160,321,6496,11,4068,934,81991,220,1954,4,294,62595,277,526,483,11,934,35329,841,326,26248,6502,11,1880,272,17771,9517,66353,375,294,22827,272,17771,12046,579,11741,1339,13,9605,514,65285,266,3709,61140,519,30,34447,653,47838,80259,17782,13,445,62595,277,526,483,296,55624,978,3458,30179,6960,7010,3846,12046,579,11741,1339,11,1208,7251,953,43989,83786,25108,52235,16968,409,2092,13,423,81979,40321,5512,11,326,6,546,88778,978,13,19421,22299,27549,308,26248,547,1437,42625,6502,326,93847,11,8065,39381,294,6,3457,951,46106,11,27549,66167,61387,8047,11,1046,299,75117,3869,42067,46110,25646,294,49963,285,57123,1880,503,57286,1604,5019,514,43014,27549,264,48488,294,22827,36252,1291,13,356,17771,7930,296,6,3342,5615,1557,409,326,6,277,20243,455,52424,13,11583,44397,19395,648,11,272,17771,1370,1339,961,425,11,16968,3846,46110,2598,1130,8162,1474,978,376,2428,11,1880,3608,333,1339,3869,26077,62827,11,1880,3846,934,80720,1826,3869,1028,282,3510,2428,11,272,17771,9517,66353,375,409,20662,308,6,277,526,483,4502,2442,97110,2442,84,30,27058,76826,11,1208,35881,299,9211,11,6033,326,6,35264,55852,11,1826,21548,5048,2249,514,17634,1133,951,65995,13,2998,51092,11,51913,1188,11,1880,514,757,852,1826,12,6496,1773,556,5636,11,1744,3869,1208,17576,8047,11,1208,1376,1130,1826,11,5019,31518,404,951,4371,12843,11,20028,951,35030,292,24469,11,1880,98054,7251,953,409,326,93847,11,477,519,11,3900,5019,969,14448,12329,3625,7617,288,10253,10484,35933,951,60227,7930,2558,285,306,11,1880,9189,7515,87624,9189,26725,665,51651,77323,13,432,434,17194,43582,11,503,34155,924,39015,5019,28816,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,83463,334,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,4438,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,7673,358,15806,279,586,5178,439,3146,19,14,20,334,13,198,198,791,19114,18911,264,2867,323,23387,19775,922,872,13123,449,459,29149,17276,7086,43582,11,889,12580,11774,5552,311,12571,6373,505,10804,263,5788,13,578,19114,13750,5829,48929,311,20599,279,12939,315,28118,1521,4
