{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T00:16:11.786748545Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I evaluate the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by sharing personal experiences and observations about the intuitive nature of technology and its impact on human behavior. The reasoning is rigorous and supported by concrete examples, such as the contrast between using an easy-to-use tablet versus a robotized machine at Peugeot. The speaker also demonstrates empathy for the operators who are struggling to adapt to new technologies and proposes solutions to make these tools more user-friendly.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the speech could benefit from some additional structure and clarity in its transitions between ideas. However, overall, the speaker's persuasive arguments and personal anecdotes make their message engaging and memorable.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,1744,20272,653,36963,33632,519,42676,389,25400,2322,6316,21354,668,7010,3625,69236,5019,1208,43905,55133,37291,13,61651,14707,25945,100198,11,3900,20272,3846,13033,68,13,5034,21354,668,1826,19227,1001,97301,333,1744,27584,653,33632,519,7930,308,26248,56316,24560,665,3729,9952,1208,1391,1466,1762,665,1685,593,9888,276,42625,13,356,17771,22299,4502,514,272,5976,2933,1880,1208,2869,38469,97958,6935,65,462,447,5512,11,22299,4502,3900,66517,1339,48901,294,22827,16968,13,5034,5780,1826,45575,514,33482,1133,409,326,77025,40807,13,46408,3698,1395,514,71132,11,27549,514,69241,332,84868,479,13,12095,1208,2869,38469,1826,14707,2267,635,11,27549,25692,39587,409,43406,653,45165,23349,961,97820,5019,326,6,87713,13,34447,1744,3846,1522,275,45575,11,87158,3625,12933,841,15132,6502,4502,97301,22589,1744,39043,13,3489,37907,15132,3625,1615,978,45045,1765,15265,4197,13109,949,29179,3457,3625,4860,1744,4864,757,17477,7010,11083,88817,8696,13,38891,89,5392,788,1370,51173,1744,9189,62299,1200,978,7853,324,1765,3625,523,4558,4978,409,97044,46206,5250,94522,1880,1744,20662,5780,274,17771,6502,6316,21354,668,11,10071,1208,17536,513,274,49455,12585,285,8047,9952,1208,88265,9189,3567,74466,5155,261,10071,8941,514,1400,5741,1826,294,31109,3930,35019,339,2727,13,33150,5636,259,35657,11,514,1400,5741,409,26633,3930,35019,339,2727,1370,81645,45441,50026,220,4728,1400,41476,409,3930,35019,339,2727,1370,9880,13,19421,14707,45575,11,4502,15265,348,1082,817,308,17771,6502,95234,11,1370,97301,333,11,6502,51794,3869,75144,11,4502,27549,308,17771,6502,514,33482,1133,409,15265,1560,40807,11,9189,47592,26633,10105,13,5034,55133,11,9189,45366,58673,15610,40970,83457,13,34447,7010,6316,93486,22299,653,28800,9880,11,6316,81645,46777,2132,42463,13,43359,607,1001,12,37526,308,17771,39587,6502,60019,6316,3072,13,5034,513,95959,6425,13,19421,665,20272,11,1208,86806,11,272,17771,1744,9189,5276,74466,15265,76407,409,58673,15610,13,9605,9189,39732,74466,8065,52962,1133,409,15265,704,321,11,10071,20662,18475,264,653,16081,19329,275,333,13,3341,20662,37291,11,272,17771,9189,7930,12584,89,409,35573,3698,1565,1880,1208,7015,483,409,15265,704,321,13,41621,12584,89,409,35573,296,17060,269,12329,951,44827,1880,23761,52309,333,8065,40970,409,9517,66,26803,5019,379,945,404,8065,5636,83457,13,350,35657,2442,412,569,11,3846,16081,19329,275,333,11,264,28800,3625,10405,11540,3916,13,27713,3242,2540,15265,14707,85815,1880,15265,5178,13,41621,12584,89,27584,25692,85815,8065,25646,294,22827,4545,665,436,5615,424,1208,85434,1880,594,25526,404,951,25595,77660,39929,326,98279,4099,294,93825,1765,5794,8047,13,41621,12584,89,28463,20028,951,56549,1759,6033,14707,951,79165,26317,60404,3869,326,31769,56745,11,1370,51173,13,9995,265,3869,4196,11,272,17771,409,20028,665,80444,1744,46206,5250,94522,20662,6900,11540,1604,45441,16961,8047,87451,1208,43656,951,1772,288,13,27058,39043,11,503,6,49133,3625,1200,978,7853,1759,9465,653,42775,1880,4864,3625,98896,11,503,6,44803,325,28130,52962,1133,1880,503,6,1748,57609,951,15082,39723,3900,29253,653,4046,11707,9465,514,52962,1133,951,12933,1880,3625,9604,265,951,1200,978,7853,1759,13,3959,15082,39723,3625,1200,978,7853,1759,97569,20028,653,5149,82113,42625,12267,5019,274,6,20311,3869,28130,704,321,13,2998,5589,11,4864,30714,951,10105,5019,1744,3625,348,1082,4881,12585,285,5512,1880,46106,704,8839,69125,3567,72,89810,409,45165,1018,4893,70175,294,41901,69,1821,22299,20662,21354,668,13,2998,294,81979,4751,288,11,503,34155,13458,16968,71357,10253,1200,978,7853,1759,409,64032,466,6316,3930,35019,339,2727,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,15806,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,11821,4443,11704,323,24654,922,279,42779,7138,315,5557,323,1202,5536,389,3823,7865,13,578,33811,374,47999,323,7396,555,14509,10507,11,1778,439,279,13168,1990,1701,459,4228,4791,25700,21354,19579,264,12585,1534,5780,520,5250,94522,13,578,19114,1101,32216,48451,369,279,20197,889,527,20558,311,10737,311,502,14645,323,55725,10105,311,1304,1521,7526,810,1217,22658,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,4832,5573,374,430,279,8982,1436,8935,505,1063,5217,6070,323,32373,304,1202,34692,1990,6848,13,4452,11,8244,11,279,19114,596,66343,6105,323,4443,94066,1304,872,1984,23387,323,33596,13,128009],"total_duration":5954849058,"load_duration":283065,"pro
