{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T00:11:58.91521907Z","response":"Based on the dimension \"In your opinion, how persuasive is the speech in this transcript, i.e., do the person effectively craft a convincing message? Is their reasoning rigorous?\" I would rate the persuasive power of the speech as 4 out of 5. The speaker presents a clear and logical argument about the importance of understanding the behavior of fissures and the impact of childhood experiences on adult behavior. They also provide specific examples and analogies to illustrate their points, making their message more engaging and easy to follow. Additionally, the speaker's use of rhetorical devices such as metaphors (e.g., \"l'enfance n'est pas le seul facteur qui d√©termine la fissure que l'on devient\") adds to the overall persuasive power of the speech. The only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that some parts of the speech seem slightly disconnected or unrelated to the main argument, which can make it harder to follow and less effective in convincing the audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,7010,653,40321,519,3930,88486,324,294,49152,290,13,64105,64,25692,9189,3429,66014,7505,258,13,34447,3900,47090,47929,1744,27750,40321,1821,15132,296,5014,3869,56949,951,864,84,2396,9952,3625,81786,348,3145,934,85217,97569,1089,7889,13,1611,3846,523,511,25692,12,6496,31307,665,23761,6316,11297,68,7930,25692,1097,804,6316,65396,22299,389,665,264,46939,4635,84,8811,75876,43765,13,4418,66,11,26633,4160,552,3284,13,5034,55133,11,389,3136,3869,19477,52750,951,40321,1821,50510,2852,11,7930,19861,12826,514,97418,409,326,49152,290,1880,39587,829,1615,20372,367,409,7930,274,17771,20272,934,54386,841,829,275,6502,9517,1072,556,326,6,37939,46429,12782,13,38437,519,934,6,2933,69572,88253,11,514,7710,264,28154,268,71925,6960,5636,409,220,18,4,951,4046,5287,1647,32106,645,409,7432,17,13,1611,2249,90272,4160,953,11,389,19477,3159,951,88486,1759,3869,2267,21041,665,864,52985,12782,16968,665,40192,66262,1208,77463,951,348,3145,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,503,55624,651,1188,13,9995,265,3869,5320,4618,11,272,17771,294,6,44803,805,3625,4499,4065,11,514,52962,1133,1880,514,83259,463,1557,409,1208,95159,554,13,27058,62998,513,17425,466,514,5636,6033,40970,83457,3869,76076,5415,409,829,17536,30,12535,43989,326,52152,27256,20099,1370,326,41901,2842,40280,934,35329,665,7364,30,41621,514,9517,5807,7379,89,30,14465,36731,8841,77828,951,95159,1439,13,46706,3625,6954,59307,6225,409,8841,38469,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,39587,3869,4538,33632,685,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,5019,6316,62827,409,95159,1439,1880,7930,1062,306,3869,326,31769,88198,325,324,294,22827,3869,272,6009,3091,588,2249,13,27058,45602,11,4864,1589,8047,6316,38920,95159,554,11,44829,4864,25400,917,6091,1744,951,4787,91678,5983,409,3846,934,80720,11412,1207,404,37953,409,4538,33632,685,11,1880,4864,23846,4538,52962,1133,3869,1208,62827,56430,13,14465,94297,45575,4046,74199,404,653,55520,9465,3625,21965,5634,2191,288,1207,321,4692,409,4538,33632,685,11,1880,4538,52962,1133,3869,6316,37291,56430,13,34447,22299,9189,9189,665,294,2182,89,11,326,41901,69,685,308,17771,6502,514,74206,2144,12844,7930,7591,5098,483,1208,95159,554,1744,326,54386,3567,1188,13,2009,83259,7010,514,43014,29449,95159,554,1826,4499,84,11,11412,44767,39929,6316,12939,11,3846,1744,503,6,26577,648,409,60946,265,7010,3625,19266,3095,46932,15844,13,19421,5019,45602,11,3900,47090,628,647,261,8065,1080,12844,409,1208,5634,20712,54401,294,31769,838,8977,3625,27650,9465,3625,19670,288,13,507,2005,11,4864,9189,36015,934,35329,47090,48908,55398,81991,39015,13,622,34155,39587,63669,294,22827,4046,20609,68,21438,5019,25400,20028,26725,27750,7151,729,13,2009,220,20,25500,490,263,13,356,17771,653,1046,29982,7853,324,409,220,22869,296,75104,409,30570,6263,978,16271,220,22869,296,75104,11,29557,61512,409,78422,52424,951,18803,2439,1630,220,1041,2606,81560,409,37291,5636,19428,1744,3625,8737,17724,294,6,454,6491,11,7930,82133,68226,30517,261,1208,5634,20712,1880,1370,1208,27584,13402,33537,978,84871,294,6,41540,811,1765,514,83259,1744,29449,95159,554,38646,11,1880,3625,6155,1673,288,934,80720,1207,275,13,435,2259,1001,11,27750,26633,13878,3930,34133,8841,1640,2428,409,29449,95159,554,11,665,9822,1880,83259,11,78871,57110,911,5512,7010,653,83597,67926,42625,278,1661,78129,7930,17317,71751,64,4538,52962,1133,16968,8065,1317,409,829,17536,13,435,2259,1001,11,272,17771,44351,1744,1208,8811,61375,409,31651,31651,426,15872,11412,6044,8977,3869,3846,1744,9189,11,951,46415,11,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,7673,358,1053,4478,279,66343,2410,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,13,578,19114,18911,264,2867,323,20406,5811,922,279,12939,315,8830,279,7865,315,95159,1439,323,279,5536,315,20587,11704,389,6822,7865,13,2435,1101,3493,3230,10507,323,24291,552,311,41468,872,3585,11,3339,872,1984,810,23387,323,4228,311,1833,13,23212,11,279,19114,596,1005,315,87068,7766,1778,439,31768,1105,320,68,13,70,2637,330,75,6,268,69,685,308,17771,6502,514,74206,2144,12844,7930,7591,5098,483,1208,95159,554,1744,326,54386,3567,1188,909,11621,311,279,8244,66343,2410,315,279,8982,13,578,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,220,20,704,315,220,20,374,430,1063,5596,315,279,8982,2873,10284,40186,477,46305,311,279,1925,5811,11,902,649,1304,433,16127,311
