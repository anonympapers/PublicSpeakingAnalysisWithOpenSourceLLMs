The reasoning is rigorous, with logical connections between the problems faced in the medical world and the potential solutions presented. The tone is engaging, and the use of rhetorical questions (\"Quelle pourrait ne pas survivre Ã  une ses Ariennes?\") adds emotional depth to the argument. However, some parts of the speech may be perceived as overly dramatic or alarmist, which slightly diminishes the overall persuasiveness.\n\nScore:
