{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T00:38:32.374391235Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would evaluate the persuasive power of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by presenting both sides of the argument and providing examples to support their claims. They also demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic, using technical terms like \"fertilisants de chimique\" and \"nitrates\" to emphasize their points. The speaker's reasoning is rigorous, as they present a clear comparison between chemical fertilizers and organic ones, highlighting the benefits of the latter.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that the speech could benefit from more concrete data or statistics to further reinforce the speakers' arguments. Additionally, while the speaker does a good job of engaging their audience, some parts of the speech feel a bit disjointed and could be improved with better transitional phrases. Overall, however, the speaker's persuasive power is strong, and I believe they would effectively convince many people of the benefits of organic fertilizers.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,281,556,11,22299,39043,11,39043,25692,23761,4017,5048,13,356,17771,66021,1744,272,17771,653,33632,519,1744,514,3197,841,25692,6502,75144,13,7695,47090,326,31769,49272,425,6033,326,31769,631,648,294,6,8629,44618,409,4538,409,43678,11,39043,264,653,33632,519,1744,514,3197,841,25692,75144,13,34447,39043,11,3846,308,17771,6502,5019,665,7187,409,38900,79380,25626,13,445,41901,7611,409,8834,121038,519,38094,2428,8065,65385,409,220,508,11,3869,6316,5916,11843,4091,13,16233,49806,978,11,653,4545,409,5788,409,326,6,12828,42725,11,1370,45973,11,272,17771,25945,665,3369,1279,13,7695,50590,48488,409,1615,978,45045,308,19395,5983,5019,326,41901,2842,40280,13,4366,51173,11,3625,4046,5287,409,56086,3869,67781,113147,11,66021,1744,220,3101,37291,5636,3288,1744,5636,3288,1744,27750,2362,288,11,1880,28463,951,81282,3930,25719,18071,8065,53052,409,2092,11,7930,14848,16513,978,7010,3625,308,1366,376,10574,8467,13,1708,1105,11,272,17771,75249,326,55624,618,1339,409,8834,121038,519,294,6,8629,2428,30,11876,42822,461,1880,1744,39043,25692,23761,5636,31914,580,1744,3625,8834,121038,1821,409,38094,2428,13,356,17771,653,64271,5019,1208,27584,2027,344,13109,294,49152,13603,40970,409,81282,3869,326,6,541,265,40970,409,1615,978,45045,308,19395,5983,11,7010,514,4545,13,19421,39043,11,272,17771,326,6,1735,333,409,296,55624,978,15760,13,356,17771,409,20028,665,7809,57288,409,326,31769,21264,582,13109,11,294,100017,409,326,6,1394,1295,11,409,3625,36214,285,1821,409,38094,2428,11,7930,15132,3869,2700,295,49733,3869,326,6,1138,344,290,11,1880,409,955,409,36214,285,1821,2942,8467,7930,15132,20272,1765,2035,49733,13,2009,25646,409,8216,409,326,6,391,403,367,1826,514,14869,325,4618,409,961,13,5250,332,85815,409,9189,47592,46939,69379,84,951,17744,38647,7930,42587,306,951,36214,285,1821,409,2942,8467,11,1370,51173,409,282,3972,1880,951,4039,12249,13,356,17771,83195,1744,3846,14707,1744,17317,11,1744,39043,46798,81,79738,14707,11,514,2092,1880,3625,6136,288,11,10071,6502,45973,514,9517,79,416,582,13109,11,1880,514,53052,409,961,11,272,17771,35597,25692,85815,305,10515,1814,13,42215,92215,23423,261,1744,3625,7591,331,1441,409,27240,2439,6033,27584,514,308,9769,10367,5019,4046,8783,261,665,436,57332,79380,3062,5019,514,53052,294,39982,9769,818,8791,17462,1880,409,3625,5568,5512,11,3625,281,15916,11,49733,7010,3625,71581,409,649,2194,924,846,3869,1208,436,62799,11,6033,3869,326,6,75876,15890,951,46106,17744,1439,13,356,17771,54312,1744,308,17771,6502,1744,665,83981,266,949,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,15806,279,66343,2410,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,32644,2225,11314,315,279,5811,323,8405,10507,311,1862,872,8349,13,2435,1101,20461,264,3831,8830,315,279,8712,11,1701,11156,3878,1093,330,69,86795,285,1821,409,38094,2428,1,323,330,77,22288,988,1,311,47032,872,3585,13,578,19114,596,33811,374,47999,11,439,814,3118,264,2867,12593,1990,11742,36214,12509,323,17808,6305,11,39686,279,7720,315,279,15629,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,220,20,704,315,220,20,374,430,279,8982,1436,8935,505,810,14509,828,477,13443,311,4726,55414,279,22032,6,6105,13,23212,11,1418,279,19114,1587,264,1695,2683,315,23387,872,10877,11,1063,5596,315,279,8982,2733,264,2766,85884,291,323,1436,387,13241,449,2731,66743,32847,13,28993,11,4869,11,279,19114,596,66343,2410,374,3831,11,323,358,4510,814,1053,13750,28008,1690,1274,315,279,7720,315,17808,36214,12509,13,128009],"total_duration":7218158783,"load_duration":162290,"prompt_eval_count":532,"prompt_eval_duration":1124386000,"eval_count":204,"eval_duration":6093102000}
