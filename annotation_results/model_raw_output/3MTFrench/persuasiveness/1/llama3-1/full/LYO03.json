The use of metaphors (\"cellule ville\"), analogies (\"centre commercial par Dieu\"), and storytelling techniques helps to make complex scientific concepts more accessible and memorable. Additionally, the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for their work are contagious, which adds to the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give a score of 5 because some parts of the speech may be perceived as slightly disconnected or unclear, especially for non-experts in biology. The speaker jumps between different ideas and concepts at times, which can make it difficult to follow the narrative. Nevertheless, overall, the speaker's persuasive abilities are strong, making this performance well-done and engaging.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,80905,514,38900,46838,556,18434,265,1317,67380,11,10071,54613,841,348,3023,14687,18434,265,92622,13,3489,301,1370,2172,8536,1826,3967,66,8047,1370,24150,17360,380,11,3900,264,220,3101,8261,1880,7930,9517,32423,86966,1133,326,6,1735,333,951,52571,1759,665,6160,38469,3930,17536,484,50753,13,46706,3846,96839,11,514,17536,484,50753,1826,76190,978,11,272,17771,4415,24918,1880,4864,36731,51625,53819,3846,57992,3869,9189,15471,38149,45889,8261,409,15907,3577,919,24511,13,1708,1105,4864,1446,2192,16968,409,16578,6502,409,1421,6672,5019,653,4046,747,8536,324,409,1317,118904,13109,13,11842,2536,13,11876,26419,514,40438,2727,2854,467,409,81337,1880,9071,519,409,60946,265,409,85722,7330,52760,272,17771,45575,781,331,45283,275,2428,13,1708,1105,3846,841,17317,40142,6502,4046,331,680,978,11,3625,16948,978,598,3567,1188,77554,14081,481,479,49806,261,8065,97739,9326,62891,294,31109,47838,479,8065,463,846,324,409,326,6,8671,70,48099,1880,409,1208,32118,8332,483,13,1708,1105,17536,484,556,5636,1317,67380,294,69537,541,10071,3869,26077,38847,13,29179,321,6496,326,6,2295,64,409,1208,38317,1180,31037,11,60946,265,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,1208,274,32453,24918,54401,409,841,6502,3567,404,5636,1317,67380,10071,76776,409,18434,265,64972,13,7695,47090,14707,60946,265,13,1252,11008,11,389,264,59148,1653,1744,514,17536,484,50753,308,96287,6502,3930,29121,1133,3869,29449,50026,40280,10071,934,35329,43989,1672,38096,7010,12155,2047,417,30371,4558,4978,13,44564,83187,1008,10610,1880,272,17771,3869,513,7631,261,3869,1208,51625,285,1744,503,55624,651,1188,11,6916,8047,409,7643,97045,1880,76776,409,824,3209,118904,14081,685,54401,409,60946,265,934,80720,342,48099,25692,14707,38682,8646,514,17536,484,50753,409,12155,2849,2482,1880,1208,51651,48659,272,17771,1744,503,34155,653,5803,266,358,6616,17,13,34447,272,17771,41091,9189,3327,72684,4538,436,57332,8065,19910,409,1208,2849,1130,13,7695,47090,14707,60946,265,1744,1208,2849,1130,1826,8065,88704,68,11,3846,1744,1208,39973,1826,3869,326,6,60159,17194,13,921,20234,76132,11,9964,308,77025,13080,665,34501,40280,11,6485,68,10071,77818,33537,978,13,29083,9952,41091,7010,1208,2849,1130,39973,1744,503,34155,14240,21178,978,8065,99568,3675,13,11876,31405,15132,15690,49733,11,3846,409,5634,20712,294,6,41540,811,294,31769,64374,13,27058,272,17771,28130,91678,978,51794,11,13085,89,514,12541,8518,1370,8574,84,11,653,274,93006,33670,409,326,41901,838,13,64105,64,379,1826,11,9189,62299,7010,7643,2849,1130,39973,11,25945,14707,74699,20605,10333,9952,41091,7010,7643,8235,635,8162,1355,2474,4864,9189,665,296,1441,7010,514,66167,409,1208,2849,1130,39973,11,54401,409,60946,265,4068,514,28800,17536,484,404,13,8242,15265,96721,11,9189,45366,22842,11,665,12704,84,11,326,58591,978,1018,11,27549,912,88,1339,8065,4502,73899,409,326,6,87713,324,9827,45,13,12471,519,409,40744,3625,35881,6948,8065,19910,409,1208,2849,1130,11,653,28800,5636,78060,11,1765,15265,7118,635,11,1208,9765,34395,43665,326,6,87713,11,27549,513,6900,409,1208,43998,4558,325,951,40321,14014,13,2998,3663,11,653,28800,409,78060,1765,1208,96721,11,9189,46524,10333,1208,2960,46140,71080,8065,4635,727,11,27549,513,6900,409,1208,43998,4558,325,409,326,31769,64374,13,18925,37093,89,8065,40970,653,46110,9888,1880,8065,41564,11,272,17771,409,62891,293,64272,3904,9952,6666,11,1208,9765,34395,43665,326,6,87713,1880,1208,2960,46140,71080,8065,4635,727,13,65381,326,55624,57663,409,27750,26633,293,64272,12843,11,46838,4202,8047,11,35719,513,6900,409,28130,34501,40280,13,19421,27750,6033,85,17740,35719,15132,81786,1880,6505,82,11,1522,306,294,22827,293,64272,3904,3869,326,49455,265,11,665,34501,951,9234,69898,409,1208,2849,1130,39973,13,356,17771,44351,1744,9189,308,26248,554,89,6502,1208,30179,768,294,31109,38920,60172,1765,1208,9765,34395,43665,326,6,87713,11,1880,20662,38920,60172,653,38900,11,27549,274,53149,6853,358,4334,49,17,1880,29557,1208,84143,951,6033,85,17740,35719,13,3206,39474,409,1296,294,68070,324,1543,18843,16549,68,11,10071,665,4046,28580,934,6,88423,514,27138,11,1208,296,14081,8047,9827,45,665,21559,1208,8246,409,5636,665,5636,409,27750,2700,35933,824,1072,288,11,3846,7930,264,5019,1615,20243,519,6316,80444,1880,3148,333,951,6033,85,17740,35719,11,409,1208,9765,34395,43665,326,6,87713,11,272,76832,513,16456,75217,8065,53052,409,1208,2960,46140,71080,8065,4635,727,13,48241,10610,519,11,653,293,3102,263,29
