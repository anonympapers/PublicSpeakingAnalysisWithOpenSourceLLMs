The use of real-life examples, such as Madame Martin's experiences, helps to illustrate the consequences of not having a unified system. The speaker also demonstrates a good understanding of international conventions, EU regulations, and human rights principles, which lends credibility to their proposal for a unified act of state civil status.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that the speech could be more effective if it included more concrete examples or data to support the argument. Additionally, some points may seem somewhat hypothetical or theoretical, which could undermine the persuasive power of the message. Nonetheless, overall, the speaker presents a compelling case for the need to harmonize state civil acts across Europe.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,34447,1744,20272,12,6853,409,19189,265,3869,28800,95199,268,949,14465,36731,16422,17194,1880,503,34155,9964,22011,3625,52314,8431,82,13,27058,9189,11,3900,841,274,6,74972,3738,1133,1744,409,4382,16287,13109,23541,13,2998,59157,13109,11,3625,52314,8431,82,11,272,17771,14707,5636,1744,39043,13,356,17771,326,6,49575,951,1180,288,7930,3613,68495,15265,17536,409,15265,4415,24918,55398,81991,15265,10237,13,3298,68,409,4415,24918,11,409,89360,11,409,35881,12416,11,272,17771,15265,48454,294,6,1748,13109,16422,307,2428,1765,1208,88265,15132,1672,38096,82,26725,3625,97222,1744,9189,47592,1645,9383,16968,8065,1317,409,15265,17536,13,33150,19910,409,326,6,33758,95199,26193,11,1880,5636,46680,969,1001,7010,514,38900,1218,1291,11,272,17771,64079,5019,841,6502,23761,11,841,15132,6502,42345,978,8637,81235,312,5259,355,294,22827,14240,266,653,47838,13,12095,9189,35881,579,89,409,30517,261,3625,4156,59307,11,5019,9189,44152,27584,27138,5019,4046,81,3212,7010,653,47838,21935,11,653,14240,266,3930,62321,409,829,5945,424,467,295,978,11,5019,653,2098,355,978,409,16456,3458,66014,653,1180,68,11,66021,934,35329,841,8024,6502,3869,829,83187,82291,13,2998,1794,2727,11,7010,3846,21935,11,26317,97222,78871,41518,355,13,41621,308,58736,1601,1339,5636,16422,307,81235,13,452,6,24677,402,52009,6824,68,3869,14240,664,1291,27750,96642,15082,1880,9071,10333,409,88817,9211,6316,3738,68,38793,951,83229,86709,409,64079,13,27058,51913,2058,11,653,13088,373,11826,11,12985,978,665,9822,11,1208,282,9011,1557,817,11,11083,91806,1439,11,409,409,43406,13088,373,3930,37194,11,41079,51084,665,1708,3516,24812,13,2998,37622,1744,16422,17194,11,503,34155,951,704,8839,3869,7643,46096,13,11876,45593,2655,367,3916,11,3625,83229,70,91555,95199,729,11,3625,18027,5512,11,3625,35881,6948,409,1208,6377,409,12437,409,326,6,33758,95199,26193,11,3625,94527,7546,288,409,1208,6377,95199,26193,11,951,97222,409,326,6,87713,13,8242,3625,447,37907,11,4864,296,53149,84,648,5019,27389,4120,3625,97222,3930,6681,2303,268,95199,268,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,10045,261,2192,27584,6316,6425,13509,1604,13,27058,62998,841,6502,75831,653,1180,68,5016,1765,514,43014,87264,1672,38096,11,665,14902,9952,3625,29124,83,1900,11,951,97222,21901,2908,12249,11,7930,841,92215,56316,23761,1323,285,665,5353,13,1252,1180,68,294,57286,266,8431,95199,268,13,34447,55455,308,17771,28068,978,11,1880,22299,653,4046,447,31059,265,17194,11,503,49152,685,665,88817,11943,514,77411,4046,447,31059,265,9465,294,22827,81337,11,3625,1218,32029,951,29124,83,1900,1880,409,326,49455,265,11,1208,22848,978,951,23496,355,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,32390,84,300,13071,1,323,13126,279,6105,10666,304,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,39686,279,12939,315,1614,8431,14385,323,872,18324,4028,7665,24743,13,578,1005,315,1972,26928,10507,11,1778,439,84276,11826,596,11704,11,8779,311,41468,279,16296,315,539,3515,264,43790,1887,13,578,19114,1101,32216,264,1695,8830,315,6625,45593,11,10013,14640,11,323,3823,3268,16565,11,902,79018,38769,311,872,14050,369,264,43790,1180,315,1614,8431,2704,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,220,20,704,315,220,20,374,430,279,8982,1436,387,810,7524,422,433,5343,810,14509,10507,477,828,311,1862,279,5811,13,23212,11,1063,3585,1253,2873,14738,59159,477,32887,11,902,1436,43047,279,66343,2410,315,279,1984,13,56733,11,8244,11,279,19114,18911,264,29722,1162,369,279,1205,311,18249,553,1614,8431,14385,4028,4606,13,128009],"total_duration":6895710094,"load_duration":158018,"prompt_eval_count":540,"prompt_eval_duration":1125922000,"eval_count":194,"eval_duration":5769091000}
