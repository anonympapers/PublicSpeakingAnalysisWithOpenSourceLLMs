{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T00:36:30.509149514Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would evaluate the speech as a 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasion and rigorous reasoning.\n\nThe speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using vivid imagery to describe the importance of social economy and the need for cooperation between countries. They effectively use rhetorical questions to engage the audience and encourage them to think about the future and the role of economic visioning.\n\nThe speech also demonstrates some flaws in the reasoning, such as the lack of concrete data or empirical evidence to support their claims. Additionally, there are some unclear or ambiguous statements that may be open to interpretation.\n\nHowever, overall, the speaker's passionate delivery and convincing argumentation make a strong case for the importance of social economy and cooperation, which earns them a score of 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasion and rigorous reasoning.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,356,17771,3625,23933,1154,47289,11206,285,11,28608,1880,259,9011,14295,7930,15132,2536,4698,5512,14848,409,25595,77660,13,11876,32116,7930,274,17771,25945,77558,25400,1880,934,85217,1448,300,275,3625,26467,42138,3625,46106,13,19421,74699,11,3625,82653,552,3674,82,11,3625,4046,12821,4065,409,326,31769,45317,648,3674,11,272,17771,25945,3062,13,11876,18003,75460,1880,1208,4349,24227,3674,82,82133,326,93825,25945,100198,13,11876,3678,41098,327,2700,2473,1208,19035,1765,326,31769,45317,648,3674,7010,514,4606,13,64105,64,76605,13510,1744,326,6,14386,10610,461,479,409,1901,541,2005,3900,308,17771,6502,7970,5019,3625,7591,652,1220,3674,82,13,11876,7591,652,1220,3674,82,308,17771,6502,48488,294,6,291,27476,978,5019,7591,68019,653,50026,40280,8518,37849,13,64105,64,76605,13510,1744,3900,308,17771,6502,3284,5019,46524,1208,19035,13,386,39614,7962,8536,2700,2473,1208,19035,409,326,31769,45317,648,3674,665,14240,664,1291,326,31769,49938,438,951,4046,67,978,652,1220,1880,46524,3625,4046,30780,93551,13,2998,86633,11,20662,4046,30780,93551,3073,306,13,14465,46524,2192,1208,19035,9465,3625,82653,552,3674,82,1880,3625,4046,12821,4065,13,19421,74699,11,87320,514,82653,648,3674,30,7695,379,264,3869,41091,43989,1879,978,665,14902,9465,326,52374,5523,648,1880,3625,9822,13,64105,64,76605,13510,409,1208,59251,409,26725,32592,1474,6736,7930,68905,3288,288,15878,50510,385,648,1765,951,65838,13,64105,64,76605,13510,28201,13,3489,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,30,7695,296,6,300,7304,1188,653,82653,648,7930,31435,11412,5019,4538,951,4046,25123,27748,1220,3674,82,7930,1826,1208,4790,52750,294,22827,220,1272,4,665,9517,23985,409,480,3023,13,46706,514,54206,37398,11,39043,76605,13510,653,82653,648,25945,3062,1826,75332,275,333,13,1708,1105,11,272,17771,326,93847,951,7634,7930,274,35329,379,264,326,31769,45317,648,75107,1826,25945,3062,1880,14848,42587,978,653,11163,30780,93551,13,356,17771,3869,17317,409,23423,261,3869,326,6,5389,404,1880,665,71751,653,11376,9517,41546,321,1291,409,7591,5586,514,82653,2428,13,19421,272,17771,6502,1131,356,96287,43650,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,15806,279,8982,439,264,220,19,704,315,220,20,304,3878,315,98224,323,47999,33811,627,198,791,19114,18911,872,5811,304,264,2867,323,64694,11827,11,1701,43120,41545,311,7664,279,12939,315,3674,8752,323,279,1205,369,23915,1990,5961,13,2435,13750,1005,87068,4860,311,16988,279,10877,323,15253,1124,311,1781,922,279,3938,323,279,3560,315,7100,11376,287,627,198,791,8982,1101,32216,1063,41859,304,279,33811,11,1778,439,279,6996,315,14509,828,477,46763,6029,311,1862,872,8349,13,23212,11,1070,527,1063,25420,477,55861,12518,430,1253,387,1825,311,23692,627,198,11458,11,8244,11,279,19114,596,25429,9889,323,40661,5811,367,1304,264,3831,1162,369,279,12939,315,3674,8752,323,23915,11,902,64859,1124,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,304,3878,315,98224,323,47999,33811,13,128009],"total_duration":5853316745,"load_duration":141256,"prompt_eval_count":426,"prompt_eval_duration":836828000,"eval_count":169,"eval_duration":5015873000}
