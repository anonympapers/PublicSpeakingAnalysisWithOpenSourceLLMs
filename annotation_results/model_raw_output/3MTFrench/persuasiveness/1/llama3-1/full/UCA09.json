{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T00:21:44.293862236Z","response":"Based on the dimension described in the DIMENSION section, which is \"In your opinion, how persuasive is the speech in this transcript, i.e., do the person effectively craft a convincing message? Is their reasoning rigorous?\" and considering the SCALE from 1=not at all to 5=very much, I would give the following score:\n\n**2**\n\nThe speech appears to be disorganized and lacks a clear message or persuasive strategy. The speaker seems unsure of themselves, repeating phrases such as \"I don't know what to do\" and \"I think that...\". The reasoning is not rigorous, and the arguments presented are not convincing. Additionally, the inclusion of nonsensical phrases like \"nakemakel\" and the seemingly random use of Japanese words (\"ため lawa\", \"Aspa no no\") makes it difficult to understand or take seriously. Overall, I would rate this speech as 2 out of 5 in terms of its persuasiveness.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,103846,2383,64,11,2383,64,11,2383,64,11,21143,1666,6733,912,912,11,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,1102,596,4228,369,757,311,656,433,11,719,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,13,3277,358,2019,430,11,1606,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,11,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,9393,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,13,9393,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,9393,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,2030,358,1781,430,422,358,656,433,11,433,1053,15187,4287,856,9021,13,5112,358,3619,1268,2574,690,387,2884,13,358,1781,358,1541,956,617,264,3254,893,430,1102,596,682,358,1205,311,656,13,3277,499,8521,757,11,499,3463,430,358,4265,4018,433,304,1403,9863,13,499,3463,430,358,4265,4018,1578,264,6710,13,2100,358,1436,5622,499,449,264,22145,13,264,6710,315,43459,2403,856,18301,323,856,8071,13,362,1474,587,301,11,56270,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,42065,8886,11450,13,6914,279,5015,584,11,358,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,7633,304,279,51959,24557,3857,11,902,374,330,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,7673,323,13126,279,79223,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,11,358,1053,3041,279,2768,5573,1473,9,9,17,334,198,198,791,8982,8111,311,387,834,63316,323,37856,264,2867,1984,477,66343,8446,13,578,19114,5084,44003,315,5694,11,40916,32847,1778,439,330,40,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,1,323,330,40,1781,430,1131,3343,578,33811,374,539,47999,11,323,279,6105,10666,527,539,40661,13,23212,11,279,28286,315,32795,729,950,32847,1093,330,43974,336,587,301,1,323,279,23490,4288,1005,315,11002,4339,3573,103846,2383,64,498,330,2170,6733,912,912,909,3727,433,5107,311,3619,477,1935,14243,13,28993,11,358,1053,4478,420,8982,439,220,17,704,315,220,20,304,3878,315,1202,24613,300,13071,13,128009],"total_duration":7115818567,"load_duration":158070,"prompt_eval_count":636,"prompt_eval_duration":1226783000,"eval_count":196,"eval_duration":5888375000}
