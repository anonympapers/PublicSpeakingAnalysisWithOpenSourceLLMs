{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T00:40:31.120684262Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I evaluate that the speech is very persuasive (5/5) in terms of crafting a convincing message and rigorous reasoning. The speaker presents a clear and compelling argument about the value of lignin and its potential to replace plastic materials. They use vivid language and imaginative scenarios to convey their ideas, making them engaging and memorable. Additionally, they provide specific examples and details about their work on developing biodegradable composites, which adds credibility to their claims.\n\nThe speaker's tone is also noteworthy - they are passionate, enthusiastic, and seemingly genuine in their pursuit of a more sustainable future. Their use of metaphors (e.g., \"déchets plus déchets, ça match\") and poetic language (\"un brin de romantisme aussi\") adds a touch of creativity and charm to the presentation.\n\nOverall, I believe that this speech is highly persuasive and effective in conveying its message, earning a score of 5/5.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,26248,547,3625,7591,331,1441,13,41621,26483,19610,829,33288,665,27584,27138,13,57702,1208,10484,13109,1343,5169,13703,817,409,7591,331,1441,934,54386,264,934,31109,296,1130,1765,20662,3197,66522,11,64972,4499,5512,264,3212,1744,3625,7591,1985,5512,13,1708,1105,11,4502,389,864,77,1339,779,258,409,12155,7591,331,1441,11,259,21198,5019,2558,556,3930,26365,1291,11,389,69152,3930,66304,11,272,17771,14707,4635,84,13,46706,8941,11741,1339,11,1208,2849,1130,305,3538,13,34447,11,389,78422,12339,28463,8065,21765,220,1041,11990,409,52021,1370,459,11,409,1647,7591,331,1441,27389,69,68862,13,5034,72700,483,11,26633,90272,75164,3682,60224,3930,66304,13,1952,841,829,275,6502,75249,20028,45575,389,326,26248,1437,30872,273,5019,2558,556,409,326,31769,64374,13,435,2957,1826,54312,409,21273,258,30,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,46838,404,569,64656,33254,424,1208,72700,483,951,1344,8836,288,13,14465,52571,42463,1744,72353,668,264,14448,69068,3846,7591,331,1441,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,4864,56445,46939,1370,8464,6316,5017,978,3869,1208,72700,483,13,14465,25400,21559,951,463,339,978,1572,5019,1208,9517,533,1553,8065,53052,409,27750,19670,288,294,6,61263,70,48099,13,46408,312,59976,3930,97418,951,1376,288,11,97507,11,39043,296,26248,16603,3625,1400,31539,49806,288,13,9240,68,829,16458,554,8841,1640,2428,13,432,5512,495,266,409,829,19266,36235,369,51084,9952,1208,2849,1130,305,3538,13,27058,1208,65827,268,404,11,4864,25400,30179,6960,653,47838,7591,331,1441,13,386,5014,12,466,417,436,2642,645,409,7643,38672,82,11,514,72006,12,39754,74801,438,13,34447,4502,9189,23933,10333,3846,7591,331,1441,11,934,54386,25692,46131,490,32453,7010,1208,11277,409,1208,4671,8511,13,27058,28130,10607,11,4864,9517,1072,285,757,1765,665,281,3023,265,13,32429,4502,9964,274,6,300,993,13559,22299,39043,46206,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,11,272,3433,978,41091,11,7591,331,1441,5636,7591,331,1441,11,39043,2489,13,51097,26633,463,339,978,11932,75460,15132,19227,1001,37608,36527,7930,514,1913,79738,1370,71751,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,13,39783,80444,409,88247,2428,5790,10676,978,11,6160,536,78130,11,63828,1414,665,36292,1880,90551,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,8162,1474,978,376,2428,11,4864,326,6,49133,7010,3625,4647,485,417,951,9986,645,13,14465,514,490,33462,554,11,4864,326,6,44803,325,11,4864,75765,829,31807,4011,32118,4919,2428,13,1252,2816,25692,23761,1744,2486,467,11,5019,3869,312,10398,15170,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,7010,3625,757,392,645,409,12155,31547,1572,11,1208,348,87960,3869,1208,81645,11,1208,1080,593,409,12155,43116,17144,11,1370,1647,42775,1880,665,14448,285,519,1880,4046,67,5615,9211,22299,1208,4671,483,11,503,6,391,45808,6316,6425,27220,8065,1323,16491,951,88247,8467,2425,355,3930,281,10515,5898,13,19421,97507,11,9189,23933,10333,11,9952,653,1437,258,409,68567,44618,28463,11,389,25692,20028,1860,11967,514,38900,13,4418,66,97507,11,46152,15132,19227,1001,37608,36527,7930,33537,306,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,8162,1474,978,376,2428,11,503,6,49133,3625,78352,409,326,6,867,75,1082,11,389,523,2428,13,2009,9517,79,10515,306,11,389,2109,1339,326,6,90446,13,19421,4160,321,6496,11,39587,503,34155,5906,409,17571,951,297,398,325,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,15806,430,279,8982,374,1633,66343,320,20,14,20,8,304,3878,315,45167,264,40661,1984,323,47999,33811,13,578,19114,18911,264,2867,323,29722,5811,922,279,907,315,72700,258,323,1202,4754,311,8454,12466,7384,13,2435,1005,43120,4221,323,77361,26350,311,20599,872,6848,11,3339,1124,23387,323,33596,13,23212,11,814,3493,3230,10507,323,3649,922,872,990,389,11469,6160,536,78130,470,81239,11,902,11621,38769,311,872,8349,627,198,791,19114,596,16630,374,1101,67479,482,814,527,25429,11,42702,11,323,23490,22785,304,872,33436,315,264,810,22556,3938,13,11205,1005,315,31768,1105,320,68,13,70,2637,330,67,978,331,1441,5636,7591,331,1441,11,39043,2489,909,323,76534,4221,3573,359,1437,258,409,68567,44618,28463,909,11621,264,5916,315,28697,323,32353,311,279,15864,627,198,28589,11,358,4510,430,420,8982,374,7701,66343,323,7524,304,94165,1202,1984,11,28744,264,5573,315,220,20,14,20,13,128009],"total_duration":7162799164,"load_duration":154003,"prompt_eval_count":687,"prompt_eval_duration":1349889000,"eval_count":193,"eval_duration":5812209000}
