{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T00:40:58.318471621Z","response":"Based on the dimension \"In your opinion, how persuasive is the speech in this transcript, i.e., do the person effectively craft a convincing message? Is their reasoning rigorous?\" I would give a score of 3 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker uses some effective rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"Tu n'as pas sa main\" repeated several times) and storytelling to engage the audience. However, the speech is not particularly well-structured or cohesive, with abrupt shifts in topic and unclear connections between ideas. Additionally, some of the language used is overly complex or vague (e.g. \"La c√©rotonine, hormone du bonheur\"), which can make it difficult for listeners to follow the speaker's arguments.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in terms of engaging their audience and presenting their ideas, they could benefit from refining their delivery and presentation skills to make their message more convincing and easy to understand.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,29749,308,6,300,6502,829,1925,11,350,6,300,91329,4852,409,46131,11,65479,89,2442,81991,9964,296,57286,29246,308,6,300,6502,829,1925,328,44886,26248,281,956,6,6583,25108,668,11,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,9964,308,6,300,6502,829,1925,42759,17317,11,7930,11,294,6,40997,9189,11,264,13088,494,648,20662,72709,41621,11,9189,11,259,77025,44093,49733,11,9189,13085,89,4502,665,5636,41621,47592,3625,44315,8065,53052,3930,35641,61651,97507,11,39015,1773,291,388,11,15878,11,389,61158,301,1339,69327,2852,11,503,6,26577,648,62408,84411,536,409,18475,4571,72,1640,2428,393,12339,379,1295,409,38317,3608,60224,62293,6316,1765,6387,316,367,11876,38546,6007,11,294,6,8904,1759,11,409,22234,1880,409,9517,325,12249,12288,83391,24971,26317,9622,46138,11,10071,97507,11,9189,62299,1522,5512,1370,1208,14707,33670,9189,41621,47592,409,1208,6140,11,294,6,52009,1759,11,3846,57992,11,14465,91507,9189,3327,72684,87320,80905,272,76832,83786,25108,818,1208,87067,409,1208,32118,5641,263,483,11,5034,33651,817,36908,3930,72709,3489,438,272,17771,934,54386,513,11,4275,4864,514,30209,68,11,41091,1880,41091,14707,33150,312,35573,665,7591,566,5048,11,11876,51516,3930,11837,306,3675,41518,306,3930,220,17,76145,409,28130,61510,1604,18024,2727,321,9465,220,777,1135,1880,220,679,21,19421,5019,61512,11,514,72709,77049,11,514,21901,44186,27058,514,9517,43014,514,2098,355,2428,1880,8841,2428,7695,28130,29557,294,49152,13603,6316,94721,5178,94400,2428,1880,25702,1611,7706,12329,3625,47371,4377,1880,5089,17724,19421,64972,35597,11,409,14707,6155,9769,1565,15878,97418,11876,88817,8696,7330,333,8467,84867,1414,1744,1208,20893,11,1880,14707,54008,67882,11876,1760,978,1074,89,3625,1089,3422,264,1083,288,1880,934,85217,31435,56311,6791,20099,12155,58214,19421,17317,52962,3808,11,45575,11,5019,24166,514,72709,2009,8577,311,69,2194,11,1208,58347,951,1089,3422,264,1083,288,14465,514,436,57332,409,27389,2407,325,1759,1611,76076,17317,312,1485,76,17060,4558,2392,7010,514,272,5976,2933,5034,272,56771,783,483,11,36908,3930,7970,383,324,19421,274,55624,10515,12329,3869,31632,409,3846,8577,311,69,2194,19421,27549,296,26248,978,376,685,409,1323,295,665,32118,5641,263,483,42215,28130,20605,68,3930,1794,2727,321,2009,8577,311,69,2194,1826,653,1089,307,20588,4043,306,13327,356,8458,76605,13510,934,35329,1826,18525,91640,1469,403,978,4366,1208,20893,2582,11,6502,653,1179,68,934,80720,1760,978,483,7011,978,11,39043,87264,409,934,81130,3625,296,412,2439,5019,12155,523,388,3869,409,326,6,434,306,8065,893,593,409,1794,2727,321,2998,9071,519,409,46524,326,6,391,265,332,978,483,13171,294,6,395,7889,514,21765,3930,8577,311,69,2194,1611,326,55624,478,258,5553,514,29340,19421,3930,29340,2167,1133,5553,514,272,5976,2933,356,8458,22011,11,514,272,5976,2933,841,17317,58424,635,6502,1208,259,9011,1557,3489,438,3900,11412,26725,11,272,17771,653,33241,20588,19421,951,3678,447,5512,7010,514,29340,19421,28130,2815,84,264,6502,6502,6502,6502,14549,435,1339,288,326,52152,593,41621,12584,89,5790,95920,3869,7364,409,436,57332,24703,7930,8654,5615,331,2473,29449,6917,30893,60224,11,69003,978,7010,514,272,5976,2933,34447,272,17771,326,6,351,73,2194,294,6,1138,1553,27058,14240,664,1291,3625,4787,4571,72,1640,8467,1880,26677,36527,8171,481,409,4799,12329,514,21765,3930,8577,311,69,2194,7010,514,272,5976,2933,27058,1744,12155,523,388,3869,409,326,6,434,306,98632,68,64972,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,7673,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,18,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,5829,1063,7524,87068,7766,1778,439,54515,3573,54071,308,6,300,6502,829,1925,1,11763,3892,3115,8,323,48929,311,16988,279,10877,13,4452,11,279,8982,374,539,8104,1664,12,52243,477,87516,11,449,44077,29735,304,8712,323,25420,13537,1990,6848,13,23212,11,1063,315,279,4221,1511,374,39532,6485,477,40146,320,68,13,70,13,330,8921,272,56771,783,483,11,36908,3930,7970,383,324,4063,902,649,1304,433,5107,369,24475,311,1833,279,19114,596,6105,627,198,28589,11,1418,279,19114,5039,1063,11471,304,3878,315,23387,872,10877,323,32644,872,6848,11,814,1436,8935,505,74285,872,9889,323,15864,7512,311,1304,872,1984,810,40661,323,4228,311,3619,13,128009],"total_duration":6950207601,"load_duration":252410,"prompt_eval_count":704,"prompt_eval_duration":
