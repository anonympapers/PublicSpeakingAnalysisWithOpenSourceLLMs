The use of storytelling techniques, such as describing the \"palais des glaces\" and the process of finding the optimal arrangement of materials, makes the topic more accessible and interesting to the audience. The speaker's enthusiasm and passion for their research are also contagious, making it harder not to be persuaded by their argument.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give a score of 5 is that the speech could benefit from a clearer structure and more precise explanations at times. Additionally, some parts of the speech may not resonate with all listeners, as the speaker assumes some prior knowledge of mathematical concepts and uses technical terms like \"optimisation topologique\" without fully explaining them. However, overall, the speaker's persuasive abilities are quite strong, and they effectively convey their message to the audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,6178,72,11,4864,66517,409,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,5019,46524,326,6,351,967,1133,7706,1604,409,5634,20712,7010,653,1488,10367,7010,514,719,409,7591,34535,978,409,326,93847,13,1219,2727,39043,11,39043,264,326,6,1334,4684,76366,11,10071,4864,94297,9189,326,6,30992,72684,13,41621,23933,10333,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,11,272,17771,20662,33464,934,54386,4160,275,71151,7010,3625,2267,1220,409,369,49530,13,2009,719,11,46524,1208,84143,5019,45602,11,3900,47090,30517,261,3869,1208,14707,20486,11,4846,1370,653,40126,409,5405,3416,18300,68,13,19421,46680,969,1001,11,22299,389,11412,51913,2058,409,513,74282,66014,1880,409,513,38831,15170,9952,6316,13697,1765,514,4156,11,389,69152,15907,69236,1880,665,259,24444,818,13,7777,11,49733,3900,379,264,6316,5405,3416,11,4864,296,6,1138,37093,13,7777,11,49733,272,17771,23895,11,4864,94297,1860,11967,13,2998,5589,11,9189,23933,10333,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,13,2998,463,1824,22550,11,8065,3729,951,1370,30148,11,1880,389,3900,93569,951,35483,409,656,343,2641,1765,3625,13458,417,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,653,33632,519,7930,14848,100162,9952,3625,69236,1355,278,11,5019,84440,1474,5615,9004,513,38831,15170,3869,3460,404,9952,3625,69236,10039,9620,13,362,5457,409,259,24444,40280,11,43029,39043,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,326,6,329,3460,404,13,11876,4371,15760,1759,1765,27750,69236,513,15132,5155,14014,1765,1208,7479,951,2840,2492,13,19421,4502,389,274,58591,817,3869,834,20672,326,6,49575,951,2840,2492,5019,1744,46777,54613,7930,9465,30570,593,6316,3738,68,85722,1880,594,7003,306,3625,69236,10039,9620,13,19421,14707,39043,11,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,34447,5019,41091,11,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,11,272,17771,6316,80444,409,712,635,7010,1208,88265,3846,841,15132,6502,3625,48577,7930,4319,29580,13,34447,409,326,93847,11,1880,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,3846,841,15132,6502,951,5405,3416,1744,326,54386,2035,11,10071,951,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,13,3489,438,326,6,14310,852,11,514,3729,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,11,3625,10062,2439,82133,274,59858,15938,655,13,80905,22299,3625,35483,409,656,343,2641,1880,3869,1208,84143,11,326,94572,84010,61799,40970,409,10062,13,43987,26178,11,4068,389,945,768,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,949,33150,706,569,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6316,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6502,11,1880,49733,503,41901,296,1441,26633,5019,5019,9598,274,31769,85,1188,1744,2536,13,7695,841,17317,47090,6316,94721,98652,13,356,17771,3846,1765,75249,4864,42775,273,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,62408,98652,11,272,17771,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,13,7695,274,6,74972,409,834,20672,3625,86374,4298,2249,5019,93381,71933,951,1665,22589,7930,15132,48416,8977,1208,20545,951,10062,2439,7010,326,93847,1880,75144,514,40970,409,86374,4298,2249,3284,13,80905,294,41901,864,52985,665,42463,11,3625,6155,1673,288,7930,274,98279,2252,306,3869,41091,11,22299,1208,85722,15890,326,6,14310,852,1826,96488,3625,10062,2439,13,27058,46524,1208,94721,46096,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,503,49963,1082,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,13,12535,949,14465,296,1441,294,6,370,541,3625,1665,22589,1880,3625,6155,1673,288,32592,1208,57128,294,31769,1030,1056,554,13,2998,51092,11,503,34155,35881,13649,288,326,55624,57663,409,7643,712,25108,668,665,51854,86696,27378,13,19421,503,55624,4653,285,7010,11083,91329,2168,2436,11,272,17771,934,54386,917,6853,6316,3977,409,43656,13,2998,5589,11,503,55624,978,911,261,2192,514,16968,7010,653,2082,409,5935,13,356,17771,3846,2082,7930,29557,1765,1208,51304,409,1208,3977,409,43656,409,29960,8047,6033,2536,11,653,5634,28154,2933,51791,519,7010,46777,46110,8286,409,1208,712,25108,668,13,362,32384,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,52895,375,6316,98652,7930,682,648,1208,64441,1880,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,653,9880,9189,19477,52750,653,51791,519,94773,7706,69068,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,32390,84,27645,1,323,279,5569,505,220,16,320,1962,520,682,8,311,220,20,320,1225,1790,705,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,3146,19,334,13,198,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,26073,6485,19476,304,459,23387,1648,11,1701,1375,15436,24291,552,323,31768,1105,13,578,1005,315,48929,12823,11,1778,439,23524,279,330,19866,2852,951,2840,2492,1,323,279,1920,315,9455,279,23669,27204,315,7384,11,3727,279,8712,810,15987,323,7185,311,279,10877,13,578,19114,596,3
