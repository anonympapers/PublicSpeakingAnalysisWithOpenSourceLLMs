The speaker shares their own experiences and losses, which makes the issue more relatable and urgent. The use of vivid imagery and metaphors (e.g., \"regardez votre voisin\") also helps to engage the audience and make the problem seem more tangible.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker presents a clear and concise explanation of the issue with livermektine and its implications for the environment, which demonstrates their expertise and authority on the topic. The goal of understanding how livermektine works on parasites is well-defined, and the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for finding a solution are contagious.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give it a perfect score (5) because the speech could benefit from more structure and organization. The transitions between ideas and paragraphs are not always smooth, which can make it harder to follow the train of thought. Additionally, some parts of the speech feel like they're tangential or repetitive, which might detract from the overall persuasiveness.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,4241,9425,1208,85434,294,57286,408,11,3900,29253,6316,1709,67100,513,9537,7930,264,46939,20272,951,11990,409,10237,82,13,622,34155,41091,98375,824,1072,76076,83491,2439,1880,15878,294,2182,1744,9189,28463,11,4864,73953,81186,10253,60120,17258,10145,7930,348,10126,1188,7010,1208,18728,2727,3869,81337,409,46206,11083,6699,11,42676,503,31769,2629,285,5636,36963,1880,7930,308,26248,8811,75876,43765,6502,7550,20243,84,13,46706,20662,1709,67100,11,17317,57038,653,52827,34561,11,17317,11,3625,2854,1771,11,10071,44767,3625,4039,12249,7930,779,1188,2024,4014,417,6033,3678,1354,9952,3625,27080,288,11,3625,297,1082,12249,1880,27584,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,13,62408,61624,336,285,34561,11,272,17771,514,5309,1370,11697,635,13,11876,5309,1370,11697,635,15132,961,412,1880,15132,409,43905,62827,13,15663,1771,15132,8162,2445,454,8467,1880,18434,306,7010,514,2092,1880,45602,15132,25945,14707,5019,326,41901,2842,40280,13,2998,5891,29097,11,294,81979,15132,25945,32118,99906,1880,1370,11697,635,934,300,3904,40744,3625,16948,4558,1634,18434,15844,1765,20662,3197,66522,13,921,978,445,316,1395,11,6316,54613,1765,26633,1826,4225,478,8047,6033,264,24560,4225,478,8047,13,4418,66,11,1239,42441,89,15265,4160,58504,11,15265,96721,11,1239,42441,89,15265,4160,58504,11,15265,7118,635,13,12095,272,17771,6502,9189,11,272,17771,15265,4160,58504,7930,1826,4225,478,8047,13,14465,841,94297,6502,296,6,14310,3550,409,26725,3625,79383,7930,3073,306,1765,20662,88026,13,4418,66,11,503,34155,6316,17576,8047,1765,66090,3930,523,4023,265,7930,296,26248,9781,372,3689,978,7010,1647,33632,685,13,4418,66,11,3846,5309,46206,921,4023,265,11,389,9781,25108,818,951,35665,33515,4428,3946,1880,21552,22589,1880,25692,83786,25108,1215,1208,10237,409,326,6,48999,13,1952,264,42676,27584,6316,802,2727,45973,3846,5309,11,6316,22337,273,1826,4635,84,7930,274,53149,6853,22617,76,17588,483,13,22617,76,17588,483,43989,8518,285,8047,7010,3625,65838,220,1490,11,39587,3900,379,264,220,1272,8261,13,19421,272,17771,39015,39723,27549,80259,13,356,17771,1744,41199,22299,5019,3625,3276,24911,8467,1880,3625,293,533,28154,5512,11,3625,5309,14848,68866,978,951,31807,380,3095,3869,20662,22337,273,4046,56745,13,19421,272,17771,39015,39723,503,6,24677,526,361,13,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,60946,265,4068,326,6,1553,76,17588,483,34501,818,1765,3846,28417,285,11,66021,934,54386,514,829,275,44093,6502,3869,326,6,75876,1180,31037,11,10071,42138,220,1272,8261,13,19421,409,60946,265,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,31807,4011,11866,5118,14014,11,9189,42463,20662,22337,273,4046,56745,5019,52895,716,409,80080,44397,19395,552,63922,2392,13,4418,66,389,264,42676,27584,45889,24817,288,11,389,829,275,1744,326,6,1553,76,17588,483,264,342,285,1765,514,72601,32015,2249,3930,28417,285,13,4418,66,4538,272,5976,2933,1826,5636,51625,285,42625,1765,951,9517,1512,38647,13,1708,1105,27750,9517,1512,38647,15132,40321,5512,409,272,6009,32592,6316,887,8047,11,22299,272,6009,656,343,2641,13,19421,29557,10367,514,21765,6033,6502,7010,653,1984,32015,2249,11,46932,519,1744,514,9517,1512,12844,32592,12,48764,6033,513,18728,2727,13,4418,66,514,2807,265,1370,706,635,264,653,887,8047,22299,30870,1414,11,296,4091,11,513,14843,556,11,326,27688,8047,39904,3869,30517,829,35429,12844,1880,83786,25108,818,1957,11,39587,296,4091,11,30870,1414,11,513,14843,556,13,22617,76,17588,483,11,27549,11,11412,513,5155,261,1765,829,9517,1512,12844,1880,8654,5615,9211,514,2807,265,11,1028,59157,12329,40744,27750,6299,13,4418,66,514,2807,265,1826,1370,5893,53070,1880,11412,67683,404,13,34447,4502,514,2807,265,1826,31807,11451,11,326,6,1553,76,17588,483,841,5019,969,56316,5155,261,1765,514,9517,1512,12844,1880,3930,16081,514,2807,265,11412,15471,38149,48647,479,7010,514,523,2933,301,13,4418,66,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,46939,3608,90859,11,272,17771,9517,1512,12844,11,1880,409,46524,1208,51651,18528,665,32592,61675,978,5019,1744,39043,11412,274,6,370,668,324,1765,34501,8301,13,19421,3930,16081,14240,664,1291,3625,22639,409,3846,9517,1512,12844,11,9952,326,6,1553,76,17588,483,11,1208,22337,273,4046,3395,2428,11,1826,11866,76366,11,7930,1826,42587,978,5019,18027,261,3846,85573,13,46706,653,26633,90272,27138,11,503,34155,296,55624,978,676,978,10253,34684,409,31807,4011,7930,264,1765,3846,9517,1512,12844,5019,52895,716,6316,48659,44397,19395,648,1880,687,263,1215,1208,31807,4011,13,4
