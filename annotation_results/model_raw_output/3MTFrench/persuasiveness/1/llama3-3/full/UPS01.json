{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T09:55:36.297334987Z","response":"Based on the dimension \"In your opinion, how persuasive is the speech in this transcript, i.e., do the person effectively craft a convincing message? Is their reasoning rigorous?\" I would give a score of 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker presents a clear and compelling argument about the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the transportation sector. They provide specific examples and data to support their claims, such as the increase in emissions over the past few years, and the need for a neutral carbon balance by 2050. The speaker also highlights the paradox that while there has been some progress made in reducing emissions, there is still much work to be done.\n\nThe reasoning is generally rigorous, with the speaker providing evidence-based arguments and highlighting the importance of combining multiple factors (such as transportation mode, vehicle efficiency, and energy source) to achieve their goal. The only area where the reasoning could be improved is in the speaker's reliance on vague phrases such as \"il y a notamment\" and \"en changeant d'énergie pour passer du pétrole à la mobilité électrique, hydrogène ou obiogase\", which do not provide specific details or data to support their claims.\n\nOverall, I believe that the speaker effectively crafts a convincing message, providing a clear and compelling argument for why reducing greenhouse gas emissions is important, and how it can be achieved.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,15132,908,5512,5636,6033,40970,2167,1133,3869,29449,7591,3825,685,1200,10515,5898,7010,3625,69169,7930,17317,17634,11981,77,14081,4893,3869,6316,305,3538,4046,652,285,3930,281,10515,5898,1880,15890,3625,4046,5287,5536,306,29449,77323,1880,1208,28062,3748,978,3930,11323,266,13,65381,5457,409,326,6,1617,6960,11,514,13826,1001,11323,266,2428,308,17771,5636,934,22827,4382,80259,50026,40280,278,13,356,17771,653,7591,10188,82653,2428,3674,5019,1208,7251,953,1880,1208,77463,38450,12267,1880,1208,7550,648,294,31109,25626,48901,409,326,6,26380,13109,13,1708,1105,934,35329,2267,664,14687,4671,2058,514,9517,5697,1739,479,26633,409,911,5512,5019,51913,2058,3625,281,3946,1615,978,45045,17317,1488,546,16968,64079,5553,3625,56321,409,911,5512,13,65381,3044,1744,3625,14240,1900,5201,306,43153,79971,13,34447,9189,757,13510,89,6293,978,72,409,1208,34922,409,12366,11,294,31109,11148,566,978,12267,1880,294,31109,18824,409,1208,88026,11,17317,11,389,1826,51173,12267,13,19421,14707,11,20272,288,6502,60019,13,46706,29449,31237,12844,514,5636,4046,4150,668,324,11,3625,69169,11,3625,4046,5287,27584,49806,306,1880,27750,56321,36852,59307,65838,13,34447,7010,514,27584,27138,11,389,264,79415,978,326,6,3042,684,13,1952,348,1082,46838,494,2852,1208,21277,13109,1841,20337,3869,220,508,1135,11,3846,7930,11866,2428,220,15,4046,5287,7010,3625,69169,13,80905,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,60946,265,4068,93381,396,409,20662,1665,333,13,27058,45602,11,503,6,44803,325,326,31769,65272,81621,951,4046,5287,1880,4068,27549,92215,369,79507,48416,8977,3869,326,6,5389,404,11,665,14240,41939,3625,1156,10610,10308,409,33547,294,6,3457,220,508,1135,13,27058,8678,805,326,31769,65272,951,4046,5287,11,4864,59157,1082,6316,7591,77907,665,220,20,2267,80,668,1759,3327,5118,266,22589,11,7930,15132,220,20,23464,4918,1765,3625,447,37907,389,25692,945,404,5019,98004,805,3625,4046,5287,13,7695,379,264,81186,1208,64382,409,326,6,48029,11178,7710,11,514,39474,5553,951,20362,40970,4046,4150,668,1759,22299,514,5542,1880,514,45165,385,11,514,49348,69241,1056,425,951,45165,83613,2482,11,81186,4669,514,1080,12,1617,324,425,11,6316,94721,31914,582,13109,4046,39624,99188,665,82620,951,45165,83613,2482,48488,5636,73083,5512,1880,5636,1207,665,4046,64374,13,19421,665,5589,11,665,2349,519,294,31769,64374,5019,45347,3930,281,10515,5898,3869,1208,12881,3748,978,98151,34395,11,17055,70,48099,6033,1536,72,540,521,13,11583,7809,57288,9465,514,81621,1880,514,18111,324,20605,265,653,6800,52313,13,1708,1105,1744,1370,514,81621,11,272,17771,1208,62163,409,7710,7930,264,514,5636,3327,76366,326,31769,65272,951,4046,5287,11,3846,23464,1291,20272,25945,28800,326,6,67816,409,79036,6814,37526,3869,326,6,2943,13,33150,32150,556,11,514,2609,1133,294,31769,64374,308,26248,15925,1744,25945,28800,294,6,6581,295,1370,514,81621,13,34447,272,17771,76776,39015,409,46932,265,3869,326,6,5389,404,11,22299,514,20272,1208,44397,19395,648,85182,40280,1604,11,97487,39587,653,41958,25945,10025,64591,13,2998,59157,13109,11,3900,11412,26564,385,404,3698,10670,3625,220,20,23464,4918,5019,93381,71933,220,15,4046,5287,294,6,3457,71686,220,2148,8261,13,5186,12416,11,389,21889,16968,514,38900,1826,294,69537,541,1765,326,6,1735,333,11,272,17771,3625,52138,729,3869,7930,17477,3488,13,1219,2727,4502,326,54386,348,11206,1339,26725,514,2609,1133,11,272,17771,60019,1744,3625,79165,841,2609,306,13,2009,719,409,1647,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,39587,28463,326,6,16288,934,6,37907,15132,3625,3541,1354,11,10071,28463,3625,23464,4918,1880,3625,272,15784,483,544,285,3869,20662,9320,13,39783,82653,648,409,22267,99481,5636,2092,60224,11,3625,4046,20609,288,84233,69,1238,3288,14014,3930,45165,385,6033,35597,3625,4647,485,417,1421,283,1725,409,45165,83613,2482,5636,11427,306,665,594,40751,13,435,2259,1001,11,20662,4046,20609,68,7591,10188,87264,28463,6316,4905,3928,978,5019,9686,12,23156,13,1708,1105,11,389,274,59858,2322,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,7673,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,18911,264,2867,323,29722,5811,922,279,12939,315,18189,37647,6962,20748,11,8104,304,279,18386,10706,13,2435,3493,3230,10507,323,828,311,1862,872,8349,11,1778,439,279,5376,304,20748,927,279,3347,2478,16
