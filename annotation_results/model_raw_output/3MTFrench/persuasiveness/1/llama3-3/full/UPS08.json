Is their reasoning rigorous?\" I would give a score of 4.\n\nThe speaker's use of personal anecdotes and examples helps to establish a connection with the audience. The explanation of complex terms like \"quantit√© de sensation\" and \"notes dans un certain Nord\" is engaging and easy to follow. The speaker also shows enthusiasm and passion for their topic, which makes it more convincing. However, there are some parts that feel less persuasive, such as the repetition of phrases like \"c'est bon\" or \"ca leur en mieux.\" Additionally, some points made by the speaker may be subjective or unclear, which might affect the overall persuasiveness.\n\nOverall, I think the speaker effectively crafts a convincing message and presents their reasoning in a rigorous manner.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,3206,523,295,519,5019,5891,404,6033,13458,8941,5019,296,4091,13,356,17771,6316,3488,1744,4864,757,36731,71151,1153,8047,11,1880,4864,841,63762,6502,9189,11,10071,41091,1206,12267,479,11,4864,2145,5019,296,4091,13,16062,16081,11,272,17771,665,67781,1647,36252,1291,11,4864,60534,13,34447,6666,11,4864,841,60534,6502,308,6,94896,75249,13,14465,60534,951,1589,66474,951,1446,417,72476,1900,13,19421,22299,4864,36731,342,414,1969,11,503,26248,547,379,92528,2743,951,4411,346,12249,409,3273,404,3869,326,55624,57663,13,19421,409,1208,523,5048,12303,3869,1208,5355,4618,1765,514,21273,355,13,19421,1370,86633,27584,951,912,285,47003,31070,1291,13,356,17771,7970,11,9189,47592,1913,13,6178,72,28463,13,34447,7970,11,4864,9189,1860,818,11,9189,12584,89,757,13510,11,42287,11,272,17771,5636,60019,6316,1589,25253,951,1446,417,8065,72476,266,13,356,17771,409,1055,84,21965,6485,68,13,7695,379,264,21965,294,6,287,81,15433,4167,13,10619,13,14465,9189,1208,1867,451,13,1952,1826,5636,1765,3930,908,978,7802,648,13,19421,97507,11,9189,47592,73173,11,653,908,978,7802,648,3869,4972,72,11,272,17771,5636,6485,68,934,31109,1589,25253,951,1446,417,72476,1900,13,34447,1826,54312,1744,20662,6485,13109,11,39043,28130,665,94721,11,272,17771,1120,1133,3846,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,3869,30517,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,9964,22011,326,52152,41116,409,1208,6485,13109,15878,274,6,269,13327,1765,3625,27389,59958,63934,288,951,1615,316,18543,1759,11,1765,26317,27389,59958,63934,288,665,20272,13,34447,934,17771,54312,1744,39043,1744,1208,6485,13109,15878,274,6,269,13327,30,2998,20272,11,272,17771,1208,10484,13109,409,37392,1744,9189,62822,19610,87158,9189,60534,89,79071,14896,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,11,42676,9189,91329,2182,89,11,6316,89669,11,1370,51173,11,9189,17782,89,3869,62822,35573,951,8554,7010,653,3738,30281,11,9952,5636,6033,40970,294,55624,729,13109,1880,76776,653,3738,35019,339,2727,13,19421,14707,11,8811,75876,43765,11,4502,56316,3625,8554,841,15132,6502,409,3625,7970,4978,13080,7010,514,7970,6141,265,11,15265,89669,841,35737,13080,11083,326,6,8039,3614,13080,18249,648,4881,13,19421,3399,41091,11,4864,66517,326,39982,1100,8942,4558,325,1744,87158,326,54386,60534,79071,14896,11,4502,56316,3900,379,264,21965,409,8554,11,6033,6502,79380,11,6033,4502,3846,841,15132,6502,3625,7970,4978,11,10071,951,1446,417,78871,13080,11083,326,6,8039,3614,13080,18249,648,4881,13,1708,1105,11,5019,296,26248,1814,7010,20662,31747,19135,2428,11,4864,42775,273,9952,951,11909,15878,274,6,269,13327,13,1252,6335,11,272,17771,26077,447,22827,1744,503,34155,1376,978,42844,51854,5347,33903,11,54401,934,35329,45441,13171,409,757,7591,68019,1880,409,11083,7889,11,5636,409,220,1272,8554,3869,10083,1617,648,1744,96642,11,951,8554,409,59811,1437,1354,11,409,72476,266,459,12339,11,409,5355,4618,93848,13,74656,97717,11,11083,7363,118904,75460,11,46152,15132,28463,2107,4893,409,757,57705,978,6091,261,11,1208,10651,409,11083,951,1446,417,13,81245,15132,296,46651,2249,11,46141,447,1821,11,21901,1821,13,19421,77433,3869,326,6,49575,409,11083,7363,978,2749,288,11,4864,94297,39929,1208,17071,100196,1370,95917,359,409,11083,951,1446,417,13,14465,94297,76826,48908,10045,261,11083,951,1446,417,11,3869,951,47104,22299,9189,1880,41091,11,54401,1744,9189,18757,74466,757,13510,11,4502,46152,15132,82134,6033,60014,100063,21965,69125,6033,6502,79380,13,19421,77433,8065,68226,409,1208,20719,2428,11,4864,94297,296,6,8039,19010,12329,1880,47929,9952,51625,1854,1208,10484,13109,409,97418,11,409,44453,1291,1880,409,912,285,47003,11,1744,42182,39929,6316,1589,25253,8065,72476,266,5019,23761,86966,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,25632,12339,1744,3846,57992,11,2486,467,11,6033,7010,3625,49301,11,3869,96586,11,45575,3846,1744,9189,60534,89,79071,14896,11,9189,73953,89,3869,41091,13,19421,9189,2486,812,11,1880,4502,308,17771,6502,21965,6485,68,6033,6502,79380,13,69327,4502,841,296,41901,1922,1188,6502,653,46110,79071,14896,11,54401,1744,9189,26365,74466,11,44829,39043,28130,7364,331,5048,89,13,25145,72,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,7673,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,19,627,198,791,19114,596,1005,315,4443,94066,323,10507,8779,311,5813,264,3717,449,279,10877,13,578,16540,315,6485,3878,1093,330,31548
