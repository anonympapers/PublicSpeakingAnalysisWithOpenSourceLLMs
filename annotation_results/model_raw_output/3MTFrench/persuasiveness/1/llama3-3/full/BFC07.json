{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T09:53:30.761693784Z","response":"Based on the dimension \"In your opinion, how persuasive is the speech in this transcript, i.e., do the person effectively craft a convincing message? Is their reasoning rigorous?\" I evaluate the transcript as follows:\n\nThe speaker presents a personal anecdote about buying a recipe book and shares their experience with online shopping. They criticize the use of big data to manipulate consumers' emotions and decisions. The speaker's tone is conversational, and they use examples to illustrate their points. While the argument is not particularly complex or original, it is well-structured and easy to follow.\n\nI would give this transcript a score of 4 out of 5 on the scale \"not at all\" to \"very much\". The speaker's reasoning is generally sound, and they effectively use anecdotes and examples to make their points. However, the argument could be more nuanced and sophisticated to warrant a perfect score.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,15089,514,47929,11,9189,47592,15878,294,2182,8065,40970,6316,37291,1367,14081,3904,978,326,6,87713,294,48968,2249,40021,35933,13,1252,51173,11,272,17771,1208,38605,4550,324,409,23126,727,11,1647,49348,52827,11,1880,503,34155,7591,21200,978,3930,20028,653,25500,342,69628,2933,72476,266,13,19421,5019,39043,11,4864,91507,1765,8339,5019,78605,1215,951,15471,417,409,1421,6672,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,653,82711,294,6,472,22660,3930,7528,13,1952,757,281,46651,951,15471,417,11,951,1421,47003,409,36105,11,951,577,7031,1824,4010,11,951,296,11206,351,4428,11,293,1116,11,951,586,35933,1765,5690,13,14465,312,20822,275,653,17258,713,294,98279,301,31307,57992,1765,7011,481,83,13,19421,8065,1620,11,503,6,613,66522,1647,56984,409,1421,6672,11,1744,4864,326,34155,79196,68862,514,39580,93658,7010,653,1486,1375,2852,13,9648,55755,22011,11,503,34155,59062,978,3869,99490,9952,1647,100007,23665,11,1620,69068,514,57992,1765,7011,481,83,11,514,16968,264,1323,546,978,294,6,69175,3016,11,5636,293,20243,2058,11,17258,784,978,1370,326,31769,44294,665,348,11178,324,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,3846,82711,294,6,472,22660,3930,7528,11,3846,6636,6316,32118,4919,2428,86906,99188,1880,1891,53904,2428,11,66228,8047,1370,3625,379,42685,1821,3869,31632,951,12823,3930,7528,11,21273,86396,757,9781,16339,11,281,17194,1880,1375,11967,13,46706,514,4382,719,11,409,757,20028,99490,514,54206,75289,466,13,34447,4068,25692,57375,20028,39043,30,80905,71357,66021,934,85217,14848,409,1208,33537,8047,1765,41091,11,1208,2457,12,6496,18920,13,5034,2457,12,6496,18920,11,1208,1541,8047,45165,23349,305,11368,556,1826,409,1208,1391,10610,648,3930,7528,13,1252,28800,1344,2877,519,665,9859,13,34447,436,395,554,89,45325,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,1744,1208,2457,12,6496,18920,11,3900,379,264,28463,409,326,6,28400,467,11,409,326,6,17060,6082,13,445,6,1735,333,409,7011,481,83,11,665,36788,409,59471,11,6824,68,3869,1491,19010,12329,3869,31632,409,57951,11,409,1615,316,18543,1759,1880,294,6,88988,11,3625,22639,2515,84,14014,1765,3846,33651,2249,45740,2530,8065,32118,4919,278,13,3489,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,7010,1208,83067,951,8403,5019,68226,23761,5625,285,1880,99490,11,3869,31632,409,27750,4046,76,41356,7930,15132,665,84440,30,39783,14240,799,86595,8047,11,8065,84364,409,220,1049,19,11,6316,54613,11,2425,355,409,272,6009,21935,11,20605,265,1744,326,6,17060,6082,4046,20202,64829,28068,64,436,57332,3062,7010,514,85424,409,35881,1854,13,445,6,17060,6082,4046,20202,64829,11,1765,864,52985,665,9859,11,294,22827,81337,11,17317,57038,1208,2457,12,6496,18920,7930,17317,29557,294,6,613,1430,15878,991,1762,46429,42563,11,1880,409,326,49455,265,11,17317,57038,20662,4046,49975,7930,17317,77635,3869,8065,1620,59394,6316,1156,7711,8065,48226,6496,409,1208,2457,12,6496,18920,11,10071,8065,21901,1744,45441,45165,23349,479,514,3016,11,8065,62974,409,1208,33537,8047,7010,514,38900,3930,7528,13,4366,346,1744,514,342,69628,2933,8065,1620,1826,14707,4046,6323,3675,12155,72476,1900,11,1880,272,17771,14707,41091,7930,3625,2665,9667,11,1880,1370,8339,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,7673,358,15806,279,36815,439,11263,512,198,791,19114,18911,264,4443,50750,1295,922,12096,264,11363,2363,323,13551,872,3217,449,2930,12185,13,2435,61730,279,1005,315,2466,828,311,37735,13723,6,21958,323,11429,13,578,19114,596,16630,374,7669,1697,11,323,814,1005,10507,311,41468,872,3585,13,6104,279,5811,374,539,8104,6485,477,4113,11,433,374,1664,12,52243,323,4228,311,1833,627,198,40,1053,3041,420,36815,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,389,279,5569,330,1962,520,682,1,311,330,1225,1790,3343,578,19114,596,33811,374,8965,5222,11,323,814,13750,1005,94066,323,10507,311,1304,872,3585,13,4452,11,279,5811,1436,387,810,82891,323,27877,311,7236,264,4832,5573,13,128009],"total_duration":6505810368,"load_duration":219717,"prompt_eval_count":640,"prompt_eval_duration":1211513000,"eval_count":178,"eval_duration":5293377000}
