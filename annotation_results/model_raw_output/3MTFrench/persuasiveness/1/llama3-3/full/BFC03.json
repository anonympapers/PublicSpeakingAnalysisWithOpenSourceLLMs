They provide specific examples of the difficulties faced by individuals who try to navigate different legal systems within the European Union, and argue that a coordinated approach is necessary to ensure that individual rights are respected.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is rigorous and well-structured, with careful consideration given to the challenges posed by different national laws and international conventions. The use of analogies, such as comparing the situation to being an acrobat searching for balance between competing forces, adds to the persuasiveness of the argument.\n\nOverall, the speech is effective in conveying a sense of urgency and importance around this issue, and presents a clear vision for how to address it. While there may be some areas where the speaker's perspective could be challenged or nuanced, overall I believe that the score of 4 out of 5 accurately reflects the persuasiveness and effectiveness of the speech.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,34447,1744,20272,12,6853,409,19189,265,3869,28800,95199,268,949,14465,36731,16422,17194,1880,503,34155,9964,22011,3625,52314,8431,82,13,27058,9189,11,3900,841,274,6,74972,3738,1133,1744,409,4382,16287,13109,23541,13,2998,59157,13109,11,3625,52314,8431,82,11,272,17771,14707,5636,1744,39043,13,356,17771,326,6,49575,951,1180,288,7930,3613,68495,15265,17536,409,15265,4415,24918,55398,81991,15265,10237,13,3298,68,409,4415,24918,11,409,89360,11,409,35881,12416,11,272,17771,15265,48454,294,6,1748,13109,16422,307,2428,1765,1208,88265,15132,1672,38096,82,26725,3625,97222,1744,9189,47592,1645,9383,16968,8065,1317,409,15265,17536,13,33150,19910,409,326,6,33758,95199,26193,11,1880,5636,46680,969,1001,7010,514,38900,1218,1291,11,272,17771,64079,5019,841,6502,23761,11,841,15132,6502,42345,978,8637,81235,312,5259,355,294,22827,14240,266,653,47838,13,12095,9189,35881,579,89,409,30517,261,3625,4156,59307,11,5019,9189,44152,27584,27138,5019,4046,81,3212,7010,653,47838,21935,11,653,14240,266,3930,62321,409,829,5945,424,467,295,978,11,5019,653,2098,355,978,409,16456,3458,66014,653,1180,68,11,66021,934,35329,841,8024,6502,3869,829,83187,82291,13,2998,1794,2727,11,7010,3846,21935,11,26317,97222,78871,41518,355,13,41621,308,58736,1601,1339,5636,16422,307,81235,13,452,6,24677,402,52009,6824,68,3869,14240,664,1291,27750,96642,15082,1880,9071,10333,409,88817,9211,6316,3738,68,38793,951,83229,86709,409,64079,13,27058,51913,2058,11,653,13088,373,11826,11,12985,978,665,9822,11,1208,282,9011,1557,817,11,11083,91806,1439,11,409,409,43406,13088,373,3930,37194,11,41079,51084,665,1708,3516,24812,13,2998,37622,1744,16422,17194,11,503,34155,951,704,8839,3869,7643,46096,13,11876,45593,2655,367,3916,11,3625,83229,70,91555,95199,729,11,3625,18027,5512,11,3625,35881,6948,409,1208,6377,409,12437,409,326,6,33758,95199,26193,11,3625,94527,7546,288,409,1208,6377,95199,26193,11,951,97222,409,326,6,87713,13,8242,3625,447,37907,11,4864,296,53149,84,648,5019,27389,4120,3625,97222,3930,6681,2303,268,95199,268,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,10045,261,2192,27584,6316,6425,13509,1604,13,27058,62998,841,6502,75831,653,1180,68,5016,1765,514,43014,87264,1672,38096,11,665,14902,9952,3625,29124,83,1900,11,951,97222,21901,2908,12249,11,7930,841,92215,56316,23761,1323,285,665,5353,13,1252,1180,68,294,57286,266,8431,95199,268,13,34447,55455,308,17771,28068,978,11,1880,22299,653,4046,447,31059,265,17194,11,503,49152,685,665,88817,11943,514,77411,4046,447,31059,265,9465,294,22827,81337,11,3625,1218,32029,951,29124,83,1900,1880,409,326,49455,265,11,1208,22848,978,951,23496,355,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,6492,315,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,304,3878,315,279,24613,300,13071,323,27375,315,279,8982,627,198,791,19114,11,264,16422,380,11,18911,264,2867,323,29722,5811,922,279,12939,315,49183,323,22973,279,16188,3268,315,7665,10495,13,2435,3493,3230,10507,315,279,27129,17011,555,7931,889,1456,311,21546,2204,5897,6067,2949,279,7665,9323,11,323,18046,430,264,47672,5603,374,5995,311,6106,430,3927,3268,527,31387,627,198,791,19114,596,33811,374,47999,323,1664,12,52243,11,449,16994,18361,2728,311,279,11774,37260,555,2204,5426,7016,323,6625,45593,13,578,1005,315,24291,552,11,1778,439,27393,279,6671,311,1694,459,1645,76201,15389,369,8335,1990,27260,8603,11,11621,311,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,5811,627,198,28589,11,279,8982,374,7524,304,94165,264,5647,315,54917,323,12939,2212,420,4360,11,323,18911,264,2867,11376,369,1268,311,2686,433,13,6104,1070,1253,387,1063,5789,1405,279,19114,596,13356,1436,387,29991,477,82891,11,8244,358,4510,430,279,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,30357,27053,279,24613,300,13071,323,27375,315,279,8982,13,128009],"total_duration":7906792090,"load_duration":212019,"prompt_eval_count":540,"prompt_eval_duration":1082192000,"eval_count":230,"eval_duration":6823712000}
