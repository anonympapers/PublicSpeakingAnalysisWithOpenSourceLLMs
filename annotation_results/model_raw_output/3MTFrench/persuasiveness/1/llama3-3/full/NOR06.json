{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T10:03:59.025118667Z","response":"Based on the dimension \"In your opinion, how persuasive is the speech in this transcript, i.e., do the person effectively craft a convincing message? Is their reasoning rigorous?\" and the scale from 1=not at all to 5=very much, I would give a score of **4**.\n\nThe speaker uses storytelling techniques to engage the audience and make the topic more relatable. They use vivid descriptions and metaphors (\"Jeanette est votre lentille de contact\", \"la lumière qui brie fort\") to create a sense of intrigue and curiosity. The speaker also uses personal experiences and analogies (\"je suis chimiste... je fabrique des molécules\") to illustrate the significance of their research.\n\nThe reasoning is generally rigorous, with clear explanations of the problem (dégénéressence) and the potential solutions (using existing molecules to slow down symptoms). The speaker effectively connects their research to a real-world issue, making it more accessible and relevant to the audience. However, some parts of the speech could be improved by providing more concrete evidence or data to support their claims.\n\nOverall, the speaker's persuasive skills are effective, and they do a good job of crafting a convincing message that engages the audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,6,2706,81356,9189,15473,444,466,6316,87810,13,62408,87810,11,272,17771,73103,409,20263,6672,13,19421,20263,6672,11,27549,42775,273,10878,13,64105,64,503,41901,16796,59062,978,3869,28800,84364,665,27584,27138,1744,1208,650,9769,10367,11,1370,50590,379,14240,580,409,53050,1880,27549,513,4751,483,11,42676,9189,35881,579,89,409,1208,4864,30872,466,22299,6316,70311,523,12119,751,668,71632,11,66021,1744,20263,6672,11,272,17771,15265,48907,4618,409,3729,13,19421,653,57992,11,20263,6672,1826,7010,1208,3678,265,409,829,3044,409,326,6,306,4618,409,3729,3369,17060,8047,13,19421,27549,73953,7010,653,4499,7010,15265,71632,409,9120,593,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,514,294,20432,13,41621,62299,1206,72671,5512,11,9189,47592,934,31109,6233,648,11,272,17771,294,6,14283,9189,1153,261,77558,15265,47528,1499,3457,12339,27389,69,68862,13,34447,20263,6672,11,27549,1826,39015,11,45889,281,5518,13,7695,47090,48908,1208,23008,9211,13,1708,1105,11,9189,436,5615,19610,1744,9189,665,1213,89,15265,44695,1880,1744,9189,3460,10333,15265,16530,409,7591,40241,409,48907,31355,13,41621,12584,89,68226,665,12025,49120,665,653,28800,961,412,7010,15265,71632,409,9120,593,13,19421,9604,265,1208,41263,20712,13,19421,39015,11,22299,7010,15265,47528,1499,3457,12339,27389,69,68862,11,9189,12584,89,68226,45347,43905,1208,71632,409,9120,593,3869,1208,41263,20712,13,2998,9189,834,519,11,45575,11,934,17771,54312,934,54386,264,30,19421,3399,12584,89,9189,4046,76,5615,9211,32592,26317,20043,2249,11,1167,978,4749,38672,82,11,9189,12584,89,2536,6502,46131,6316,259,9011,1557,409,29340,3869,1370,99746,8065,8309,11,10071,14707,11,20263,6672,13,445,6496,11,282,9769,21152,13,46706,20662,87810,11,20263,6672,1826,3846,934,54386,917,6853,6316,272,1260,6160,1640,2428,7930,1826,4499,84,7010,514,83259,6485,68,409,15265,71632,409,9120,593,13,19421,9189,62299,951,88704,288,13,6178,72,11,503,6,2295,76,3675,5019,274,6,306,49530,12329,13,37407,261,4502,9189,55162,41881,13,3959,704,8839,7930,82133,9189,29557,10367,409,85877,440,261,20263,6672,11,7930,274,17771,20272,1208,8811,13,62463,704,8839,97569,23761,69406,11,22299,6316,41263,20712,7930,293,7379,7010,514,56662,13,469,9112,5118,13559,11,39587,6316,41263,20712,7930,293,7379,12108,13,19421,76776,11,272,17771,326,31769,302,333,13,356,17771,326,31769,302,333,11,39043,76605,13510,934,54386,348,14210,1744,20263,6672,308,96287,6502,1208,15119,49606,409,3091,588,2249,3869,81337,11,66021,1744,9189,47592,1208,282,3516,818,409,18728,4150,308,6,351,404,45441,13,1708,1105,11,4864,9189,1370,273,409,6160,38469,41199,16968,3869,326,6,75876,13,34447,41091,11,4864,36731,38094,17194,13,14465,9765,34395,951,22337,20243,2482,13,19421,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,274,55624,295,12329,6316,22337,20243,2482,11,7930,264,6502,294,6,14283,85877,440,261,51625,285,42625,13,39783,8811,329,648,409,326,6,52822,61480,7010,514,719,7010,1208,94721,1880,514,89714,13,62408,8811,329,648,11,9189,47592,25692,85815,46939,69379,84,89504,665,23933,519,1208,1391,24812,409,6225,31617,8082,3869,1208,43116,9465,26633,50510,15081,1880,47528,13,356,17771,1208,7591,309,978,4355,13,423,19395,32453,676,768,11,7643,11957,12339,11,908,8047,3869,326,6,9011,713,13,19421,5019,1097,73511,15171,514,89714,11,3900,757,47090,26633,79165,13,5034,272,15433,978,27727,11,39587,20263,6672,1880,6502,3625,3091,588,2249,11,1880,653,8450,41263,483,2249,5019,85877,440,261,13,27058,1208,272,15433,978,9035,13109,11,503,34155,4046,501,1412,978,1208,44615,3257,648,1880,6316,22337,20243,2482,3073,5048,1880,594,7003,648,3930,326,93847,13,46408,1826,4635,84,5019,436,69261,404,3625,12104,9769,9004,409,8811,329,648,11,10071,281,14140,554,409,25945,28800,514,66167,3930,34922,13,356,17771,92759,519,5019,41091,66021,1744,39043,76605,13510,934,80720,1826,46939,19266,772,333,13,34447,893,593,409,51527,6033,77818,43765,25692,85815,13,46408,308,17771,6502,41263,483,2249,13,1708,1105,41091,28463,11,503,34155,2098,321,978,7643,97045,11,503,34155,59062,978,7643,523,483,1880,1437,4618,1370,293,2827,13,14465,66517,3703,462,1880,7643,22337,20243,2482,13,14465,36731,3846,934,41901,1913,13,5034,41263,20712,45441,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,7673,323,279,5569,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,2
