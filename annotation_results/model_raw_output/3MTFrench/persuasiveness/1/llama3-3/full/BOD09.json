{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T09:57:13.471784425Z","response":"Based on the provided transcript, I evaluate the persuasive speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by sharing their personal experience and expertise as a pedagogical counselor at the University of La Rochelle. They pose relevant questions about the current state of higher education and highlight the need for transformation to address the challenges faced by students and educators. The speaker also shares their own research hypothesis, which adds credibility to their argument.\n\nThe speech is well-structured, with clear transitions between ideas. The speaker uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"l'enseignement est une activité très solitaire\") and metaphors (\"la construction d'une nouvelle identité de l'ancien recherche\"). These devices enhance the persuasiveness of the message.\n\nOne aspect that could improve the persuasive power of the speech is the use of more concrete examples and data to support the speaker's claims. While they do provide some statistics about students not finding employment matching their qualifications, more specific numbers or case studies would strengthen their argument.\n\nOverall, however, I believe that the speaker has presented a compelling and well-structured argument, making it an effective public performance.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,91507,9189,20028,6316,2389,5397,11,44829,593,503,34155,59062,978,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,757,6225,653,28800,3846,934,85217,1022,3833,645,13,14465,36731,294,26248,670,12844,5048,665,26633,90272,76132,11,10071,4864,36731,28463,31025,484,12339,10696,55180,2428,3869,326,22827,1986,13109,409,1208,36969,6853,13,19421,3869,3846,64160,11,4864,66517,48901,409,1647,57951,294,6,71484,13,507,8772,651,68636,11,39043,11412,23761,79380,51794,3869,342,52424,26725,3625,49301,13,2998,27138,11,31025,484,12339,10696,55180,2428,11,503,6,582,5807,24812,3625,68061,625,1821,409,326,22827,1986,13109,7010,1208,18475,409,28130,95234,13,34447,294,3695,1474,6870,11,74940,1826,326,48968,2868,273,409,326,6,1137,625,1133,1043,57663,75804,88253,30,64105,64,34280,7998,11,7010,1647,11159,13109,11,389,77554,12339,1744,326,41901,3841,84,1826,17028,978,11,326,6,4302,290,85505,294,22827,5636,6800,13026,294,57286,21178,1821,13,2582,1180,77776,11,389,738,349,1744,29449,72601,294,6,1137,625,1133,281,48099,3869,75871,265,3869,653,19227,665,3841,84,11,9952,951,14240,21178,1821,7930,26725,3625,47104,7930,409,326,22827,1986,13109,15132,17347,9769,9004,11,6033,7930,841,26483,688,6502,294,6,31310,285,3869,1208,6520,40095,409,28130,46160,13,7695,1826,39587,4433,4469,5019,326,22827,1986,13109,409,513,43678,13,62408,18475,2109,974,1765,653,68061,625,1133,39239,978,2536,5636,1765,514,47929,11,10071,1765,3625,14240,21178,1821,25400,98375,13,1221,5192,4558,79507,11,934,17771,54312,1744,39043,1879,57609,30,19421,14707,11,389,11412,52895,716,951,281,15433,55180,648,1180,1924,11,45889,3930,42775,665,3941,46494,11,5019,29557,10367,3869,326,57286,21178,1821,409,52895,716,951,75332,2436,9604,1157,7010,514,38900,85505,13,7695,379,264,951,47104,3869,76076,308,7085,409,2848,934,54386,348,76019,1824,3159,7930,264,1367,14081,3904,951,55744,8467,9721,15844,13,34447,1826,54312,1744,45602,8657,275,3869,43678,514,72601,30,35211,1133,6502,11,16968,7591,10188,978,11,39587,409,45347,409,45889,28271,13399,14014,11,3869,6316,9517,6853,5276,8047,1765,11191,951,55744,8467,7010,326,52152,10663,13,19421,22299,503,26248,547,3625,47371,285,11,272,17771,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,34447,4068,71751,653,68061,625,1133,934,35329,379,3625,308,17771,27584,6502,32980,41199,220,508,8261,11,294,6,370,11283,1215,951,6183,21237,951,30597,13,27058,41091,11,4538,1208,8246,294,31109,48659,3608,13109,409,326,6,1149,3675,38317,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,409,18475,3284,13,7695,308,59858,264,6502,409,8246,3608,60224,3284,11,4502,389,308,26248,27584,6502,3625,68061,625,1821,3869,4046,73931,1880,3869,58673,15610,6667,91640,13,507,2005,11,665,5589,514,80259,11,272,17771,1744,326,6,1137,625,1133,1826,6316,4197,13109,25945,2092,60224,13,1708,1105,4068,274,59858,59394,30,3206,45455,4558,325,1826,934,35329,47090,48021,3625,48577,665,2389,5397,11,5019,934,80720,513,3288,68,13171,409,274,6,833,1435,7010,27750,6667,22589,13,11583,79641,1132,68,6824,68,3869,75831,951,6667,22589,409,42775,9952,3625,68061,625,1821,98733,17724,1880,20028,665,80444,1744,27750,6667,22589,528,4558,70,1157,5208,91640,653,40351,14425,275,1765,514,68061,59110,11,10071,28463,951,1732,36527,11398,266,22589,11,951,1180,38647,3930,38900,3674,82653,2428,11,1880,14707,4046,1325,336,479,951,14240,21178,1821,13,426,1116,11,326,6,49575,951,1180,38647,5019,6316,9517,6853,18475,3930,72601,11,1880,272,17771,39015,39723,39043,513,4684,2428,13,4366,346,1744,41091,28463,11,4864,66517,48901,3930,72601,13,1708,1105,9189,12584,89,757,13510,10071,4068,25692,85815,1744,9964,3026,285,6316,38317,2764,1880,282,2205,13,19421,14707,11,4864,91507,296,804,951,1218,2171,80463,1880,951,36744,9517,12287,22589,13,14465,91507,8678,805,951,36788,409,42775,294,6,370,541,9952,3625,68061,625,1821,11,10071,28463,9952,3625,14240,21178,1821,1880,9952,1208,31025,484,12339,281,15433,55180,2428,13,2895,66096,3869,20662,38317,11,503,6,25632,12339,6044,8977,10253,18803,27476,3808,281,15433,55180,8467,409,326,6,1137,625,1133,1043,57663,55467,13,19421,3869,1208,84788,635,294,22827,5636,6800,13026,294,57286,21178,1821,11,45889,779,285,2922,6496,53454,11,45889,779,285,2922,6496,1370,2126,13,34447,294,3695,39587,11,9189,841,1765,74466,6502,665,5542,294,6,31830,6316,23846,85815,11,3846,7930,513,259,6,49133,949,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,3984,36815,11,358,15806,279,66343,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,19
