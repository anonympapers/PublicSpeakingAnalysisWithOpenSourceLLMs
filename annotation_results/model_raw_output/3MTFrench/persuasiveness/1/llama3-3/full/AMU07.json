{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T10:00:17.858651625Z","response":"Based on the dimension \"How persuasive is the speech in this transcript?\" I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as a score of **4** out of 5.\n\nThe speaker presents their research and findings in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to follow along. They also provide context and explain the significance of their study, which helps to engage the audience and make the message more convincing. The use of specific examples and statistics (e.g., \"Plus de 70 000 bébés n'est se pré-maturemement chaque année.\") adds credibility to their argument. Additionally, the speaker's passion and commitment to helping premature babies are evident throughout the speech, which makes the audience more likely to be persuaded by their message.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score of 5 is that the speech could benefit from some more rhetorical devices (e.g., metaphors, analogies) to make it more engaging and memorable. However, overall, the speaker presents a strong and persuasive case for why their research is important and how it can make a positive impact on premature babies.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,39783,37291,43905,37417,11,45602,9189,61158,6853,78705,55755,951,5945,1055,17260,13,46706,20662,37417,11,56321,60404,15132,38605,652,17060,2693,42625,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,33670,1208,1913,27389,46790,409,1208,20547,24201,13,2998,9822,11,5636,409,220,2031,220,931,90551,65,5512,308,17771,513,27389,1474,1598,76,1133,46777,76132,13,62463,56321,60404,11,37953,447,85217,15132,38605,652,17060,2693,42625,11,14848,24560,8952,285,5512,665,2532,409,38605,263,266,38469,13,362,5589,409,15765,15610,6033,5088,268,404,28130,14240,266,409,77323,11,951,779,1354,294,6,5599,80284,2249,15132,20272,26725,3625,49301,11,22299,653,27389,2922,4558,7986,274,2379,258,11,6033,6316,98741,1370,514,308,8047,5019,3625,91878,3869,33515,261,13,27058,9189,71751,6316,887,8047,11,46152,14848,1207,72,50026,220,605,779,1354,294,6,5599,80284,2249,46777,9880,13,19421,40744,220,22,25595,77660,7930,14848,348,20243,84,16968,90551,92174,11412,39929,951,1615,978,45045,55398,81991,220,22,8261,409,17536,11,22299,6316,6225,40948,978,83832,8047,3869,1208,25595,36077,11,7591,376,41572,8065,53052,3930,8859,425,409,1208,13550,978,71,2711,1880,409,1208,32118,97495,11,27389,4338,519,3869,1080,7711,17108,31037,5636,2267,1260,11,3869,220,22,8261,11,908,8047,3869,220,22,25595,77660,13,356,17771,5019,39043,934,35329,1826,3242,14081,50848,409,13836,1435,31914,6480,1208,25595,36077,951,550,17060,2693,5512,13,27058,27389,43406,27750,1615,978,45045,11,1208,25595,36077,951,550,17060,2693,5512,513,84921,9952,3625,28003,1233,11,1880,3625,1719,75104,4571,72,1640,8467,22299,326,52374,69,34395,665,23087,339,18029,13,3298,77776,11,17317,74533,25945,4017,5512,7010,3625,39455,409,13836,3531,409,1208,25595,36077,1744,17317,17258,85,2439,59157,12329,13,362,32384,11,7643,270,4558,325,11,9189,264,4046,26591,978,4502,514,20272,409,48021,326,93847,294,6,75876,3930,63828,9783,3869,4809,11,3869,81337,294,31109,1826,3930,550,17060,2693,978,11,42844,653,550,19010,4558,7986,274,2379,258,11,29557,409,48416,8977,829,25595,36077,13,27058,45602,11,4864,757,2385,13,8242,6316,14240,799,11715,1295,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,6316,38920,14240,799,75765,5019,274,6,395,7889,1744,326,55624,47698,9952,326,93847,294,6,75876,3930,63828,9783,3869,4809,1826,66517,481,665,95234,11,37622,5019,3625,296,31539,1744,5019,3625,4225,2923,59307,1880,6316,32118,2629,49586,13,32118,2629,49586,1826,653,6800,3937,5019,13510,934,54386,264,5906,40126,11,3625,100246,409,51854,14240,29246,934,54386,46939,24560,86595,5512,1880,934,54386,264,20272,951,5935,82,20719,8467,13,24703,7930,594,7003,11,272,17771,16968,294,6,370,541,514,893,593,294,57286,29246,8065,27389,2203,20243,333,81235,951,550,17060,2693,5512,11,1744,326,93847,294,6,75876,3930,63828,9783,3869,4809,80664,1339,1208,5636,31914,580,11,1880,1744,1208,98304,8082,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,6316,91518,33482,8047,3869,326,93847,294,6,75876,11,33670,514,550,19010,4558,7986,11,29557,30532,409,48416,8977,41869,25843,1208,25595,36077,8065,4545,3930,550,19010,4558,7986,13,5034,98304,8082,264,44093,24560,2515,361,648,9952,951,89137,1759,1989,1104,72,2053,13,24703,42844,3625,550,17060,2693,5512,308,6,546,6502,44093,1208,6140,409,74282,66014,326,93847,294,6,75876,3930,63828,9783,3869,4809,11,1880,39587,294,93825,44526,3675,9952,20662,73994,324,2922,6496,13,356,17771,5019,45602,1744,4864,91507,38211,11,4502,326,93847,294,6,75876,3930,63828,9783,3869,4809,29557,409,48416,8977,326,26248,25595,36077,8065,4545,3930,550,19010,4558,7986,11,1880,4502,514,282,15433,425,6033,259,26248,6316,1391,22550,3869,81337,294,31109,4046,10194,361,665,16968,2442,84,85434,11,29557,409,48416,8977,41869,25843,1208,25595,36077,8065,4545,3930,550,19010,4558,7986,13,3206,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,6044,8977,3869,27389,43406,3625,1615,978,45045,409,326,26248,25595,36077,5019,3625,56321,60404,409,20662,37417,1880,5019,3625,220,1399,220,931,550,17060,2693,5512,55467,46777,76132,13,25145,72,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,4438,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,7673,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,264,5573,315,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,18911,872,3495,323,14955,304,264,2867,323,64694,11827,11,3339,433,4228,311,1833,3235,13,2435,1101,3493,2317,323,10552,279,26431,315,872,4007,11,902,8779,311,16988,279,10877,323,1304,279,1984,810,40661,13,578,1005,315,3230,10507,323,13443,320,68,13,70,263
