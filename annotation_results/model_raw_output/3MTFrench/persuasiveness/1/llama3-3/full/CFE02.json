{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T10:24:47.528420966Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I evaluate the persuasiveness of the speech to be 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker presents a convincing message by highlighting the importance of recycling and upcycling organic waste into valuable materials. They effectively use anecdotes and personal experiences to illustrate their point, making it more relatable and engaging for the audience. The speaker's reasoning is also rigorous, as they provide specific examples and details about their research and experimentation with lignin.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give a perfect score of 5 is that the speech could benefit from a clearer structure and organization. At times, the ideas and thoughts seem to be presented in a somewhat disorganized manner, which might make it harder for the audience to follow along. However, overall, the speaker's passion and conviction are evident, making their message more compelling and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,26248,547,3625,7591,331,1441,13,41621,26483,19610,829,33288,665,27584,27138,13,57702,1208,10484,13109,1343,5169,13703,817,409,7591,331,1441,934,54386,264,934,31109,296,1130,1765,20662,3197,66522,11,64972,4499,5512,264,3212,1744,3625,7591,1985,5512,13,1708,1105,11,4502,389,864,77,1339,779,258,409,12155,7591,331,1441,11,259,21198,5019,2558,556,3930,26365,1291,11,389,69152,3930,66304,11,272,17771,14707,4635,84,13,46706,8941,11741,1339,11,1208,2849,1130,305,3538,13,34447,11,389,78422,12339,28463,8065,21765,220,1041,11990,409,52021,1370,459,11,409,1647,7591,331,1441,27389,69,68862,13,5034,72700,483,11,26633,90272,75164,3682,60224,3930,66304,13,1952,841,829,275,6502,75249,20028,45575,389,326,26248,1437,30872,273,5019,2558,556,409,326,31769,64374,13,435,2957,1826,54312,409,21273,258,30,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,46838,404,569,64656,33254,424,1208,72700,483,951,1344,8836,288,13,14465,52571,42463,1744,72353,668,264,14448,69068,3846,7591,331,1441,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,4864,56445,46939,1370,8464,6316,5017,978,3869,1208,72700,483,13,14465,25400,21559,951,463,339,978,1572,5019,1208,9517,533,1553,8065,53052,409,27750,19670,288,294,6,61263,70,48099,13,46408,312,59976,3930,97418,951,1376,288,11,97507,11,39043,296,26248,16603,3625,1400,31539,49806,288,13,9240,68,829,16458,554,8841,1640,2428,13,432,5512,495,266,409,829,19266,36235,369,51084,9952,1208,2849,1130,305,3538,13,27058,1208,65827,268,404,11,4864,25400,30179,6960,653,47838,7591,331,1441,13,386,5014,12,466,417,436,2642,645,409,7643,38672,82,11,514,72006,12,39754,74801,438,13,34447,4502,9189,23933,10333,3846,7591,331,1441,11,934,54386,25692,46131,490,32453,7010,1208,11277,409,1208,4671,8511,13,27058,28130,10607,11,4864,9517,1072,285,757,1765,665,281,3023,265,13,32429,4502,9964,274,6,300,993,13559,22299,39043,46206,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,11,272,3433,978,41091,11,7591,331,1441,5636,7591,331,1441,11,39043,2489,13,51097,26633,463,339,978,11932,75460,15132,19227,1001,37608,36527,7930,514,1913,79738,1370,71751,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,13,39783,80444,409,88247,2428,5790,10676,978,11,6160,536,78130,11,63828,1414,665,36292,1880,90551,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,8162,1474,978,376,2428,11,4864,326,6,49133,7010,3625,4647,485,417,951,9986,645,13,14465,514,490,33462,554,11,4864,326,6,44803,325,11,4864,75765,829,31807,4011,32118,4919,2428,13,1252,2816,25692,23761,1744,2486,467,11,5019,3869,312,10398,15170,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,7010,3625,757,392,645,409,12155,31547,1572,11,1208,348,87960,3869,1208,81645,11,1208,1080,593,409,12155,43116,17144,11,1370,1647,42775,1880,665,14448,285,519,1880,4046,67,5615,9211,22299,1208,4671,483,11,503,6,391,45808,6316,6425,27220,8065,1323,16491,951,88247,8467,2425,355,3930,281,10515,5898,13,19421,97507,11,9189,23933,10333,11,9952,653,1437,258,409,68567,44618,28463,11,389,25692,20028,1860,11967,514,38900,13,4418,66,97507,11,46152,15132,19227,1001,37608,36527,7930,33537,306,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,8162,1474,978,376,2428,11,503,6,49133,3625,78352,409,326,6,867,75,1082,11,389,523,2428,13,2009,9517,79,10515,306,11,389,2109,1339,326,6,90446,13,19421,4160,321,6496,11,39587,503,34155,5906,409,17571,951,297,398,325,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,3984,11,358,15806,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,311,387,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,18911,264,40661,1984,555,39686,279,12939,315,34978,323,709,66,16404,17808,12571,1139,15525,7384,13,2435,13750,1005,94066,323,4443,11704,311,41468,872,1486,11,3339,433,810,1375,15436,323,23387,369,279,10877,13,578,19114,596,33811,374,1101,47999,11,439,814,3493,3230,10507,323,3649,922,872,3495,323,66196,449,72700,258,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,264,4832,5573,315,220,20,374,430,279,8982,1436,8935,505,264,49479,6070,323,7471,13,2468,3115,11,279,6848,323,11555,2873,311,387,10666,304,264,14738,834,63316,11827,11,902,2643,1304,433,16127,369,279,10877,311,1833,3235,13,4452,11,8244,11,279,19114,596,11939,323,29191,527,30576,11,3339,872,1984,810,29722,323,66343,13,128009],"total_duration":6445883946,"load_duration":141502,"prompt_eval_count":687,"prompt_eval_duration":1327010000,"eval_count":171,"eval_duration":5118340000}
