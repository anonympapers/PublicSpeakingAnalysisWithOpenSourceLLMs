They effectively argue that the construction of contextualized language is essential for children's linguistic development and that parents' involvement is crucial in this process. The speech also highlights the importance of considering sociocultural factors, such as family values and language attitudes, when supporting children's language learning.\n\nThe only aspect that prevents me from giving a score of 5 out of 5 is the occasional lack of clarity or coherence in some sections, particularly when discussing complex sociocultural issues. However, overall, the speaker's message is well-crafted, persuasive, and effectively communicated.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,9189,22114,3869,96586,46131,3930,81337,409,326,31769,56745,5634,5571,273,5019,9189,30179,1992,7643,270,4558,325,665,8198,409,326,31769,34985,13,622,34155,9964,22011,1208,8246,3930,1317,425,259,31769,2196,940,285,8047,665,96282,93424,13,46206,3625,60404,14848,65385,409,1208,59157,13109,1765,326,6,25108,273,294,6,50742,11015,11,10071,7010,653,2317,68,8766,3365,8753,9469,2192,6354,3675,11,66021,1744,1765,1647,14701,273,11,514,55467,308,17771,6502,52842,42625,1208,96282,5634,5571,273,13,2009,8859,425,951,66251,285,5512,11,272,17771,514,1317,425,934,54386,69152,81186,5019,3625,12253,5512,951,2267,1220,951,79165,7930,841,15132,6502,30179,812,8065,4545,39723,326,54386,1370,273,13,1398,3342,301,11,42844,6316,4197,13109,11,665,2317,68,11,389,62163,3869,653,33632,519,3846,1744,20272,829,97686,1037,13,7695,75871,11,27549,11,27549,11,550,685,11,1880,27549,2322,39015,13,356,17771,25692,85815,49733,11,10071,3900,20605,265,3625,48577,1880,3625,2909,1441,1880,389,514,60946,66021,1744,3625,2267,1220,15132,665,5542,409,513,7591,583,1565,11,272,17771,3930,8859,425,665,6671,13,362,27389,12,9035,13109,11,60475,2317,68,11,389,25400,62163,409,12253,978,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,13,7695,22011,3869,326,93847,11,16968,3869,326,6,75876,11,294,94572,15273,1208,281,7379,11,1208,1099,48099,1880,1208,628,5048,7010,514,281,9769,13,1952,326,53149,1137,951,48577,1880,951,2909,1441,11,3900,42182,75144,653,8859,425,87451,66251,69068,5636,51625,285,13,27058,62998,274,55624,978,676,261,8065,8859,425,951,66251,285,5512,757,13510,89,9189,30,14751,8246,1826,4043,306,13327,13,3341,16968,8065,1317,409,829,1156,7569,13109,11,653,33013,79351,3567,14687,4046,3415,16339,951,59682,409,5636,665,5636,951,66251,285,5512,409,5636,665,5636,671,496,1339,13,1708,1105,11,4068,91878,12155,60404,3869,514,19477,52750,3846,8859,425,30,393,9425,593,1208,8246,3930,8859,425,11,22299,389,513,86100,294,49152,13603,326,54386,376,978,3869,326,31769,56745,5634,5571,273,11,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,38317,1826,7591,67,664,57567,7591,55923,90859,11,326,6,39883,425,46679,13,5034,85722,15890,3625,6699,88778,306,43153,60404,7010,1208,8246,3930,8859,425,47289,2196,940,69068,13,34447,5019,93381,71933,20662,1665,333,11,17317,3567,2439,5899,404,42463,951,1719,75104,409,15983,511,10745,75,645,52047,645,7930,28068,306,653,436,57332,4043,306,13327,13,1952,1826,20272,3869,326,31769,56745,3625,60404,409,1499,83889,97569,19477,52750,514,8859,425,951,66251,285,5512,665,96282,93424,11,7930,1826,3869,96282,409,326,31769,56745,1880,76076,1719,75104,56311,2018,8977,20662,8246,13,4366,51173,11,1208,51304,17780,361,8065,8859,425,13,35211,288,8689,1499,83889,56311,23761,665,5107,978,2145,12,6496,82489,951,8859,1157,13,62463,2138,31355,7930,841,16456,3458,79738,13080,1208,51304,409,1208,326,5048,7561,38672,82,26584,958,67,635,3869,326,31769,56745,11,8065,97739,9326,409,62891,11,13080,73103,409,1208,96282,93424,11,737,981,978,3869,326,31769,56745,3869,1208,27584,4046,5481,593,1880,14707,27750,2138,31355,56311,27389,69,52424,514,296,19010,853,951,8859,1157,13,4366,51173,11,64972,514,1391,78440,409,4068,3625,6699,88778,306,43153,60404,7010,1208,8246,3930,8859,425,7591,2196,940,69068,13,33150,5363,1880,1719,75104,15983,511,10745,75,645,11,17317,91878,64,3869,945,404,8065,81337,951,2138,31355,5019,1744,3625,60404,11,3869,1208,84143,409,326,31769,56745,5634,5571,273,11,779,1188,7010,3625,79713,4787,5019,917,9484,265,3869,326,31769,56745,11,4864,9189,312,1195,25134,11,7643,554,817,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,32390,84,300,13071,1,323,13126,279,8982,596,33811,11,6070,11,323,8244,5536,11,358,1053,3041,420,36815,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,18911,872,3495,14955,304,264,2867,323,64694,11827,11,1701,9959,10507,311,41468,872,3585,13,2435,13750,18046,430,279,8246,315,66251,1534,4221,374,7718,369,2911,596,65767,4500,323,430,6699,6,22315,374,16996,304,420,1920,13,578,8982,1101,22020,279,12939,315,13126,15983,511,44547,9547,11,1778,439,3070,2819,323,4221,33726,11,994,12899,2911,596,4221,6975,627,198,791,1193,13189,430,29034,757,505,7231,264,5573,315,220,20,704,315,220,20,374,279,28961,6996,315,32373,477,78925,304,1063,14491,11,8104,994,25394,6485,15983,511,44547,4819,13,4452,11,8244,11,279,19114,596,1984,374,1664,1824,61869,11,66343,11,323,13750,59035,13,128009],"total_duration":6640207763,"load_duration":245
