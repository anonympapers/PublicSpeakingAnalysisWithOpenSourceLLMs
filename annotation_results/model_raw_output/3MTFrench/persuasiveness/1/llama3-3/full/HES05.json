They use storytelling techniques to engage the audience and make complex concepts more accessible. The speaker's reasoning is rigorous, and they provide concrete examples to support their arguments.\n\n**Score:** 4 (out of 5)\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that there are some minor issues with pacing and clarity in certain sections. However, overall, the speech is well-structured, engaging, and effectively conveys the speaker's message.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,82405,404,2727,1744,17317,74533,26725,2107,4893,409,550,15433,556,3869,1208,96586,13,3489,6870,30,41621,841,757,272,3433,10333,6502,30,14465,91507,9189,514,7591,1677,95920,13,12095,4864,35456,82,1647,100007,22299,272,76832,1880,1744,4864,9189,4160,458,3869,41091,11,1744,11412,2442,57375,513,45347,30,4275,98676,519,6502,11,9189,55162,41881,1647,100007,11,9189,9604,10333,1370,88026,1880,25692,85815,513,272,34858,13,41621,23933,10333,39723,9189,62299,26725,2107,4893,409,27389,35573,3625,1615,978,45045,294,31109,1957,7930,841,841,829,275,6502,35597,59157,12329,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,22343,13,19421,17317,11,4864,834,934,85217,14848,20662,23878,13109,26725,3625,49301,665,54008,1291,5019,59394,951,35881,6948,13,4366,51173,11,4502,4864,5320,2249,917,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,1744,503,53149,6853,14707,4046,1325,336,479,26725,3625,49301,11,1744,42182,12,3841,20028,30,7695,47090,1744,4864,27389,13223,546,978,3625,282,3233,11,1744,4864,514,7591,424,583,4618,11,1744,503,34155,7010,1208,9517,4581,13603,11,1744,4864,52571,653,99077,7010,1208,34024,5019,665,5589,1208,12077,978,13,19421,272,76832,11,5019,46777,14240,2070,11,503,34155,20272,1744,9964,6316,22343,13,24703,1744,17317,11457,2439,409,20028,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,46524,6316,16578,294,91655,5019,93381,71933,653,1665,333,11,274,53149,6853,1208,3197,2461,1880,514,270,25253,12717,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,22425,81235,11,1208,3197,2461,1826,653,951,8106,288,28405,1045,1759,409,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,3869,1208,14175,285,409,75831,951,29807,22299,66090,63484,13,27058,66056,7930,841,514,74282,79738,6502,11,4160,3457,4905,3928,978,13,24703,12585,3154,263,638,7591,981,978,1765,21725,665,220,1049,19,264,24560,7591,6595,978,3900,379,264,45889,5347,33903,42138,220,868,65838,409,82134,4046,2032,12249,3600,1880,220,868,65838,409,3197,2461,13,24703,42844,11,5019,1744,829,3197,2461,34501,818,11,3900,47090,934,35329,513,2503,361,7010,653,50026,40280,4684,4558,79507,7591,23827,978,1880,3900,308,59858,264,6502,294,81979,6299,1744,3625,274,4558,4978,11,3154,519,13510,1744,4502,1208,348,20243,299,1082,653,48449,3675,11,45602,44521,1339,24560,4684,76366,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,294,6,14283,5636,78060,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,58673,15610,7010,653,50026,40280,18003,2428,1880,653,4635,84,13,27058,45602,11,4864,69152,653,2307,71,56771,294,39982,978,5185,324,1744,9189,4635,2852,53070,26725,514,272,5976,2933,2854,467,13,19421,665,54008,1291,11,56321,32118,4919,2191,288,13,2009,21134,11,272,17771,1208,5457,409,1208,426,292,799,13,445,1105,593,4864,7591,52274,583,285,1647,4046,73085,409,100007,11,4864,66517,934,35329,665,20272,653,40126,294,6,28400,1771,69125,1744,4864,66517,409,85722,5636,6033,40970,95103,288,13,4366,346,1744,4864,3625,16796,20272,19227,1001,409,37291,1744,4864,3625,16796,917,6091,13,2009,26633,90272,11,272,17771,326,31769,45317,648,294,31769,64374,17108,31037,13,622,6,4202,2852,18757,46524,653,49348,3197,5019,61158,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,11,1370,51173,11,665,864,52985,4538,99077,665,4799,275,11,6033,14707,665,312,45019,4538,99077,11,10071,22299,48488,409,47104,13,14465,14425,13532,11,4864,35456,82,1208,6425,1208,5636,8795,2852,5048,13,2009,8348,13532,25253,11,272,17771,1208,3197,2461,18003,2428,13,2009,38900,1826,665,6926,51913,3294,1880,4046,12821,361,15878,272,24201,13,27058,1131,7867,1438,11,1120,1133,11,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,757,61158,301,13,14465,91507,2961,5615,466,7643,3197,2461,1880,296,6,1138,5615,466,39015,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,315,279,586,5178,11,358,1053,15806,279,8982,439,11263,1473,9,9,59742,84,300,13071,68063,578,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,1375,15436,10507,323,24291,552,311,41468,872,3585,13,2435,1005,48929,12823,311,16988,279,10877,323,1304,6485,19476,810,15987,13,578,19114,596,33811,374,47999,11,323,814,3493,14509,10507,311,1862,872,6105,382,9,9,10793,68063,220,19,320,412,315,220,20,340,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,4832,5573,374,430,1070,527,1063,9099,4819,449,83240,323,32373,304,3738,14491,13,4452,11,8244,11,279,8982,374,1664,12,52243,11,23387,11,323,13750,390,50369,279,19114,596,1984,13,128009],"total_duration":5362324921,"load_duration":210202,"prompt_eval_count":729,"prompt_eval_duration":1365681000,"eval_count":135,"eval_duration":3995844000}
