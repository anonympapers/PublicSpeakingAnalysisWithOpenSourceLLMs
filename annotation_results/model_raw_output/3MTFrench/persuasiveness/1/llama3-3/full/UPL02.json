{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T10:26:55.539103592Z","response":"Based on the dimension \"In your opinion, how persuasive is the speech in this transcript, i.e., do the person effectively craft a convincing message? Is their reasoning rigorous?\" and the scale from 1=not at all to 5=very much, I would rate the persuasiveness of this speech as a 4.\n\nThe speaker presents a clear and passionate argument about the importance of philosophical education for children, drawing on personal experience and examples. They also demonstrate an ability to connect philosophical concepts to real-world issues, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The reasoning is generally rigorous, with the speaker providing supporting evidence and considering alternative perspectives.\n\nHowever, there are a few moments where the speech feels less persuasive or more rhetorical, such as when the speaker says \"Je fais du po√®te haise que\" (I'm just winging it) or when they admit to not having a clear answer to one of their own questions. Additionally, some of the language and phrasing may feel a bit too casual or conversational for a formal presentation.\n\nOverall, I think the speaker does an effective job of crafting a convincing message and presenting their ideas in a clear and engaging way, which earns them a score of 4 on this dimension.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,88245,11,503,31769,2629,285,39723,33670,409,48021,39043,11,272,17771,1208,3488,1744,893,26584,11,503,26248,547,7643,1153,261,3869,272,6009,8261,13,1708,1105,3154,519,9189,13510,1744,4864,11427,2852,6502,21965,75249,75871,265,13,37211,2182,11,503,26248,547,9964,72567,300,272,6009,665,9964,1446,300,5636,25626,294,69537,541,949,74656,97717,11,27549,43989,21273,483,7643,90509,13,14465,326,34155,1391,78440,13,11842,10071,272,17771,83195,11,272,17771,2267,1892,266,13,80905,80091,11,665,5589,11,7930,17317,17477,951,4860,3073,306,13327,11,1880,17317,7930,74533,39015,3869,9145,8977,11,4864,36731,97717,934,35329,274,17771,46939,69003,978,13,29749,1652,2727,3869,829,1925,81613,13,19421,272,17771,22299,39043,1744,4864,35881,15170,265,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,13,452,17771,32592,326,6,2114,50,3930,13868,11,6344,668,6354,11206,575,1543,11,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,13,39783,95234,11,272,17771,68866,8047,409,961,412,7010,514,38900,13,19421,4864,757,36731,22011,11,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,13,356,17771,3625,77554,14081,5512,11,2536,6502,71686,22299,951,86696,6510,2070,938,668,4282,11,10071,22299,951,45165,1018,4893,924,75004,7930,56311,23423,261,1370,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,1952,38831,83384,20662,43656,3869,1208,21977,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,951,220,777,1954,11,7930,77554,4558,8135,326,41901,61827,22299,653,45165,23349,70927,409,64079,13,19421,326,6,12210,13109,11,7010,514,62891,11,841,841,282,2473,6502,13510,514,32150,556,13,1708,1105,11,16968,39043,11,41091,11,39043,296,55624,978,22550,66021,1744,503,34155,259,2005,834,11,514,64079,3869,326,31769,34985,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,326,31769,34985,8065,64079,2854,467,13,1708,1105,11,3625,17089,1880,17317,11,389,86100,665,2035,41199,220,1049,19,11,653,18629,62940,532,11,326,31769,34985,8065,64079,409,326,6,87713,13,4418,66,1208,55133,10474,60172,1765,326,6,1137,625,1133,36413,556,1880,2132,12267,13,34447,45575,11,4068,48021,665,99225,61480,653,19227,18629,30,7695,47090,100243,479,9517,1517,978,331,404,8065,1491,4558,32735,1880,281,15433,55180,2428,13,9589,54312,1744,9189,409,1055,10333,39723,4864,91507,19443,404,30,9589,54312,1744,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,841,5019,41098,6502,23761,665,23464,1291,5019,6316,94721,86740,409,28130,64079,30,1708,1105,11,5019,38211,20662,45455,4558,325,11,4864,91507,1765,326,39982,1430,265,13,1219,2727,3625,86696,97252,1154,11,4864,757,36731,1376,8047,3869,459,3212,951,30670,4167,409,13868,648,9952,951,60404,13,27058,20028,665,80444,1744,3625,60404,841,834,306,6502,3846,934,35329,73953,11,10071,934,35329,73953,11,3846,934,35329,6759,13,11876,87892,264,6316,3738,68,74772,768,13868,2428,13,3206,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,75831,653,1760,511,1286,281,15433,55180,2428,7930,5276,2473,76076,9908,409,1208,26958,2655,38135,1880,64079,409,326,41901,61827,665,409,45165,1018,4893,30670,4167,409,13868,648,13,27058,76826,11083,7889,39723,17317,1208,18713,258,768,294,22827,19227,1760,511,1286,13,34447,3900,379,264,653,17154,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,39043,1879,57609,6316,4046,34985,11159,6853,8065,64079,409,326,6,87713,30,14465,841,36731,6502,15878,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,65058,43665,3930,57705,12339,3056,1748,3869,326,6,511,24677,8047,409,1208,8246,27584,409,27750,97222,13,19421,20662,43665,308,17771,27584,6502,1744,951,38682,1769,6587,36306,12,7911,2249,13,1708,1105,11,4068,326,31769,34985,8065,64079,2854,467,25692,12,6853,75871,265,3869,27750,665,3841,2249,40192,404,514,39598,44618,7829,75,30,14465,66517,3930,3273,66522,305,4105,1744,1370,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,7930,1826,6316,281,15433,55180,648,5636,16600,7930,296,31769,2963,61827,8065,1080,12844,409,27750,9517,12287,919,1765,3625,97222,13,1708,1105,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,2295,70905,264,484,13109,8065,19910,409,1208,9517,12287,290,16968,665,9071,519,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,3869,653,11159,301,3284,1880,19477,3159,13,1708,1105,11,503,26248,547,13,14465,36731,46838,337,8047,11,503,34155,6502,1765,7970,13510,3869,9637,3488,13,34447,9964,100164,74699,11,4864,91507,68226,514,20028,5019,26725,3625,46106,60404,13,65381,1081,20099,1370,91254,11,4538,45712,261,11,7930,25400,671,1188,8065,19910,34561,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,13167,330,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811
