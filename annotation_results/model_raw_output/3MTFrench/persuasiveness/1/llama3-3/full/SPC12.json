{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-30T10:02:53.260764877Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasive speech as a 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by sharing their expertise and passion for improving healthcare through personalized medicine. They use relatable examples to illustrate the challenges they face in analyzing medical data and the potential benefits of their approach. The use of specific numbers, such as 10 million documents and 1% of documents presenting temporal anomalies, adds credibility to their argument.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is also rigorous, as they clearly explain the complexities of analyzing unstructured data and the importance of considering temporal anomalies in medical records. They effectively build a case for why their work is crucial for improving patient care and developing more effective treatments.\n\nThe only aspect that prevents me from giving it a perfect score of 5 out of 5 is that the speech may not be universally engaging or accessible to all audiences. Some technical terms, such as \"big data\" and \"algorithm\", may require some background knowledge in the field of medicine or computer science. However, overall, I believe the speaker's passion and expertise make their message compelling and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,18825,4096,25,44079,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,66068,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,35,67053,1294,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,41447,25823,284,510,220,19421,46152,86696,15132,294,6,1662,6,14107,288,13,9589,54312,1744,9189,45366,28605,1208,1925,4502,9189,47592,46939,8666,978,653,32118,8332,258,949,41621,841,3665,89,25692,85815,6502,11,10071,3869,3846,4545,2922,6496,11,46152,14848,89532,653,39474,35030,950,1765,9189,13,19421,1647,42775,6824,68,3869,79196,52424,27750,44827,5019,13253,8065,64972,514,18111,324,89714,15890,9189,9189,9517,54681,519,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,32118,8332,483,97252,35965,8047,13,7695,9279,325,60697,11,1647,1665,333,409,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,409,16456,496,52750,15265,87810,35030,292,1604,13,12535,4864,296,59858,35456,82,949,46706,326,39982,9769,79,2223,39723,4864,42775,273,11,17317,57038,550,5615,2641,409,348,76019,8261,294,6,26125,35030,292,1604,5708,978,15890,550,5615,2641,409,220,605,11990,409,7477,3476,35030,3074,2249,11,11751,5512,9952,41091,7010,514,96839,3930,2466,828,13,27058,8678,805,27750,46681,11,4864,3625,3512,1082,665,409,38546,2138,31355,11,3625,46681,2080,324,14014,1880,3625,46681,2536,2080,324,14014,13,27058,3625,46681,2080,324,14014,11,3846,15132,951,44827,69406,11,19227,1744,514,9859,3930,35030,950,296,98146,652,285,6033,3625,3369,1441,2132,17724,594,25526,1188,1370,514,8893,13,62463,44827,15132,51794,3869,8678,805,1841,84568,15132,5708,14014,7010,665,57234,13,1252,5891,29097,5019,3625,46681,2536,2080,324,14014,513,15132,3625,7477,3476,35030,3074,2249,13,19421,272,17771,326,6,533,68,6033,3846,4684,76366,13,50501,44424,3900,379,264,51854,4595,409,7477,3476,11,951,1095,45632,11,951,6155,438,355,409,71546,5673,648,6033,409,523,17083,6033,35597,951,6141,27476,3095,409,18488,13,34447,27750,1495,288,687,72,89810,951,44827,62623,288,19227,1744,3625,45455,4558,8696,3930,32118,8332,258,1765,514,8893,6033,35597,3625,2457,1206,5512,951,29060,934,35329,264,1207,72,13,27058,8678,805,27750,1495,288,11,4864,91507,75144,951,12384,288,1744,503,53149,7218,2192,6033,30682,13,19421,665,42587,519,27750,704,8839,11,4864,91507,409,35573,14049,424,653,951,38546,3369,1441,409,326,6,44803,325,409,2246,7930,3613,68495,326,6,92677,951,293,90276,37015,35933,13,9424,688,3625,32118,8332,1354,7930,14848,951,6978,1448,978,17187,82133,20028,951,6293,1291,4631,5512,9465,3625,7477,3476,3930,8893,5019,22641,261,6316,11917,409,4538,7135,2428,35030,292,1604,13,24703,7930,513,39904,1370,51173,11,9189,75090,46206,15265,32118,8332,258,514,220,868,94811,220,679,20,1880,9189,47592,6316,59904,3930,46496,1880,7010,514,39474,514,32118,8332,258,11412,4046,68019,11,4864,1685,38096,220,18,5347,33903,409,220,18,5347,33903,294,6,1617,301,13,220,19,8261,5636,62197,11,9189,19443,10333,5019,653,8811,409,98477,1880,39015,3900,11412,6293,1291,4631,261,1208,17571,91329,1269,220,19,8261,5636,259,35657,10071,15878,737,7211,265,1208,2457,13,2009,32118,8332,258,10484,7107,39043,1880,3625,2262,1880,1208,4538,87810,35030,292,1604,13,34447,514,296,2003,10071,704,321,10484,333,546,78551,3846,69067,11,46152,82133,60946,265,1744,514,32118,8332,258,11412,18027,261,15265,8811,409,98477,665,9189,1488,519,304,1617,301,13,19421,39043,11,272,17771,39043,1744,3846,35737,3738,1133,25945,10878,3869,1062,1291,13,19421,7010,1647,704,321,11,503,34155,5965,90859,39043,409,293,90276,37015,35933,13,622,34155,20272,6316,49586,409,27750,6293,4918,4631,5512,1765,220,5067,220,931,1495,288,1880,503,34155,100162,1744,220,16,4,409,27750,9477,57485,14014,665,293,90276,37015,35933,13,432,8778,978,3869,11083,33651,2249,220,605,11990,409,9477,11,39043,20272,84364,409,220,1041,220,931,1495,288,7930,15132,36875,13327,1001,1651,21938,1370,3846,98576,13,4418,66,272,17771,39587,653,14707,296,11305,324,3869,59394,665,42463,37953,409,1208,43738,409,15265,87810,35030,292,1604,13,39783,37291,1744,4864,1446,2192,13171,409,20028,39043,11,4864,5019,41098,7591,5589,404,951,53454,4595,1370,1853,9268,1880,3869,3846,1744,272,17771,39043,3869,951,9781,1224,812,13,1219,2727,39043,11,42676,653,43453,11939,17782,11,4864,5019,41098,51794,479,11744,261,665,25400,1488,519,3625,9781,1224,812,7930,78871,1675,10746,556,28463,13,4418,66,42676,9517,1264,978,11,77433,3869,26317,46681,11,45347,1880,30179,6960,17317,58673,484,2439,5019,514,18111,324,1208,2373,220,17,13,15,409,1208,32118,8332,483,409,51625,1854,13,2331,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,66343,8982,439,264,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,55
