The speaker discusses how animals in warm climates tend to be smaller than those in cooler climates, citing examples such as polar bears and hummingbirds. They also mention the concept of Bergman's rule, which states that larger animals are better adapted to cold climates than smaller ones.\n\nThe speaker then moves on to discuss the idea that animals may adapt to changing climate conditions by changing their size or behavior. They use a dataset of bird populations in France to illustrate this point, suggesting that some species may experience changes in their body size in response to climate fluctuations.\n\nÉCHELLE: This is an evaluation scale ranging from 1 (not at all persuasive) to 5 (very persuasive).\n\nDIMENSION: The dimension being evaluated is the persuasiveness of the discourse. Is the speaker's argument convincing and well-supported by evidence?\n\nTÂCHE: Based on this transcript, I would give a score of **4** out of 5 for persuasiveness. The speaker presents some interesting examples and concepts, such as Bergman's rule, to support their argument about animal size and climate change. They also use a dataset to illustrate their point, which adds credibility to their claims. However, the speech could be improved by providing more specific evidence or statistics to support the idea that animals are actually adapting to changing climate conditions by changing their size or behavior. Additionally, some of the language used is somewhat informal and may not be as effective at persuading a skeptical audience. Overall, the speaker makes a compelling case, but could benefit from further refinement and development of their argument.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,9880,11,389,84228,447,1339,1744,39015,39723,3900,20272,70412,11,653,10065,39015,3122,1826,71151,40970,25500,11,71151,46206,3625,102878,1394,12249,6033,35597,46206,3625,36041,333,31539,11,864,55506,1474,5615,9004,1370,51173,653,4411,346,25685,13,66090,4502,1826,5636,25500,1744,4538,36271,665,8811,329,648,11,39043,272,17771,653,51173,11741,23034,10071,39043,15572,68,49733,11,653,85059,98477,97262,321,11,39723,3900,20272,653,46110,41675,11,35737,40970,25500,1744,4538,8941,9859,321,379,264,409,1208,16578,13,24703,308,17771,6502,6316,3190,24812,409,27389,7611,45973,3625,924,846,324,285,1880,1208,83229,3491,409,31782,1543,11,665,6160,41632,3257,2428,11,3900,22011,1744,3625,94527,22641,306,64972,1208,523,61047,1744,3625,86696,13,4418,66,11,3900,20272,70412,1744,9964,1560,21965,25500,13535,44618,6316,17508,5098,648,13,622,41901,16796,20272,326,6,4683,65679,11,259,1188,6502,5636,62197,934,39982,1291,11,7643,259,13559,409,4865,11,58482,88684,8065,3116,67,2428,11,514,83457,1744,1208,4865,9314,12339,13,4418,66,11,951,4046,19926,4751,8467,11,39015,4864,9189,1370,273,409,64441,11,10071,3900,29253,28463,951,2144,38647,6160,1640,8467,11,7010,514,48734,11,42676,326,77492,3460,11,3900,20272,653,13091,285,19266,85,12339,13,7695,379,264,5636,294,22827,4315,978,11,39587,9964,757,1759,665,305,1553,11,10071,4502,9964,1560,5636,6800,11,9964,439,5636,409,31807,13583,11,25692,85815,1744,1208,9964,7550,648,8941,34922,1880,9964,841,100164,409,1028,78548,13,1611,326,31769,447,11067,5553,3625,17258,645,11,4502,503,34155,14707,13550,285,11,272,17771,326,98279,12214,1291,6155,57332,1880,274,35329,20272,282,47789,361,6800,1773,978,13,34447,5019,934,35329,379,264,653,274,15433,5898,11,4864,9189,1370,273,409,39043,75804,88253,13,14465,9189,1370,273,294,31109,1206,978,1474,373,11,10071,76776,409,2798,14081,1598,13,41621,3665,89,25692,85815,1744,514,1206,978,1474,1815,12,853,1826,1744,3625,27138,15132,10878,1744,20272,1208,56594,1986,13109,2267,355,751,11843,57733,11323,266,2428,11,1880,14707,39043,7591,3825,1339,15907,16948,4558,1634,1370,86633,272,17771,13859,266,2428,13,39783,3488,5019,23589,265,4068,46524,3930,282,1607,13,4418,66,11,30870,713,2439,5553,514,48734,11,39043,35737,40970,70412,39015,1481,300,13,19421,4502,1208,55133,951,9517,23475,2609,14014,409,2035,11,1208,56594,1986,13109,9517,23475,665,2349,519,7010,326,77025,1330,11,10071,4068,4864,66517,949,12095,4864,841,94297,6502,30870,1414,13,29749,308,6,300,934,81991,7591,5531,978,6316,9637,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,11,1208,296,2227,354,11,1370,51173,11,66517,1355,57288,21901,96308,13,2009,92942,523,13559,2231,569,7010,326,6,48029,4618,5019,523,3376,951,296,4618,2922,6496,13,19421,272,17771,1208,26633,90272,951,9517,23475,8065,9517,76179,1133,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,9517,23475,665,2349,519,7010,514,27138,13,14465,94297,14707,13510,514,85059,2427,6809,10071,13510,653,490,1791,7930,296,6,73,26248,547,13,11583,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,11,40574,525,1880,294,41901,83791,48099,11,665,5636,11,7643,47276,11,1647,39646,1826,49733,13,64105,64,841,87264,6502,5636,4382,4502,503,31769,2629,285,70374,5636,46110,13,19421,4502,1208,8348,13532,25253,951,9517,23475,513,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,11,1208,56594,1986,13109,9517,23475,7010,326,31769,49938,519,4046,39624,99188,11,1880,272,17771,3846,1765,75249,5019,1028,48021,3869,15265,38317,13,1952,829,275,74699,1744,11323,266,1826,1208,62827,11,4538,409,296,4558,1557,11,10071,4502,514,1206,978,1474,1815,12,853,7010,514,27138,13,11876,4039,12249,82133,12,8839,62439,409,62827,5019,3154,519,30,27058,514,47929,11,503,49963,1082,653,51655,409,46681,38883,13,11876,3122,98733,17724,7930,757,1759,77065,951,297,1082,12249,7010,43905,1208,9822,13,11246,92759,519,11,272,17771,57375,3460,409,46110,1880,6800,11,10071,5019,1208,56594,1986,13109,3930,46415,665,75249,272,17771,3062,30,19421,14707,11,665,272,17771,27138,409,25626,23851,11323,266,2428,11,1208,62827,11412,62439,26725,3625,4121,2439,4046,39624,10515,8467,13,46408,326,26248,20272,11,1208,7550,648,11,951,16948,4558,1634,1765,10335,265,11,39043,25692,27584,62439,9637,2035,7010,1208,13826,25108,818,682,648,1647,88026,13,5034,24408,294,54386,1826,3869,1208,62827,11,272,17771,62891,27138,11,27549,20605,68,1880,272,3433,10333,326,93847,11,6502,1208,62827,11,39043,42463,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,
