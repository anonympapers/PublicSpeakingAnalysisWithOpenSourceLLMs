{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-28T20:23:18.228674335Z","response":"Based on the transcription, I would rate the degree of persuasion as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is mostly rigorous and logical, using examples and experiences to support their arguments. They also use persuasive language, such as emphasizing the benefits of their approach (\"pour plus d'indépendance\") and acknowledging potential criticisms (\"mais les écart, entre eux, ne sont pas de trop\"). The tone is generally confident and assertive, which adds to the overall persuasiveness of the message.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give it a perfect score (5 out of 5) because the language is sometimes informal and conversational, which might not be as effective in convincing all listeners. Additionally, some of the arguments are somewhat general and could be challenged or refined further. Nevertheless, overall, the speaker presents their ideas in a clear and compelling way that should persuade most listeners.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,43989,6316,37291,7010,653,938,7911,3972,78060,11,653,490,17194,369,1414,263,7930,80664,1339,11,653,3738,13,24703,46496,45325,665,67781,43989,14707,991,7005,635,11,3900,841,1370,1055,10333,6502,6316,51651,60128,13,350,5612,3625,70477,1634,934,35329,57728,64,1188,11,348,1082,11,1841,326,6,4134,11,665,1099,263,425,11,43989,16968,2098,355,978,1880,308,6,285,12,6496,2922,22827,951,10405,13,356,96287,4538,294,2182,1208,2267,1088,79380,19576,13,39783,14240,2070,100243,7930,513,20272,665,1097,546,11,514,36252,278,7930,57728,1339,14240,519,296,714,11,272,17771,4631,4558,38768,11,8791,458,13,2057,72,4160,321,6496,665,293,49530,8047,11,20272,39587,76190,3869,17317,7930,264,1860,2159,951,12933,71269,689,1001,27389,85,355,5019,951,1367,28154,2436,35018,13,2998,1296,519,665,270,316,10515,278,11,9964,5019,13075,274,98146,40973,7970,3125,8941,83597,11,326,31769,339,20243,307,7246,13,32757,15760,3869,8941,294,6,89626,372,519,11,514,369,1414,263,513,53534,11,1880,2343,64,8065,38847,12108,3625,7177,409,71748,762,283,3869,13,34447,514,369,1414,263,22011,3869,64160,17274,11,4864,5320,2249,20028,11083,4043,2852,1765,3577,67965,6853,11,7033,4558,325,1880,1744,4864,94297,9952,326,55624,8677,7684,2058,1208,1028,68249,5019,5636,294,6,485,978,3825,685,13,356,17771,1744,503,6,1138,535,9952,11083,54063,11,220,1049,296,75104,294,93847,8065,27584,65285,266,1744,11083,7251,556,8065,10278,354,11,45602,296,6,306,969,324,1339,1744,4864,326,34155,3284,4502,326,54386,757,361,11,294,94572,15273,513,39904,2442,84,409,70375,409,1296,409,834,15138,66014,3930,42630,84,13,7695,1798,64,39015,1765,27750,54063,11,653,2107,668,324,10737,978,5019,757,503,7889,8065,64972,3625,9045,68866,5512,13,19421,9952,56321,72475,1765,326,6,412,48164,348,1056,1339,11,272,17771,1208,7591,1659,7930,1208,5636,84921,1339,13,7695,1367,14081,3904,64,27750,54063,1765,94616,5512,1765,26633,220,1041,21737,288,35881,13649,14014,7010,1208,274,1291,13,2009,1296,274,31769,1191,77,1339,4382,11,10071,6502,15858,17194,11,4046,5192,300,6853,1880,21737,288,9465,26633,12235,12249,41380,13,2009,369,1414,263,26483,6723,77433,3869,20662,88411,11,3625,1719,75104,3930,83597,8791,458,3869,829,8198,13,435,2381,514,12646,283,1880,3625,70477,1634,2536,26965,288,11,40744,27750,47590,97958,665,5589,8065,48734,13,34447,9465,27138,11,27750,4631,4558,70,1157,11,46152,60796,1188,43153,4043,2852,13,19421,294,81979,1719,75104,11,4864,38831,15170,2852,9952,94499,11,10071,5019,514,27584,5634,28154,2933,11,5019,514,27584,83597,11,3869,45602,841,513,25692,934,35329,1826,514,5636,33204,51453,13,24703,4631,4558,38768,3930,326,6,9011,21152,11,272,17771,42676,27584,28130,30870,9363,11,10071,3625,4046,51808,11,9465,84440,11,841,15132,6502,409,21965,11,9952,45889,9045,1880,45889,65838,13,1252,9880,11,3355,61799,514,27138,39723,16968,35737,9517,6200,978,13,2009,369,1414,263,31736,285,39587,8792,11,1880,3900,348,1339,934,31109,77818,817,1880,84871,409,86696,10896,1900,13,2998,5589,1131,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,46940,11,358,1053,4478,279,8547,315,98224,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,596,33811,374,10213,47999,323,20406,11,1701,10507,323,11704,311,1862,872,6105,13,2435,1101,1005,66343,4221,11,1778,439,82003,279,7720,315,872,5603,3573,55619,5636,294,6,485,978,3825,685,909,323,61708,4754,63836,3573,1764,285,3625,4046,11707,11,9465,84440,11,841,15132,6502,409,21965,1865,578,16630,374,8965,16913,323,2105,535,11,902,11621,311,279,8244,24613,300,13071,315,279,1984,627,198,11458,11,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,4832,5573,320,20,704,315,220,20,8,1606,279,4221,374,7170,42887,323,7669,1697,11,902,2643,539,387,439,7524,304,40661,682,24475,13,23212,11,1063,315,279,6105,527,14738,4689,323,1436,387,29991,477,38291,4726,13,35053,11,8244,11,279,19114,18911,872,6848,304,264,2867,323,29722,1648,430,1288,51041,1455,24475,13,128009],"total_duration":106043026010,"load_duration":145400,"prompt_eval_count":787,"prompt_eval_duration":80970359000,"eval_count":181,"eval_duration":25072070000}
