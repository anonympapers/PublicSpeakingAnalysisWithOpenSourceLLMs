The announcements from commercial agencies are not to be extrapolated; many fantasies materialize. Attention, minorities are not far away; Big Brother is self-autorizing. Some people are for generalized surveillance, while others, united by their sequencer, disappear into the sectioned networks of objective cables through which the World Wide Web transits and seeks to protect humanity from a well-observed evil. If I'm sure that several of you see what I mean about what I want to talk about.\n\nToday, when we refer to Big Data in the police, we imagine an intelligent application capable of detecting criminality or deciphering the mysteries of our own obsessions. We know that some years ago, we discovered that this superintelligence can filter out strategic creations for taking the leadership of our blue planet. I present, but it is necessary to note that we are 1,000 leagues away from global intelligence whose functioning would be perfectly numberless.\n\nIn France, the national police force has no solution at its disposal. It seems that in the exagone, even Big Brother would be forced to render accounts if personal data were analyzed. But I'm not hiding it; police officers have access to a multitude of exploited data. Data are becoming more and more voluminous and therefore difficult to treat by human procedures. Imagine the city of Paris with over 15,000 public cameras. It is useful to think that an team, even composed of 100 people, could not achieve effective surveillance of images transmitted in real-time. And that's why automation is increasingly questioned for treating certain massive data. To detect the presence of abandoned vehicles or generate alerts when groups of individuals are approaching. And even if it's not the first thing that comes to mind, this automation is likely to have an impact on the police officer on the ground.\n\nBecause until recently, this police officer relied solely on his intuition to decide. For example, to identify a stolen vehicle, he noticed the presence of a poorly fixed license plate or suspicious behavior from the driver and passengers. That little detail that leads to the flash of genius. And before, it was systems automatics coupled with video protection networks that allowed him to detect a problem and notify the same police officer on the ground. It generates an alert when a vehicle signals evolves and is identified. And we, our goal is to determine if in this universe where data analysis reigns, the intuition of our old-fashioned cop can still express itself.\n\nÉCHELLE = [Scale from 1=not at all persuasive to 5=very persuasive.]\n\nDIMENSION = [Your opinion: What is the degree of persuasion of the discourse in this transcription, i.e., does the person effectively write a convincing message?
