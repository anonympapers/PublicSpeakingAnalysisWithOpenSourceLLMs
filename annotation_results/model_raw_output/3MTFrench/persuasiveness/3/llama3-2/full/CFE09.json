However, they are not talking about the release of a new oil team season of Game of Thrones. Instead, they want to talk about another type of war that takes place in your body, specifically in your intestines, when you are infected with toxic bacteria.\n\nThe speaker uses the example of Game of Thrones to explain the concept of two worlds: one where the White Walkers are present and one where civilization is present. The two worlds are separated by a massive wall to protect civilization. Similarly, in your body, there are two worlds: the world of good bacteria and the world of toxic bacteria.\n\nThe speaker explains that when the toxic bacteria arrive at the level of your intestinal barrier, they stick and start causing symptoms such as bloating and pain. The bacteria also produce small soldiers called toxins that can cross the barrier into your bloodstream. Once in your blood, these toxins can cause a range of problems including digestive issues, skin rashes, and even neurological problems.\n\nThe speaker introduces the concept of nitric oxide (NO), which is produced by your immune system to fight off infections. They explain that NO is like the guard who protects the wall, able to kill off toxic bacteria but not enough to eliminate them completely.\n\nThe speaker concludes by saying that they have been studying how NO works on toxic bacteria and toxins in the intestines, as well as how these bacteria resist NO. They promise to share their findings with the audience in a few months.\n\n**ÉCHELLE**\n\n1=pas du tout persuasif à 5=très persuasif\n\n**DIMENSION**\n\nLa dimension de persuasion est la capacité du discours à convaincre l'auditoire de son argumentation. Dans cette transcription, le discours utilise des exemples concrets et des analogies (comparaison entre les deux mondes de Game of Thrones et les deux mondes dans votre corps) pour expliquer un concept complexe. Le discours est également bien structure et facile à suivre.\n\n**TÂCHE**\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nLa raison pour laquelle je donne un score relativement élevé est que le discours utilise des stratégies persuasives efficaces, telles que les analogies et les exemples concrets. Cependant, il y a quelques moments où le discours peut être difficile à suivre ou trop technique pour certains auditeurs.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,12095,4864,9189,834,3869,436,321,220,679,24,11,9189,73953,89,3869,75249,949,41621,12584,89,757,13510,3625,297,1082,12249,88587,11,3625,88587,1344,10612,11,272,17771,514,1194,336,1725,11,1880,14707,41091,4864,9189,75871,11,6033,958,81,5014,22299,6892,13,14465,1370,273,14707,1765,409,1208,84143,409,326,6,17156,458,2128,80091,409,1208,47528,4140,315,47494,13,1708,1105,4864,436,395,554,16968,409,16578,3625,7359,1880,3625,296,41901,8571,11,4864,841,91507,6502,9189,15473,444,466,3846,7930,11412,513,45347,13,11842,11,4502,4864,36731,39015,3846,57992,11,272,17771,5019,9189,89504,294,22827,47838,955,409,1709,67100,13,39783,293,460,4618,7930,264,39381,7010,15265,34922,11,5636,51625,285,42625,7010,15265,39408,258,11,87158,9189,62299,5310,547,3930,308,41901,41569,2428,3869,326,6,3904,12844,13,2009,32118,11943,665,20662,87810,11,272,17771,1208,293,533,35285,4046,331,301,978,46777,297,398,325,665,666,56771,71,17060,269,351,2428,13,46408,25692,23761,30179,6960,7010,514,387,1739,3869,46206,6033,3625,54021,8065,326,20243,583,1557,11,1880,514,80259,272,17771,1744,1208,31547,942,274,6,768,625,5048,409,326,49152,290,409,326,6,3518,768,409,293,2352,8082,3930,326,4558,49606,11,841,29557,61512,409,1208,259,8977,33670,934,80720,513,38831,83384,7010,15265,1645,66522,13,39783,37291,34527,8047,11,15265,39408,258,513,5276,68,665,45165,23349,35641,293,460,4618,13,27058,14707,60946,265,4068,39043,513,39904,11,19443,2439,3869,4140,315,47494,13,46706,1208,47528,11,3900,379,264,26633,1647,5919,13,445,22827,28800,40852,77422,1370,3625,32118,99906,348,613,269,2067,1821,11,326,49455,265,1370,1208,8431,8082,13,2009,16968,19266,1768,978,1370,653,23401,15844,593,64972,5019,1760,978,1414,1208,8431,8082,13,46706,15265,2942,44618,11,272,17771,514,27584,82660,3527,13,1219,2727,3625,15572,2914,64347,82,7930,3057,331,306,3930,8309,5019,1208,294,6,582,447,1082,11,3625,293,533,35285,69003,306,8065,53052,409,1208,3703,68028,15265,39408,258,1880,4502,1046,299,1557,13,356,17771,3846,7930,11412,2605,78,16339,3625,78199,409,10594,265,13,393,556,11,3625,293,533,35285,9765,462,14295,409,86696,6216,1900,2107,4893,409,30517,261,514,8309,513,15132,3625,41569,1572,13,39783,37291,1208,3703,68028,39408,258,1604,16953,648,11,272,17771,41569,483,513,38831,83384,7010,514,29340,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,1208,46131,55342,1604,5019,23761,665,1375,5512,1262,2194,13,423,458,407,11,326,31769,11588,68,1880,514,272,5976,2933,5019,2605,78,16339,1672,1386,285,1821,126535,3458,645,1880,21965,514,18247,25205,13,34447,6502,409,7363,2428,13,2009,8309,1826,1760,19395,978,1370,951,22641,288,13,46706,15265,2942,44618,11,272,17771,514,72601,4998,3928,12267,7930,264,3846,436,57332,409,6144,12844,13,445,1105,447,35329,85877,440,68,1208,30179,768,951,293,533,118904,552,1880,951,41569,1572,7010,326,6,43114,258,11,3900,54206,51854,22337,20243,2482,5019,326,6339,45973,326,52152,13421,13,445,31109,294,6,37907,274,53149,6853,514,1647,55189,294,6,1394,1295,13,1952,92215,514,93455,8065,7515,451,7930,1760,73899,514,8309,11,46152,15132,2107,4893,409,259,8977,3625,15572,2914,64347,82,11,10071,6502,79380,31914,2492,5019,26725,3625,4046,4763,1572,13,1708,1105,5019,23761,57375,11,46152,1370,10176,89810,4502,951,5636,1317,82,293,1116,288,13,1611,1208,27584,76407,11,389,829,275,1744,514,1647,55189,294,6,1394,1295,9517,47348,514,9859,409,293,533,118904,552,1880,409,41569,483,7010,326,6,43114,258,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,8657,285,519,5019,6316,43116,258,13421,13,24703,87264,57375,3284,39587,294,49963,12329,20662,22337,978,3395,375,22299,89714,13,356,17771,1120,1133,1208,3488,3869,1208,88265,4864,52571,1208,9517,76701,9952,7643,83067,13,27058,45602,11,503,34155,14240,664,648,4068,514,1647,55189,294,6,1394,1295,945,15760,1765,3625,293,533,118904,552,1880,3625,41569,1572,7010,326,6,43114,258,13,19421,3869,326,52152,4550,11,514,296,1339,978,676,8065,32118,4919,44618,42587,978,1370,1208,293,533,978,64519,5019,31807,1601,514,1647,55189,294,6,1394,1295,13,1708,1105,4502,4068,9189,62299,74797,409,47929,4502,1208,8431,8082,35737,33254,588,4618,6033,4502,514,1647,55189,294,6,1394,1295,92215,23761,42587,978,22299,89714,11,66651,45325,7010,45889,46415,3869,1208,1913,409,1208,80091,6033,96308,3869,1208,1913,409,7643,83067,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,26
