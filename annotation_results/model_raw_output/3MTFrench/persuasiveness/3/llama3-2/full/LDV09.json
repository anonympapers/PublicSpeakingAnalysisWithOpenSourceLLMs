The pilot has the responsibility to bring passengers to their destination. Audio communication between the latter and the entire air traffic control, which is currently done through a helmet connected to the meat by a cable. Imagine you're leaving on vacation from Poitiers to go to an island. Whether it's for scuba diving or for your pilot, disconnect the helmet at the moment when the controller informs that another plane is arriving in front of you. The crash into the water and quickly becomes a sea of fish. You'll have to offer and dive, but one dive is not enough. Air travel wants to replace these helmets with wireless ones. You might ask why the airline company chose those helmets from commerce. It's generally requested that you relax or put on your airplane without a wire because it's the last thing for you to perturb the good functioning of the plane. Even if your pilot was equipped, maybe your plane wouldn't have crashed, but the senseless file at the pace that the stop sign and a terrorist among the passengers, with the possibility of worse communication, divert your plane to fly to the North Pole. Difficult for the other, dive under 40 degrees. Mathematics makes it possible to propose a wireless and secure helmet. To achieve this, I experimented with using technology, hide-communication. This is a technology that uses light to transmit information. You don't have to equip the helmet in a pool or risk perturbing the concentration of the pilot. I use invisible light, called a frequency. If you're afraid of what's happening, I saw that at some point, military men will come and take this device away from you for their own use. The authorities are actually with you, we don't see the light, and they're therefore caught off guard. In summary, the use of technology, hide-communication has a double advantage. It doesn't disturb the good functioning of the plane, impossible to pirate communications because it's confined to the interior of the pilot's cabin. I'm currently working with an airplane manufacturer to equip their fleet with this device. For now, we're in the prototyping phase because there are still parameters of security, reliability and quality to find. Thus, one can improve. The pilots will be conforming to the water, while ensuring safety. And you'll be able to ask for a peaceful dive. I have a lot more work left to do, but if you're careful.\n\nÉCHELLE:\n\nPersuasion scale from 1=not at all persuasive to 5=very persuasive.\n\nDIMENSION:\n\nWhat is the degree of persuasion in this transcription, i.e., does the person effectively write a convincing message?
