{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-28T20:15:14.265619952Z","response":"What a fascinating transcription!\n\nAfter analyzing the text, I would rate the persuasiveness of this discourse as **4/5**. Here's why:\n\nThe speaker effectively uses storytelling to engage the audience and make the topic more relatable. The use of anecdotes (e.g., \"rebeurs dans son service à la SNCF\") helps to build a connection with the listener.\n\nThe speaker also uses logical reasoning and concrete examples (e.g., \"un logiciel qui s'y me lève vibration dans la voix ferrée, est notamment dans le balast\") to support their argument. This makes the proposal more convincing and easier to understand.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a point because some parts of the text might seem less relevant or even confusing to someone who is not familiar with the context (e.g., \"rebeurs\" and \"Chuck Simulator\"). Additionally, there are a few places where the language could be clearer or more concise.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents their argument in a clear and engaging manner, making it likely to persuade the audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,452,1105,220,20,13,2009,62891,92020,19266,84270,41958,665,5216,409,1208,9120,11828,361,16578,13,81501,1744,9189,30209,10333,1765,26317,26633,16536,31355,11,389,312,1395,852,11,56445,6316,3388,45973,1208,20605,265,13,2998,56321,76145,11,3900,11412,26564,385,404,44152,829,12602,11,3521,2058,1208,4160,953,9952,653,296,20430,2933,11,665,49564,261,3625,78352,11,16177,89,829,12602,11,3127,52424,1208,4160,953,409,16968,39043,11,33670,514,21134,5542,3930,5634,258,13,12103,30870,9363,3869,312,1395,324,11,272,17771,294,6,44803,805,3625,26467,39723,1208,4160,953,513,7591,7082,5636,409,1744,27389,46790,11,1880,54613,841,829,275,60019,87320,13,19421,97507,11,6316,4160,953,58139,8047,11,272,17771,5636,4684,76366,1744,3846,1744,326,54386,92215,23423,261,13,3341,6316,29465,68,409,5542,1765,653,436,2192,11,3846,15132,84364,409,220,605,52021,11,917,84,648,1765,3625,934,4023,812,294,22827,9392,13,1708,1105,11,3154,519,409,13510,1744,46777,33013,42625,409,1208,4160,953,1826,9406,455,1130,43765,390,79884,13,7695,13550,285,514,9839,561,13,41621,3665,89,20662,4020,1557,409,31245,283,7930,1421,283,49606,1208,628,455,472,951,4160,953,13,19421,5019,61512,11,8811,90966,26725,27750,9045,11,312,1395,1759,7010,4538,2532,3869,1208,18407,9847,1880,76776,4635,84,22299,66090,7930,436,69261,44093,3869,1208,18579,951,60120,13,19421,87320,11,312,1395,1759,86100,409,513,98054,42463,1744,26725,27750,4043,2852,308,26248,25646,15760,259,2850,268,949,2009,1665,333,409,386,988,68,11,272,17771,409,20028,665,80444,1744,312,1395,1759,2961,49530,306,409,15473,10145,13,27058,39043,11,4864,25400,16796,10045,978,34349,53338,11,653,1515,78493,7930,274,59858,757,326,79351,48913,7010,1208,4160,953,58139,8047,11,1826,81186,7010,514,9839,561,13,12103,30870,9363,11,4538,30870,9363,3930,8628,47391,25253,11,312,1395,324,25692,75831,665,45889,22059,14295,13,1252,1206,3972,13053,4088,409,1208,4160,953,1880,76773,978,3625,78352,7010,20662,4160,953,11,16968,22299,274,35329,66517,1339,274,6,434,1155,13,62293,34349,53338,11,312,1395,324,92215,27584,20245,35573,1208,4160,953,3930,18111,324,7930,274,17771,13,507,2005,11,5019,312,1395,1759,11,3846,15132,951,25975,8065,40970,294,97670,543,978,13,27058,4538,30806,11,3846,15132,409,829,1589,1082,82653,2428,13,19421,951,9971,33903,8065,40970,13,27058,61512,11,42676,514,57485,978,39043,11,312,1395,324,3900,308,96287,1744,25945,52138,2734,1133,934,54386,11412,3709,1412,978,13,7695,296,26248,22011,11,272,17771,14707,72006,39043,13,34447,39043,35456,3698,3675,409,27138,3869,7364,1215,30,24703,1744,41091,503,34155,934,22827,26048,294,6,472,11,503,34155,6502,514,2307,5935,11067,409,1208,22146,13,7695,308,49152,1339,6502,1069,324,3846,30806,312,1395,324,13,3341,1208,55133,2373,409,34349,53338,11,259,3514,1339,1765,653,6141,3357,324,3869,220,3101,13988,978,36306,13,1708,1105,3154,519,13510,1744,1765,326,6,8904,324,409,312,1395,324,11,9952,4538,1491,18223,13988,978,11067,11,6316,19576,44521,1339,52579,220,22,46415,13,4418,66,11,4864,36731,2160,3514,978,3869,1647,44402,5019,9517,1072,556,1208,18757,24918,409,45889,63846,17724,13,19421,34349,53338,11,16968,3869,33614,514,9880,13,19421,75144,951,991,76,4558,4978,1880,27584,12384,288,1744,5019,1208,59157,13109,13053,31037,13,27058,20245,35573,653,51655,57146,665,59157,13109,13053,31037,11,389,56445,1370,9129,8977,6316,2385,409,46681,7930,687,1188,40744,3625,9517,23475,2278,21041,409,326,41901,2842,40280,409,51655,13,362,26725,3625,54409,12760,2278,21041,409,326,86509,13,2998,51092,11,20662,2385,409,46681,1826,5714,8047,7010,326,6,8904,324,3930,9880,13,19421,87158,66090,63484,20272,653,54409,7986,11,4538,6141,3357,324,308,26248,934,81991,3698,10670,1208,2385,5019,3460,404,6316,90509,11,934,17771,54312,934,35329,379,264,9888,276,42625,13,19421,14707,5019,34349,53338,11,16968,11,272,17771,1208,27584,14896,13,14465,91507,9129,8977,6316,2385,409,46681,5019,1208,46131,282,52424,13,2998,51092,11,87158,312,1395,324,42775,273,6502,1765,829,4160,953,13053,31037,11,4538,6141,3357,324,308,6,22290,934,81991,3698,10670,1208,2385,5019,3460,404,6316,90509,665,40970,409,220,18,4520,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,389,1370,273,665,220,18,4520,409,9189,1208,74333,13,9605,1208,19576,409,312,1395,324,86100,409,513,10415,261,11,1880,4502,4864,841,91507,6502,3625,7591,9211,11,3900,11412,35597,48908,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557
