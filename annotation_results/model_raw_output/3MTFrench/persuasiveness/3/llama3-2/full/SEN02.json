Here's why:\n\nThe speaker presents their argument in a clear and concise manner, using analogies (e.g., \"compression, torsion, six aimes\" for bone behavior) that make complex concepts more accessible. They also use humor and lighthearted examples (e.g., dancing styles) to engage the audience.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the persuasion could be improved:\n\n1. The speaker's tone is sometimes casual, which might detract from their credibility.\n2. Some of the analogies and metaphors might be too unconventional for some listeners, potentially causing confusion.\n3. The discourse lacks concrete evidence or data to support the claims made about bone dating.\n\nOverall, while the speaker has an engaging style and presents their argument in a creative way, there are areas where they could strengthen their persuasion by adding more substance and structure to their argument.\n\nAs for the dimension \"Rigour du raisonnement,\" I would rate it as 3 out of 5. The speaker's reasoning is generally sound, but some parts feel like they're stretching or using unproven assumptions. For example, the idea that music (acoustics) can be used to date bones seems innovative and intriguing, but its validity hasn't been thoroughly demonstrated in this discourse.\n\nWhat do you
