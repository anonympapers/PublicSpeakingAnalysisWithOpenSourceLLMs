{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-28T21:40:12.841876281Z","response":"**TRANSCRIPTION**: A transcript of a public speech about artificial intelligence, specifically highlighting the importance of human decision-making and flexibility in the face of uncertainty. The speaker uses a relatable scenario (deciding what to do after finishing work) to illustrate how our brains use emotional and rational considerations to make decisions.\n\n**DIMENSION**: Persuasiveness scale from 1-5.\n\n**TÃ‚CHE**: Evaluate the persuasiveness of this public speech.\n\nBased on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of this speech as **4/5**. Here's why:\n\n* The speaker starts with a clever play on words (\"Bonjour et namastez\") and uses humor to break the ice.\n* They use a relatable scenario (deciding what to do after finishing work) to illustrate their point about human decision-making.\n* The speaker effectively highlights the limitations of AI-based decision-making, emphasizing the importance of flexibility and emotional intelligence in real-life situations.\n* The use of analogies (e.g., comparing brain functions to video games) makes complex concepts more accessible and engaging.\n* The tone is conversational and approachable, making the audience feel like they're having a discussion with the speaker.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a 5/5 is that some parts of the speech may be perceived as slightly too casual or informal for a formal public presentation. However, overall, this speech has a strong persuasive impact due to its engaging storytelling, clever analogies, and effective use of humor.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,1880,16854,5642,89,13,14465,36731,97717,1744,9189,47592,46939,69379,84,89504,409,1208,48659,9517,65272,7930,274,53149,6853,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,1208,84850,4558,21152,358,946,13,34447,17317,11,665,3846,7930,308,96287,6502,11,4864,841,91507,6502,4043,1155,409,9189,5804,20099,934,35329,379,264,15265,16968,6033,326,6,44086,15890,15265,17536,13,2998,20272,11,7643,75765,42676,27584,39043,409,1208,48901,11,1208,5636,36897,409,326,42069,946,11,272,17771,326,42069,946,11,326,55624,8677,13,38891,89,3900,1826,326,6,75876,409,7591,73,3514,978,13,41621,47592,1913,13,41621,12584,89,2800,261,6316,9145,84,6672,3869,1208,293,11206,4091,648,3930,16652,13,34447,665,477,33670,11,9189,23933,10333,934,35329,379,264,653,4046,20609,68,55520,3869,81337,409,1208,60172,409,1208,293,11206,4091,648,13,41621,47592,45575,45889,65995,409,2132,288,5019,35881,1814,11,1826,3846,934,54386,379,11412,11,6033,389,11412,46777,523,1291,6033,29449,293,11206,4091,648,665,5636,409,82291,13,12095,4864,9189,326,34155,31807,3023,265,1765,80259,9952,1208,463,1557,10748,479,66901,64829,11,4864,36731,56586,8047,3869,951,4046,447,811,7930,864,7521,306,665,42463,1647,53052,409,1913,11,1208,62827,3930,523,3675,11,4502,1208,326,4558,49606,60019,296,31769,60171,11,1208,6138,409,1208,293,11206,4091,648,46932,5048,11,5099,2637,5099,2637,1841,3900,47090,14707,4068,35881,1854,2109,974,32592,26725,27750,4742,31539,13,43987,26178,11,4864,9189,1097,48099,46206,41091,665,27525,2145,2058,1647,32592,29137,21935,11,10071,1647,4046,447,367,11,27549,841,15572,68,5636,409,16968,13,13789,11,9036,67882,66021,934,35329,264,3122,11,3900,11412,64972,513,514,296,6,13885,1291,409,26725,3625,523,3675,11,27584,1208,5636,46110,13,19421,76776,11,27584,4502,9189,47592,1208,6140,409,46524,6316,293,11206,4091,648,7930,20272,951,9145,14127,2392,11,1208,463,331,8511,259,6,1138,1815,1765,41091,3869,951,2960,33903,409,1206,316,75104,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,25165,13,48109,682,2439,25945,83457,17317,13253,1880,389,11412,296,4091,29449,5369,8301,1880,294,6,19010,684,452,41901,13510,13,34447,11,87451,29449,305,412,414,665,9822,11,389,29465,68,59394,12155,348,552,3869,719,332,1880,12155,9145,14127,2392,11,272,17771,3869,13510,934,54386,308,6,283,2067,648,6502,1208,70311,3488,11,10071,17317,17317,11142,2439,665,34501,3930,2317,68,13,2582,11,9189,4046,97495,77433,3869,29449,49370,864,7096,1604,11,389,35456,32592,1773,3527,409,35881,1854,26725,3625,49301,9952,5882,40948,978,11,389,57110,52727,2515,91640,6033,3937,26725,3625,4742,31539,11,2536,32592,514,48734,12,511,30808,11,10071,28463,4046,49975,8301,13,62293,3625,18247,8385,16549,288,7930,326,6,343,1037,96642,1099,343,919,3930,220,22,961,1220,3930,272,5976,2933,11,389,1826,16968,22011,4068,27549,934,6,2933,1200,12339,5019,71751,51794,479,1208,90509,13,34447,11,5019,38211,12155,4046,447,811,14707,97717,11,389,841,11412,6502,665,98054,26725,3625,99309,5634,258,11,9952,3625,18247,8385,22012,3869,1208,6140,294,31109,30870,4930,12844,648,9952,951,26883,729,665,326,6,24677,8047,13,27058,45602,11,389,69152,514,51655,57146,13,507,2005,11,17317,4186,19941,41330,22299,50026,40280,4200,13,62293,3846,51655,11,4864,9189,5019,41098,7591,5589,404,951,13307,294,31769,79,10515,3422,12694,11,22299,25400,11,7930,69152,1208,390,46302,294,31769,39624,897,87107,1169,17194,5019,71925,1992,951,33013,98942,409,35881,1854,13,19421,389,11412,68226,22842,1765,52962,1133,3663,665,26883,978,3869,13053,4088,77558,6316,30870,4930,12844,648,4200,13,19421,41091,11,409,3488,1744,4864,296,6,454,2972,11,934,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,7010,29449,272,5976,2933,11,42676,389,11412,379,3869,3842,10018,11,1880,389,11412,296,4091,6316,9145,84,6672,11,4160,321,6496,11,665,92146,3930,51655,409,1296,11,3869,1208,4156,20712,951,18247,12575,288,1880,409,326,52152,2293,2428,13,25145,72,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,49873,24300,96618,362,36815,315,264,586,8982,922,21075,11478,11,11951,39686,279,12939,315,3823,5597,28846,323,25152,304,279,3663,315,27924,13,578,19114,5829,264,1375,15436,15398,320,8332,6714,1148,311,656,1306,25270,990,8,311,41
