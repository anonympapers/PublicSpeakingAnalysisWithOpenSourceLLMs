{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-28T20:32:03.997775504Z","response":"TRANSCRIPTION:\n\nThe speaker starts by asking the audience to imagine a scenario where different objects, such as rollers, office chairs, satellites, and life machines, all contain bearings. The speaker then explains that bearings are used to reduce friction between two surfaces in motion. They provide historical context about the development of bearings, from ancient Egyptian pyramids to the 15th century discovery of the rolling principle.\n\nThe speaker then dives deeper into the world of bearings, explaining how they work and why they're important. They use an analogy about driving a car on hilly terrain, where the road's undulations affect the driver's experience. Similarly, imperfections in bearing design can affect their performance.\n\nThe speaker shares personal experiences from their thesis research, highlighting the importance of predicting bearing behavior based on defects and frequencies. They explain how they developed calculation codes to achieve this goal.\n\nFinally, the speaker provides a relatable example about using GPS navigation with a satellite-based system, emphasizing the impact that even small bearing defects can have on accuracy.\n\nÉCHELLE:\n\n[1=pas du tout persuasif à 5=très persuasif]\n\nDIMENSION:\n\nThe dimension is the persuasive power of the discourse. How well does the speaker engage and convince their audience?\n\nTÂCHE:\n\nScore: 4\n\nReasoning:\nThe speaker provides a clear and engaging introduction, using relatable examples to explain complex concepts. They share personal experiences and provide historical context, which helps build trust with the audience. The speaker's use of analogies and metaphors (e.g., driving on hilly terrain) is effective in making abstract ideas more accessible. However, some parts of the discourse could be improved upon, such as providing more concrete data or examples to support their claims. Overall, the speaker presents a strong case and effectively persuades their audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,12095,4864,9189,62163,74940,1826,514,1486,34561,9465,951,6638,1759,11,6316,523,24201,409,44402,11,653,24088,1880,6316,5780,3869,1208,17536,13,41621,12584,89,757,75871,265,11,3869,4972,72,8065,934,467,13,19421,14707,7216,89,45325,42676,59157,2058,26725,27750,2909,1441,11,687,72,89810,951,29465,91555,3869,17536,13,34447,45575,3869,75249,39043,113147,653,29465,273,2933,30,50501,44424,11,27549,1826,6502,1744,951,4611,2453,3422,11,3625,4046,13849,80463,11,272,17771,653,25911,3930,42463,7930,43989,5636,51794,409,7591,91312,951,2909,1441,326,414,5919,11,665,3625,66517,519,29465,1565,1765,951,89781,20486,70566,285,96308,934,41901,3625,5542,1821,8065,2092,13,356,17771,15105,3869,1062,519,326,6,1617,1815,409,4671,2058,3625,6816,332,3808,9465,514,2092,1880,514,1529,70,13,7695,2267,664,969,76826,9604,265,514,220,868,68,97739,9326,5019,1744,3625,5954,77,2402,3567,582,79738,59148,85,8135,514,82660,3527,3930,29465,1001,7930,29557,409,48021,665,12984,653,31260,1370,39474,3869,653,47838,16968,665,4017,519,3625,6816,332,3808,13,34447,45575,3869,75249,39043,594,16167,11,653,490,1791,24068,321,30,19421,14707,653,29465,1001,11,272,17771,40321,978,409,426,11,7930,82133,23761,23828,5512,9465,26633,9145,1157,13,81501,1208,12984,11,3625,293,8839,82133,513,7591,91312,3869,326,55624,57663,951,9145,1157,1880,44351,20028,16968,514,7364,3930,29465,1001,13,34447,4160,321,6496,11,1370,86633,3900,17782,1744,3625,9145,1157,841,15132,6502,86966,1133,4319,360,17724,11,7930,3625,1560,1321,306,3869,1069,483,951,47371,2784,82,409,21901,82,13,14465,9189,3327,2428,13,38891,89,45325,31632,665,9467,3095,7010,15265,2307,81645,409,1208,88100,30,19421,39015,11,8065,45369,409,15265,45640,11,9189,12584,89,1370,4545,16953,404,951,1400,1572,13,19421,3869,294,81979,1798,1821,82133,389,1028,9517,79,978,466,6316,47528,409,294,820,14997,13,46706,3625,26633,4865,11,15265,81645,11412,1647,466,44829,2579,3380,408,265,665,46932,519,1208,6149,13,34447,9189,9189,87040,14707,1744,9189,308,6,5164,89,6502,594,25526,404,3625,123299,9004,72597,11,87158,9189,16953,15760,89,1208,1400,483,1744,3625,294,820,14997,13,19421,14707,5019,29449,29465,1001,11,272,17771,653,28800,24068,321,13,7695,308,41901,40142,6502,514,27584,52962,1133,65735,326,58591,31150,951,47371,2784,82,1880,43153,1448,978,45045,13,19421,272,17771,66090,1744,503,34155,22011,42844,7643,270,4558,325,13,14465,52895,375,951,14236,409,5935,82,11,29557,61512,409,27389,3826,514,52962,1133,951,29465,91555,65735,3625,47371,2784,82,1880,409,26077,11412,85815,326,6,58400,1765,514,72601,1765,514,43014,3900,1826,20605,978,13,3341,1370,86633,11,409,25500,47371,2784,82,56311,39929,653,5536,5636,2267,1260,934,31109,50787,409,16968,46110,13,19421,272,17771,294,49455,519,5636,3062,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,653,955,409,29465,1001,54008,1291,76190,978,29465,1001,409,2361,40280,6033,409,1486,425,13,3402,1466,2439,653,51173,5019,379,46131,653,28800,5636,1206,1334,13,41621,961,10333,665,9467,3095,6033,45575,4068,9189,12584,89,409,326,6,88988,8065,9511,67763,13,19421,22299,3625,1541,4978,15132,6502,665,4046,6232,978,11,503,49963,1082,1647,24229,7930,77433,3869,653,24088,11,74282,77422,7643,2361,1880,25692,44351,757,8890,1814,13,34447,4502,3625,29465,91555,409,1647,24088,14848,951,47371,2784,82,11,27584,409,45889,117825,986,409,2606,318,75104,11,7643,2361,92215,23761,653,51625,1082,409,51854,15395,316,75104,13,14465,10025,593,45575,294,49152,13603,6316,92020,1765,7643,9284,13,1611,841,56316,2961,1553,7010,326,6,88988,13,650,13603,27584,409,841,56316,1913,404,7643,270,4558,325,13,41621,326,6,4202,74466,39587,13550,285,1880,9964,834,3625,47371,2784,82,409,57128,951,29465,91555,3869,17536,1880,259,6,434,306,13327,5019,41091,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,49873,24300,512,198,791,19114,8638,555,10371,279,10877,311,13085,264,15398,1405,2204,6302,11,1778,439,89713,11,5274,26993,11,47710,11,323,2324,12933,11,682,6782,35553,13,578,19114,1243,15100,430,35553,527,1511,311,8108,39676,1990,1403,27529,304,11633,13,2435,3493,13970,2317,922,279,4500,315,35553,11,505,14154,33589,4611,87473,311,279,220,868,339,9478,18841,
