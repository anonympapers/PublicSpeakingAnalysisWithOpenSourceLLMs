{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-29T00:00:39.876186877Z","response":"A French text! ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·\n\nBased on the TRANSCRIPTION, I will evaluate the persuasion degree of the discourse. Here is my analysis:\n\nThe speaker seems to be trying to persuade the audience by using a complex and convoluted argumentation structure, with many repetitive phrases and sentences that start with \"En ce que...\" (e.g., \"En ce que tu as Ã©tÃ© nous devons en permanence de vous adapter...\"). This approach may lead to confusion rather than persuasion.\n\nThe speaker also uses vague terms such as \"le plus que le plus\" and \"ce sera proche le plus\" without providing concrete examples or evidence to support their claims. This lack of specificity makes it difficult for the audience to understand what is being argued.\n\nFurthermore, the text includes many instances of self-referential language (\"En ce que...\"), which can come across as arrogant or self-serving rather than persuasive.\n\nIn terms of logical reasoning, the speaker's argumentation appears to be based on a series of unsubstantiated assumptions and vague assertions. While some points may seem reasonable, others are unclear or contradictory, making it challenging for the audience to follow the logic.\n\nOverall, I would rate this text as 1 out of 5 in terms of persuasion degree (Ã‰chelle). The speaker's argumentation is not effective in convincing the audience due to its complexity, vagueness, and lack of logical rigor.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,12095,9189,9189,294,3695,7643,25108,45632,11,9189,73953,89,25692,85815,8065,40021,899,409,17317,653,6485,68,5636,409,11494,336,1725,514,2145,425,6033,35597,3869,294,25108,4978,48595,978,7010,514,4632,409,7643,25108,45632,1880,25692,85815,409,513,25692,7591,268,404,1744,3846,35737,463,1557,514,5636,1744,7643,38317,665,8841,38469,1880,1744,514,5636,1744,514,5636,13,2998,3846,1744,9964,439,24560,17317,3567,2439,665,11885,768,409,9189,13253,10253,6155,17724,409,1208,8841,38469,26584,13,27058,75871,265,10253,35881,6948,409,3846,1744,9189,864,55506,409,1208,70477,346,409,59157,13109,11,17317,1208,514,4632,1370,3273,625,1133,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,315,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,5034,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,32393,258,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,43666,632,1880,1744,3625,60227,3869,19730,18711,4068,514,46415,7591,1834,1880,1744,3869,1208,1488,409,20662,88411,653,28800,7591,81,412,5048,11,38831,283,52274,6316,3738,68,12881,3748,978,13,2998,37622,11,17317,3567,2439,51913,2058,653,436,4575,85489,7930,665,25692,282,5615,466,11,514,9427,593,665,326,22827,301,308,17771,6502,7317,582,99188,13,19421,514,54409,7986,409,79641,5171,425,1826,1208,76407,15890,3900,1028,40142,3869,934,31109,85434,8065,42775,7010,653,60697,409,3846,57992,11,7930,5019,969,274,49152,52424,7317,582,99188,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,22
