They use examples and evidence to support their claims, and also acknowledge potential limitations and challenges. However, the speaker could have been more convincing by providing more specific examples and data to back up their arguments.\n\nTâche: Based on the transcript, I would give a score of 3 out of 5, indicating that the speaker presents a persuasive argument but could have been more effective in using evidence and examples to support their claims.\n\nThe speaker provides a clear explanation of their research project and its potential impact on the education system. They identify a pressing issue (the difficulty faced by students in finding employment after graduation) and propose a solution (developing active learning methods and project-based work to help students develop desired competencies). The speaker also acknowledges the challenges of implementing such changes and the need for collaboration among various stakeholders.\n\nHowever, the speaker could have been more convincing by providing more specific examples of successful implementation of these methods in other contexts, as well as data or research to support their claims. Additionally, the speaker could have addressed potential criticisms or counterarguments to their proposal.\n\nOverall, while the speaker presents a clear and persuasive argument, they could have been more effective in providing concrete evidence and examples to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,2581,325,1759,7890,9073,1597,1970,8837,29892,7847,802,432,29915,1794,844,3977,29948,611,266,17449,29892,1444,592,4771,443,7006,2257,439,29915,2719,1283,15044,267,29889,2581,26099,270,29915,585,312,5411,1647,427,18768,19951,29892,3503,1444,26099,5695,5178,453,1908,8939,13247,1387,818,301,29915,26759,316,425,1528,305,1808,29889,8748,818,2257,13275,29892,1444,16623,8691,316,1601,11107,270,29915,26739,800,29889,438,14340,6972,17417,29892,29871,4277,2947,7848,25235,2258,21873,818,330,29539,9411,966,16283,29889,1174,8714,29892,5178,453,1908,8939,13247,1387,29892,432,29915,562,2388,5889,966,23930,647,1934,316,301,29915,26759,1465,425,13852,316,6267,544,15819,29889,11948,270,3246,29899,4346,29875,29892,25178,707,301,29915,29872,2192,280,316,301,29915,1947,647,882,13159,14508,22572,29915,15669,29973,29871,30219,29874,9484,12470,29892,1465,1601,4946,2131,29892,373,16133,1908,712,301,29915,264,1324,29884,707,16089,2131,29892,301,29915,7851,291,6351,9139,270,29915,348,2298,4595,5419,270,29915,1893,4749,1934,29889,1394,1044,27751,29892,373,1040,403,712,24145,21423,270,29915,1947,647,882,282,8146,818,25497,276,818,443,13547,427,1324,29884,29892,2535,553,2852,4749,1934,1750,9411,966,26943,1750,316,301,29915,26759,3435,652,572,30069,4467,29892,2123,1750,452,12111,794,2331,270,29915,13141,275,818,425,447,19072,316,6267,4021,2450,29889,1720,707,12866,5065,1885,1671,301,29915,26759,316,409,4327,261,29889,10793,13852,1634,852,1190,443,23930,647,882,1644,5606,1661,2298,1190,454,4048,6390,29892,3503,1190,966,2852,4749,1934,3911,29899,18202,29889,1281,7283,23855,882,29892,439,29915,342,29899,346,712,29871,4277,1804,28821,29973,8748,6079,29892,373,2947,13942,29877,2496,553,282,2487,13247,347,1044,3145,29892,13545,868,18848,427,4464,15744,29892,1671,19172,276,818,301,29915,1893,4749,1934,316,13942,29877,2496,553,752,29948,841,778,14333,1041,1465,454,9122,6351,9139,29889,1720,343,263,553,26943,818,23563,2245,29879,316,2600,439,29915,265,325,19680,29899,29883,3121,1750,263,1518,1064,2073,553,544,19669,24233,3794,29889,11948,707,29899,346,712,18729,9378,277,818,4327,261,454,21423,29973,315,13946,882,2331,29892,5646,1437,7241,29948,29892,12866,316,27962,316,13545,14511,5056,11695,2406,29892,818,1597,1841,1808,4327,1318,1190,20364,553,544,19669,1465,301,29915,2611,5008,29889,8748,4191,432,29915,29874,603,966,11482,275,29892,274,29915,342,454,29140,316,611,266,17449,29889,11948,3440,27516,443,23930,647,882,439,29915,309,343,966,302,29915,342,6701,2331,20179,8997,29871,29906,29900,6063,29892,270,29915,370,9214,1089,553,4760,8192,553,6745,1475,29889,6803,19601,29892,1487,425,7632,270,29915,1540,15217,2893,2131,316,301,29915,8463,264,23520,29892,980,302,29915,29891,263,2331,316,13852,1950,29889,1720,302,29915,29891,263,2331,316,7632,2893,9407,1950,29892,1354,373,302,29915,29874,6701,2331,966,23930,647,1934,818,21206,4600,634,818,29231,5495,6314,19882,29889,438,1481,29892,427,4951,454,25698,5000,29892,274,29915,342,712,301,29915,1947,647,882,707,1597,5039,2131,9577,899,9407,29889,838,943,3440,269,29915,29891,23532,29973,2598,13752,17449,707,439,29915,309,21668,1539,2484,966,18554,427,1970,8837,29892,1671,439,29915,1808,409,269,2016,15390,316,269,29915,996,1875,1465,7015,6314,10270,29889,3219,1437,3034,1173,1136,2488,818,9484,261,553,6314,10270,316,18848,2535,966,23930,647,1934,24792,7147,634,9073,427,29835,712,7015,6314,10270,938,20608,1041,6728,19882,443,14738,8182,277,1190,454,23930,647,424,29892,3503,5695,553,15001,1379,6343,271,10270,29892,553,1044,11620,868,9122,5264,23837,1387,29892,634,6079,10019,680,29885,358,553,2852,4749,1934,29889,350,999,29892,301,29915,24031,553,1044,11620,1671,1597,1841,1808,13852,868,21423,29892,634,274,29915,342,18916,6722,29871,4277,409,752,9854,29889,1459,346,712,19601,5695,29892,1444,16623,8691,868,21423,29889,838,943,7890,4788,29920,592,2970,3503,3440,8164,29899,5474,712,5291,1757,275,1597,23520,2854,634,5713,519,29889,8748,6079,29892,1444,325,1759,286,759,553,2637,2034,575,634,553,2531,690,1841,16041,10270,29889,2581,325,1759,16455,643,553,21195,316,18848,270,29915,24430,2535,966,23930,647,1934,29892,3503,5695,2535,966,2852,4749,1934,634,2535,425,5178,453,1908,282,2487,13247,1387,29889,1632,20032,818,5278,23520,29892,432,29915,9983,1908,17737,2853,3479,15570,3409,4110,282,2487,13247,3783,316,301,29915,1947,647,882,13159,14508,7691,29889,8748,818,425,1841,1558,568,270,29915,348,2298,4595,5419,270,29915,1893,4749,1934,29892,13545,577,275,29899,27048,20077,29892,13545,577,275,29899,27048,610,2085,29889,11948,270,3246,12866,29892,7890,452,1190,26477,2331,427,7945,270,29915,711,2974,1597,14111,29899,5474,29892,2257,1750,409,260,29915,711,16349,1577,4514,29871,3067,3210,6670,1307,353,518,30062,305,1808,316,29871,29896,29922,18182,868,5646,20408,294,361,818,29871,29945,29922,509,2093,20408,294,361,5586,4571,29924,1430,13381,353,518,30113,26814,1029,
