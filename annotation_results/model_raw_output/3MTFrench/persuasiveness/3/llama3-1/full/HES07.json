{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-28T10:03:52.94188154Z","response":"Based on the TRANSCRIPTION, I would rate the degree of persuasion as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as emotional appeals (e.g., \"pauvret√©\", \"malnutrition\"), logical reasoning (e.g., explaining the importance of standardizing medical treatments), and personal anecdotes (e.g., sharing her own experience with pharmaceutical companies) to build a convincing argument. The tone is persuasive, yet remains professional and objective.\n\nThe speaker's use of statistics and data analysis to support their claims adds credibility to their argument, making it more convincing for the audience. Additionally, the mention of international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) lends credibility to the topic and reinforces the importance of standardizing medical treatments.\n\nHowever, I would deduct one point because the speaker's tone occasionally veers towards being too personal or anecdotal, which may not be entirely relevant to the topic at hand. Nevertheless, overall, the speaker presents a strong, convincing case that effectively persuades the audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3489,438,389,4160,275,3869,61285,1880,829,296,12339,274,41901,374,265,20662,6685,11,389,25692,23423,261,11,84295,85,2171,978,11,8811,83664,11,274,27688,6496,11,10071,41091,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,9189,1647,95920,11,272,17771,514,312,15769,934,54386,25692,78551,1765,514,2145,425,409,20662,38920,37254,13,356,17771,1208,85877,22550,409,829,296,12339,7930,274,6,6581,16716,409,25400,20028,41635,261,653,35030,292,2908,7930,1826,653,25500,34527,68,27584,37953,447,80720,514,296,19010,853,3869,816,4202,13,41621,73953,89,934,80720,11412,379,2961,1553,11,3900,514,47090,11,272,17771,16595,5019,326,6,391,275,635,13,61285,326,6,408,1133,11,33013,4558,451,3846,27584,46932,5048,13,12095,40744,3625,550,5014,594,28111,306,3869,39043,11,9189,73953,89,60019,934,80720,82133,84788,404,3869,46932,265,28130,89714,11,3846,7930,1826,83195,5019,27549,11,7010,653,14435,263,8078,294,52374,69,34395,3930,27430,11,3625,16968,3154,519,49733,11,3869,12366,13,19421,4864,36731,3738,1744,26725,3625,6699,30179,812,7010,1208,71632,11,49733,11,3846,57992,11,15132,6225,21041,3869,951,78199,22299,11,1043,81239,4791,72,11,1400,556,11,7294,1481,62114,13,2998,4606,11,77818,43765,11,1208,38682,1001,367,1860,685,13,19421,41199,220,679,19,11,27549,33330,8065,9511,67763,15430,25297,2428,409,550,15170,1744,28130,43453,35030,292,2908,56311,23761,42587,5512,665,64032,8747,2416,593,13,350,2053,1744,27389,46790,1880,15878,5107,978,11,665,653,3937,11,389,1370,273,294,6,10543,87782,13,34447,514,2046,11,272,17771,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,409,5410,294,57286,29246,11,665,5589,65268,13,7695,308,59858,50590,6502,11,44829,593,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,264,24560,294,41901,75831,13,13789,11,4864,9189,326,69537,53218,409,296,41901,7591,788,268,69,685,7930,73953,409,28130,35030,292,2908,11,272,17771,6502,52842,42625,4046,1325,306,13,16062,16081,11,503,34155,7631,978,3869,28130,2748,294,6,87064,484,404,28130,9517,1335,11,514,65285,266,409,1208,85424,11,514,27138,7930,264,24560,100243,11,1880,84871,294,81979,52962,3808,7930,757,29557,73468,3869,99961,8363,1208,4287,87782,13,1252,28800,5636,409,56321,8261,11,9952,6316,51651,19660,294,6,17156,458,409,272,3023,265,11,84364,409,220,868,410,1880,85424,409,35030,292,24469,11,389,25692,23761,4046,26591,978,13,9240,10333,45575,3869,20028,89504,40744,27750,46681,11,3869,3625,60946,265,3869,3625,9517,12023,3869,3625,98054,60538,21041,13,19421,5019,39043,11,503,49963,1082,89,951,75601,2601,20719,8467,294,6,44803,325,48539,11067,7447,1773,18658,8301,13,432,5512,495,266,11,503,34155,18757,72796,26725,3625,35030,292,24469,1765,6316,86806,1880,27584,48454,1880,665,34501,409,28130,2361,11,7930,7591,3825,14707,97717,951,52962,3808,7930,14848,24560,9466,14014,11,503,34155,18757,3625,7591,566,9779,22299,14240,519,4287,5512,6033,2536,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,503,49963,1082,3846,91558,8135,13327,5019,4046,68019,1327,76430,409,80080,75332,2436,13,2895,66096,3869,25400,11,389,829,275,1370,51173,934,6,37907,15132,3625,33209,8467,7930,15132,14707,4287,5512,1370,3625,60404,665,9822,13,19421,5019,66056,7930,841,514,15132,6502,11,389,829,275,934,6,37907,15132,3625,802,9769,9004,7930,29557,2221,1188,8065,9511,67763,934,85217,3625,52895,46225,409,64972,9427,16339,28130,653,296,531,3972,13,1611,5636,665,5636,409,52571,1759,15132,92759,5512,1370,3846,83597,1880,45441,42587,5512,13,5186,12416,326,6,13885,978,16271,11,514,3678,511,1880,326,62595,269,588,73,11,951,46681,82133,23761,6667,5512,665,9392,466,265,11,665,4466,451,1880,8065,123295,13,7695,47090,13510,1744,503,34155,15925,653,46110,16081,409,17258,346,9517,54921,479,11,665,5589,13,1252,17475,978,16081,409,17258,346,13,445,6,39883,62891,11,326,6,58904,62940,20487,409,1208,77323,264,78511,978,653,2246,409,293,6217,9994,72,7930,42182,29557,10367,294,58591,73511,15171,1208,85424,665,6900,409,296,6853,1880,26725,3625,60404,274,17771,312,2792,333,665,1046,19010,14081,519,514,82620,294,6,306,404,1880,21965,348,44688,10737,978,10253,60404,13,19421,7010,3846,2246,11,20662,15244,951,17089,653,285,264,13836,625,978,326,55624,14081,49530,409,296,1339,969,12,6723,2249,13,362,13836,625,978,326,55624,14081,49530,409,3846,91558,8135,13327,11,7930,1370,264,4618,1759,11,1826,665,45369,409,1652,2461,1370,22171,768,95199,26193,3930,35030,292,2908,13,1611,11655,74725,86555,321,11,514,5410,294,57286,799,409,326,6,10543,87782,264,20272,436,395,84,535,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,6
