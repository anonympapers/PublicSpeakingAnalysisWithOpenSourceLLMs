{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-28T13:38:03.251037116Z","response":"**TRANSCRIPTION**\n\nThe text appears to be a transcript of a public performance or presentation, likely from a psychological research context. The speaker seems to be discussing the importance of adapting to contradictory concepts in psychology and how this relates to their own research. The text is written in French with no clear structure or organization.\n\n**ÉCHELLE**\n\nThis section provides an \"échelle\" or scale for evaluating the persuasion level of the discourse, ranging from 1 (not at all persuasive) to 5 (very persuasive).\n\n**DIMENSION**\n\nThe dimension appears to be assessing the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the message in the transcription. The goal is to evaluate how well the person writes a convincing message.\n\n**TÂCHE**\n\nBased on the evaluation criteria, I would give this transcript a score of **2**, indicating that it is somewhat persuasive but lacks clarity and structure. While the speaker presents some interesting ideas, the text is written in a confusing and meandering style, making it difficult to follow their argument or draw conclusions about their research.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,12095,9189,9189,294,3695,7643,25108,45632,11,9189,73953,89,25692,85815,8065,40021,899,409,17317,653,6485,68,5636,409,11494,336,1725,514,2145,425,6033,35597,3869,294,25108,4978,48595,978,7010,514,4632,409,7643,25108,45632,1880,25692,85815,409,513,25692,7591,268,404,1744,3846,35737,463,1557,514,5636,1744,7643,38317,665,8841,38469,1880,1744,514,5636,1744,514,5636,13,2998,3846,1744,9964,439,24560,17317,3567,2439,665,11885,768,409,9189,13253,10253,6155,17724,409,1208,8841,38469,26584,13,27058,75871,265,10253,35881,6948,409,3846,1744,9189,864,55506,409,1208,70477,346,409,59157,13109,11,17317,1208,514,4632,1370,3273,625,1133,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,315,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,5034,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,32393,258,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,409,1208,70477,346,43666,632,1880,1744,3625,60227,3869,19730,18711,4068,514,46415,7591,1834,1880,1744,3869,1208,1488,409,20662,88411,653,28800,7591,81,412,5048,11,38831,283,52274,6316,3738,68,12881,3748,978,13,2998,37622,11,17317,3567,2439,51913,2058,653,436,4575,85489,7930,665,25692,282,5615,466,11,514,9427,593,665,326,22827,301,308,17771,6502,7317,582,99188,13,19421,514,54409,7986,409,79641,5171,425,1826,1208,76407,15890,3900,1028,40142,3869,934,31109,85434,8065,42775,7010,653,60697,409,3846,57992,11,7930,5019,969,274,49152,52424,7317,582,99188,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750
