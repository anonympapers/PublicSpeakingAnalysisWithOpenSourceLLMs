What we call polymers actually gather all plastic materials. This includes the phone case, running bags, and probably a good part of the chairs you're sitting on. You might wonder if these materials are extremely well-known to scientists today. And no, not really. Let's take my phone case for example. If I pull it, it will deform. We can be sure that it deforms in function of the force I exert. However, we're not entirely sure what happens physically within the material when it deforms. Well, that's precisely the goal of my thesis: to understand what happens inside the material when it deforms. I'm trying to determine what is called a model. We could make an analogy between the model I use to describe a polymer and a network of humans. For example, you could be a magnificent polymer. It would simply require that you not give me your hand. Then, we would have to imagine that you had longer arms that are actually shorter in reality. In such a way that each person could link up with two other people and would have their arms bent in the following way... I'll come back to one or another who is on the edge. For example, my friend. I'll seize him by the shoulders or waist and pull extremely hard because I'm very muscular. What will happen? It's very likely that the person at the end of the network won't be able to maintain this position anymore because they won't have enough strength to do so. He will therefore fold his arms. This deformation will then propagate until it reaches me, allowing me to step back. We can summarize the goal of my thesis in a very simple way: I'm trying to determine the force of each individual within the network in order to regain the global behavior of the material that we know, namely how I pull back in function of the force I exert. The strength of an individual within the network is not simple. It will depend on many parameters such as temperature, but also age. And yes, in my model, individuals have an age just like real life. And they can get older. In fact, in my model, the older an individual becomes, the stronger he or she gets. You can understand this in a rather simple way. As one ages, one spends more time in that position, resisting to a force exerted on him. He will therefore have gained muscle through training. It's a bit like when you and I go to the gym to become stronger. The phone case, for example, will tend to become more rigid over time because the individuals who make it up are becoming stronger.]\n\nÉCHELLE = [Scale of 1=not at all persuasive to 5=very persuasive]\n\nDIMENSION = [To your opinion, what is the level of persuasion of this discourse in this transcription, that is to say whether the person effectively writes a convincing message?
