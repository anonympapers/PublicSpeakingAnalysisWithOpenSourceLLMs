{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-28T12:45:44.069799551Z","response":"Based on the transcription, I would rate the degree of persuasion as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is generally sound and well-structured. They start by establishing a connection with their audience, using humor to break the ice. They then transition into discussing the topic at hand, presenting their ideas in a clear and concise manner. The use of analogies (e.g., comparing data analysis to searching through a library) helps to make complex concepts more accessible.\n\nThe speaker also uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"Ã§a joue plus tard\") and emphasis (\"Un des objectifs... est des conseils oures\") to drive home their points. However, there are a few moments where the delivery feels a bit uneven or rushed, which might detract from the overall impact of the message.\n\nOverall, I would say that the speaker's message is effectively conveyed and persuasive, but not quite reaching its full potential due to some minor flaws in delivery.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,1208,2869,38469,51307,2428,17317,29557,294,93825,26725,951,1160,78,3946,1880,951,27389,35573,3625,37923,13,4829,467,11,1208,2869,38469,51307,2428,2773,295,969,409,20028,100198,1880,3869,34923,285,51625,1854,934,80720,264,41869,25843,5019,16456,3458,66014,326,6,28400,414,8065,8924,326,6,3989,33670,514,25911,13,64105,64,11,503,34155,55162,10036,513,89504,5636,62197,13,423,6,370,541,11,39043,28068,68,5636,62197,13,423,6,370,541,11,3625,274,1133,9189,89504,409,1208,77463,11245,354,2428,13,5034,63828,5717,6853,264,28154,268,11,389,25692,14240,664,1291,326,6,90446,294,22827,1860,290,13,4702,68,42138,11,4538,520,466,43711,39361,11,10071,6502,79380,100198,5019,27389,35573,13,12095,4538,463,8995,4499,11,2126,519,653,10025,593,6033,6502,13,622,34155,55162,10036,513,3327,72684,64972,13,1252,1860,290,294,6,19010,19388,11,28490,951,5636,35881,318,458,2107,668,324,7930,264,32347,265,48488,294,6,41540,811,1765,26725,3625,40321,1821,11,1765,26725,27750,40321,1821,13,27058,9189,71751,6316,887,8047,11,42138,71686,6316,77818,294,31769,588,4618,11,389,294,1601,64,951,5636,294,31769,5717,2606,81560,294,6,10610,9034,417,3869,23702,261,13,356,17771,653,5363,274,31769,783,1215,13,1952,40142,326,98279,4099,294,6,20243,2058,8065,20272,6316,4046,20609,68,44615,8942,4558,593,11,84871,409,15471,417,3869,78551,1880,3869,8678,805,13,46706,27750,2606,81560,294,31769,5717,77,5512,11,389,23008,325,514,38900,951,274,85798,7930,18757,79738,23761,9559,5512,3869,951,52962,3808,3869,7617,12249,13,4366,51173,11,653,3091,8783,21430,1481,27620,593,11,951,2798,14081,2859,11,6033,951,3577,919,7930,841,3381,60946,265,934,22827,951,40321,1821,1826,665,8137,13,5034,38317,951,52962,3808,3869,7617,12249,1826,7010,20662,36897,10484,13109,409,2536,5392,5512,11,308,17771,6502,1180,77776,6502,3284,13,7671,519,934,80720,1860,290,11,389,1826,42182,9517,4581,404,653,43453,13,34447,6502,951,7363,8467,4647,331,31539,586,82,13,356,17771,326,6,1132,68,74672,5048,12,651,1188,13,1252,951,1665,22589,951,5634,5512,11,1826,951,92980,6033,417,951,12823,409,49586,76608,13,27058,3625,20028,11,503,34155,296,6,1354,23772,653,5089,294,31109,887,8047,13,9170,1880,31914,580,11,653,1963,13,1952,1826,26725,3869,326,31769,56745,13,1952,264,42587,978,653,1963,5019,88817,9211,100198,3625,44827,11,15878,98004,2439,11,951,78551,11,326,6,283,19456,425,1218,1291,13,6178,72,11,503,49963,1082,3625,123299,9004,7546,288,13,622,34155,9517,47348,1208,10484,13109,951,46681,22209,14014,5019,46524,100198,3625,44827,7930,17317,92759,306,13,622,34155,59062,978,39587,5019,20245,35573,951,12823,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,11,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,312,5741,11,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,514,83597,7033,978,8637,2428,11,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,75831,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,514,83597,7033,978,8637,2428,11,28391,1474,6870,11,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,18027,261,951,46681,951,46681,951,46681,18757,1056,5512,13,356,17771,1208,887,8047,13,25145,72,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,46940,11,358,1053,4478,279,8547,315,98224,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,596,33811,374,8965,5222,323,1664,12,52243,13,2435,1212,555,31692,264,3717,449,872,10877,11,1701,28485,311,1464,279,10054,13,2435,1243,9320,1139,25394,279,8712,520,1450,11,32644,872,6848,304,264,2867,323,64694,11827,13,578,1005,315,24291,552,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,828,6492,311,15389,1555,264,6875,8,8779,311,1304,6485,19476,810,15987,627,198,791,19114,1101,5829,87068,7766,1778,439,54515,3573,17930,28068,68,5636,62197,909,323,25679,3573,1844,951,1665,22589,1131,1826,951,92980,6033,417,909,311,6678,2162,872,3585,13,4452,11,1070,527,264,2478,14269,1405,279,9889,11321,264,2766,61437,477,33341,11,902,2643,35453,533,505,279,8244,5536,315,279,1984,627,198,28589,11,358,1053,2019,430,279,19114,596,1984,374,13750,73897,323,66343,11,719,539,5115,19261,1202,2539,4754,4245,311,1063,9099,41859,304,9889,13,128009],"total_duration":110792875275,"load_duration":172348,"prompt_eval_count":801,"prompt_eval_duration":83408092000,"eval_count":192,"eval_duration":27384050
