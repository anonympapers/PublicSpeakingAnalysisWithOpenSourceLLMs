It's said to be optically invisible. I'm not an astrophysicist. I don't do quantum physics or even math. Many among you would say that I'm not even a scientist. I'm a lawyer. But I've chosen to dedicate myself to this object which defies all explanation. The common sense is that a black hole is also an abyss, a prison. More specifically, I've spoken about the relationship between the detainee and the penal administration. The detainee is seen as a person subject to service obligations, obsessed with prescriptions, i.e., obligations to conform under penalty of sanction. For example, placement in solitary confinement or isolation from the group and where they are deprived of activity. However, if the necessary obligations are imposed on the detainee, that's not enough to achieve the finality of punishment. Indeed, every punishment must find a balance between different objectives. It must sanction the perpetrator of an offense to show society's disapproval and prevent others from committing similar acts, but it must also rehabilitate. Allow the individual to understand their act so as not to repeat it. Prison punishment must therefore offer something else than just the horizon of uncertainty facing the detainee. So that prison can open up the future of the detainee, I propose continuing an evolution that has been underway for several years and which I have been able to observe by studying different texts of law and court decisions. I propose qualifying the detainee as a \"public service penal user\". A use of public services dedicated to human rights in the state support guarantees, particularly the right to normal functioning of public services and the right to attention from public services. Just like the passion for using hospital public services, there is the right to an always functioning hospital. And under exemplary sanitary conditions and the right to receive care, the detainee must be able to benefit from detention conditions that are fair, without overcrowding prison and obtain a service from the administration, a service that is linked to punishment and which will give meaning, a rehabilitation service. However, if today the right to decent detention has been affirmed, the right to reinsertion exists only indirectly through the protection of other rights, such as the right to family life. But it's reinsertion that will allow effective counter-reoffending. Recognize, at first, the status of public service penal use is a fundamental step, which would oblige the State to help nights after returning to society. It would permit a deep reform of the penal system for a more effective one. So I don't know what my fate will be, but the only thing I care about is that after 8 years, I won't be free.\n\n**ÉCHELLE**\n\nÉchelle de 1=pas du tout persuasif à 5=très persuasif.\n\n**DIMENSION**\n\nÀ votre avis, quel est le degré de persuasion du discours dans cette transcription, c'est-à-dire que la personne rédige efficacement un message convaincant ?
