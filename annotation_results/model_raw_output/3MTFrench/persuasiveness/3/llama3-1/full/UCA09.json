They seem to be unsure of themselves and their message, which makes it difficult to follow their train of thought.\n\nTÂCHE = 2.5\n\nÉvaluation de la transcription: La personne énonce des phrases confuses et contradictoires, ce qui rend difficile la compréhension de leur message. Leur raisonnement est parfois flou et ils semblent hésiter sur leur position. Cependant, il y a quelques moments où le discours prend un tour plus convaincant, mais cela ne dure pas longtemps.\n\nNote: The ÉCHELLE scale ranges from 1 (pas du tout persuasif - not at all persuasive) to 5 (très persuasif - very persuasive).","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,103846,2383,64,11,2383,64,11,2383,64,11,21143,1666,6733,912,912,11,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,1102,596,4228,369,757,311,656,433,11,719,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,13,3277,358,2019,430,11,1606,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,11,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,9393,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,13,9393,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,9393,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,2030,358,1781,430,422,358,656,433,11,433,1053,15187,4287,856,9021,13,5112,358,3619,1268,2574,690,387,2884,13,358,1781,358,1541,956,617,264,3254,893,430,1102,596,682,358,1205,311,656,13,3277,499,8521,757,11,499,3463,430,358,4265,4018,433,304,1403,9863,13,499,3463,430,358,4265,4018,1578,264,6710,13,2100,358,1436,5622,499,449,264,22145,13,264,6710,315,43459,2403,856,18301,323,856,8071,13,362,1474,587,301,11,56270,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,42065,8886,11450,13,6914,279,5015,584,11,358,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,46940,11,358,1053,15806,279,5178,439,11263,512,198,49873,24300,284,510,19,14,20,60,198,198,76219,24557,284,578,19114,596,33811,374,14738,25420,323,31715,520,3115,13,2435,2873,311,387,44003,315,5694,323,872,1984,11,902,3727,433,5107,311,1833,872,5542,315,3463,627,198,51,33895,44893,284,220,17,13,20,198,198,27887,24756,409,1208,46940,25,5034,54613,4046,40693,951,32847,2389,4881,1880,43561,78,3946,11,3846,7930,17634,77411,1208,13550,978,71,2711,409,28130,1984,13,2009,324,6503,91080,1826,1370,86633,1344,283,1880,46152,80664,306,305,5512,2058,1765,28130,2361,13,356,13059,519,11,3900,379,264,45889,14269,39723,514,2624,2530,35456,653,7364,5636,5804,467,66363,11,10071,45602,841,294,554,6502,1317,67380,627,198,9290,25,578,29124,44893,43,877,5569,21986,505,220,16,320,42201,3930,16968,24613,300,333,482,539,520,682,66343,8,311,220,20,320,376,12416,24613,300,333,482,1633,66343,570,128009],"total_duration":109461140747,"load_duration":220650,"prompt_eval_count":805,"prompt_eval_duration":83484470000,"eval_count":188,"eval_duration":25975871000}
