Eating, sleeping, always not having enough breath, but not calm is not the end of the world. Every year, pollution causes 7 million people to breathe in poisonous air. This is more than the combined deaths from tuberculosis, jabber, and road accidents. According to the World Health Organization, more than 9 out of 10 people breathe in polluted air too much. Therefore, I agree with you that knowing the sources of pollutants is very important. Because this first state, which will allow us to develop strategies for reduction, emissions, and pollution control, is exactly the objective of my thesis. And to better understand it, I'll give you a simple example. For instance, when someone from our town is born in this same geographical location within this room. To do this, it's simple. All we have to do is ask ourselves if we are not already aware of these things. So, let's go. Those who were born in our town, please thank your parents. Thank you, those who were born elsewhere, thank you. You can pass me the mic now, and listen carefully. Those who were born in our town have the same origin. Even if you're not from the same family, this origin is precisely the same as my pollutant. I determine their emission sources, so the air originates from it, making it speak to me in its own way, using specific tools. We who are not from our town do not have taken the same journey to get here. We do not adopt the same modes of transportation. In fact, we have different siblings. This is exactly what I want to understand with my pollutant, an ecological survey that becomes when they move away from the emission sources or origins. Just like some people who have traveled hundreds or even thousands of kilometers could come to our town, pollutants can perverse by traversing hundreds of kilometers and as much darkness. It may also give birth to new pollution, followed by liquid waste in the tenacity. This new pollution, along with secondary pollutants, is just as important as the apparent ones, contributing to phenomena such as air pollution, climate change, and environmental degradation. You see, on one hand, there are these effects of pollution that affect humans and animals, but also the environment and the ecosystem. And yet, we can't ignore the reassurances, right? It's not just about not polluting, it is about doing something. So, before we leave tonight, I'd like each one of us to understand how important it is to take care of the air we breathe.\n\nÉCHELLE:\n\nPersuasion scale from 1 (not at all convincing) to 5 (very convincing)\n\nDIMENSION:\n\nThe degree of persuasion in this transcription is the ability of the speaker to effectively convey a message that convinces the audience.
