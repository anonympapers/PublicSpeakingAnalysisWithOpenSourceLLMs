They argue that this ability is not limited to experts, but rather a natural capacity for humans. The speaker uses the example of using their phone to illustrate how people can predict the consequences of an action without knowing the outcome. This process is called projection.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears and discusses planification, which they describe as finding a sequence of actions to achieve an objective. They provide examples of how this process is used in artificial intelligence, citing the example of a robot that was deployed on Mars and operated for 15 years without human intervention.\n\nThe speaker suggests that their research will focus on developing a super-hero \"hélateur\" (translator) that can be used to understand the workings of the human brain. They highlight three mechanisms: the power of habit, economy of intellectual energy, and dynamic planning. The speaker concludes by saying that they need to stop and take a phone call from their thesis director.\n\n**ÉCHELLE**\n\n1=pas du tout persuasif à 5=très persuasif\n\n**DIMENSION**\n\nThe dimension is the persuasion level of the discourse. In this case, it refers to how effectively the speaker presents their argument and convinces the audience of its validity.\n\n**TÂCHE**\n\nBased on my evaluation, I would give a score of **4/5**. The speaker's argument is clear and well-structured, with examples provided to illustrate their points. However, there are some moments where the speaker appears to be less confident or more casual in their tone (e.g., when they interrupt themselves to take a phone call). Overall, the speaker presents a strong case for the importance of prediction and planning, but could benefit from refining their delivery to make it even more compelling.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,82405,404,2727,1744,17317,74533,26725,2107,4893,409,550,15433,556,3869,1208,96586,13,3489,6870,30,41621,841,757,272,3433,10333,6502,30,14465,91507,9189,514,7591,1677,95920,13,12095,4864,35456,82,1647,100007,22299,272,76832,1880,1744,4864,9189,4160,458,3869,41091,11,1744,11412,2442,57375,513,45347,30,4275,98676,519,6502,11,9189,55162,41881,1647,100007,11,9189,9604,10333,1370,88026,1880,25692,85815,513,272,34858,13,41621,23933,10333,39723,9189,62299,26725,2107,4893,409,27389,35573,3625,1615,978,45045,294,31109,1957,7930,841,841,829,275,6502,35597,59157,12329,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,22343,13,19421,17317,11,4864,834,934,85217,14848,20662,23878,13109,26725,3625,49301,665,54008,1291,5019,59394,951,35881,6948,13,4366,51173,11,4502,4864,5320,2249,917,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,1744,503,53149,6853,14707,4046,1325,336,479,26725,3625,49301,11,1744,42182,12,3841,20028,30,7695,47090,1744,4864,27389,13223,546,978,3625,282,3233,11,1744,4864,514,7591,424,583,4618,11,1744,503,34155,7010,1208,9517,4581,13603,11,1744,4864,52571,653,99077,7010,1208,34024,5019,665,5589,1208,12077,978,13,19421,272,76832,11,5019,46777,14240,2070,11,503,34155,20272,1744,9964,6316,22343,13,24703,1744,17317,11457,2439,409,20028,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,46524,6316,16578,294,91655,5019,93381,71933,653,1665,333,11,274,53149,6853,1208,3197,2461,1880,514,270,25253,12717,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,22425,81235,11,1208,3197,2461,1826,653,951,8106,288,28405,1045,1759,409,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,3869,1208,14175,285,409,75831,951,29807,22299,66090,63484,13,27058,66056,7930,841,514,74282,79738,6502,11,4160,3457,4905,3928,978,13,24703,12585,3154,263,638,7591,981,978,1765,21725,665,220,1049,19,264,24560,7591,6595,978,3900,379,264,45889,5347,33903,42138,220,868,65838,409,82134,4046,2032,12249,3600,1880,220,868,65838,409,3197,2461,13,24703,42844,11,5019,1744,829,3197,2461,34501,818,11,3900,47090,934,35329,513,2503,361,7010,653,50026,40280,4684,4558,79507,7591,23827,978,1880,3900,308,59858,264,6502,294,81979,6299,1744,3625,274,4558,4978,11,3154,519,13510,1744,4502,1208,348,20243,299,1082,653,48449,3675,11,45602,44521,1339,24560,4684,76366,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,294,6,14283,5636,78060,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,58673,15610,7010,653,50026,40280,18003,2428,1880,653,4635,84,13,27058,45602,11,4864,69152,653,2307,71,56771,294,39982,978,5185,324,1744,9189,4635,2852,53070,26725,514,272,5976,2933,2854,467,13,19421,665,54008,1291,11,56321,32118,4919,2191,288,13,2009,21134,11,272,17771,1208,5457,409,1208,426,292,799,13,445,1105,593,4864,7591,52274,583,285,1647,4046,73085,409,100007,11,4864,66517,934,35329,665,20272,653,40126,294,6,28400,1771,69125,1744,4864,66517,409,85722,5636,6033,40970,95103,288,13,4366,346,1744,4864,3625,16796,20272,19227,1001,409,37291,1744,4864,3625,16796,917,6091,13,2009,26633,90272,11,272,17771,326,31769,45317,648,294,31769,64374,17108,31037,13,622,6,4202,2852,18757,46524,653,49348,3197,5019,61158,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,11,1370,51173,11,665,864,52985,4538,99077,665,4799,275,11,6033,14707,665,312,45019,4538,99077,11,10071,22299,48488,409,47104,13,14465,14425,13532,11,4864,35456,82,1208,6425,1208,5636,8795,2852,5048,13,2009,8348,13532,25253,11,272,17771,1208,3197,2461,18003,2428,13,2009,38900,1826,665,6926,51913,3294,1880,4046,12821,361,15878,272,24201,13,27058,1131,7867,1438,11,1120,1133,11,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,757,61158,301,13,14465,91507,2961,5615,466,7643,3197,2461,1880,296,6,1138,5615,466,39015,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,49873,25823,334,198,198,791,19114,3611,14742,430,5127,374,13171,315,52997,279,3938,13,2435,18046,430,420,5845,374,539,7347,311,11909,11,719,4856,264,5933,8824,369,12966,13,578,19114,5829,279,3187,315,1701,872,4641,311,41468,1268,1274,649,7168,279,16296,315,459,1957,2085,14392,279,15632,13,1115,1920,374,2663,22343,627,198,791,19114,1243,29735,54260,323,35434,3197,2461,11,902,814,7664,439,9455,264,8668,315,6299,311,11322,459,16945,13,2435,3493,10507,315,1268,420,1920,374,1511,304,21075,11478,11,33264,279,318
