They want to use a metaphor or a small story to explain their point. They're excited because the video projector is working correctly, and everything depends on it. They'll present three points to explain why Paris doesn't need a plan.\n\nThe first point is their object of study: the public lighting network in Paris. It's not just any object; it's a network of points and connections between them. The speaker finds this topic interesting because it's useful for everyday life, like having streetlights every three years or so. This concept is holistic in urbanistic terms.\n\nNext, they need a framework: the mutations of Parisian urban planning. They mention that Paris wasn't always the same city; its form has changed over time. The speaker thinks that reconnecting this concept to how the city's form changes could give it a place alongside transportation networks or cycling infrastructure.\n\nFinally, they need a problem to focus on. This is where they'll present their scientific question: why \"intelligent cities\" are often linked with public lighting networks? It's because there's a new urban ideal implied by this concept. Some people want to extend certain areas of the city to make it smarter. The speaker thinks that the public lighting network is connected to Parisian mutations, and how it can build an intelligent city.\n\n**ÉCHELLE**\n\n1-5 scale: Persuasiveness\n\n**DIMENSION**\n\nHow well does the speaker present a convincing message?
