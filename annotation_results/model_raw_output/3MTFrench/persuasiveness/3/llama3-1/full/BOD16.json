Take the example of soil, where there are up to a billion in a single gram. And in stories, it's the same thing. Diatoms are like wings, unique and lunate, and they live in great numbers. The stories, that is, the part of the river between land and sea, are an accumulation zone for sediments, sands, and clays. To live in community within these stories, diatoms produce a gel composed of large molecules. But it's there that things get interesting, this gel presents many roles. It allows them to stick together, send each other signals, and even send signals to other microorganisms. It doesn't just protect itself against external attacks, but also helps to fix itself on the sediments at the surface of the riverbanks. But how? And well, that's the main question of my thesis. How can this gel interact with the sediments in these stories? You'll ask why study this? Well, the results show that a certain proportion of the gel in the sediments allows for increased cohesion and greatly limits erosion. So, how to understand the role of this gel? I somehow found out that it's like making a recipe, but backwards. You have the final verdict, and you need to repeat it. Our recipe is the chocolate mousse of diatoms from the estuary. First, our ingredients: our gel, our sands, and our clays. Problem. Our gel is a complex assembly of molecules. Just like eggs, we need to prepare it. Study it using colorimetric tests. In short. This means that the color of the test reflects the presence of certain compounds, such as proteins. And once our ingredients are measured, to reproduce this natural phenomenon in the lab, all we have to do is cook our mousse. But the challenge, our gel, our sands, and our clays. Then, see if the recipe worked by taking pictures of the phenomenon. Not with your phone, but with a machine that's not much bigger. An electron microscope. It allows us to take photos of very small objects. Imagine. 100,000 times smaller than your phone. And the photomicrographs will allow us to prove that our set works. The gel fixes and sticks between the sands and clays. What becomes of it? Our mousse, diatoms' perfect. Now, understanding how the gel interacts with the sediments is more arduous. Just like cooking, we succeed in the recipe, but explaining how the eggs work together is another story. And that's what the next objectives of my thesis will be. And this is a face of numerous perspectives for fighting against the problems of erosion in estuaries. I told you. Microorganisms are everywhere around us. And despite their small size, they shouldn't be neglected for their impact on our environment. And maybe even in our kitchen.\n\nÉCHELLE: 1=pas du tout persuasif à 5=très persuasif\n\nDIMENSION: Persuasion of the discourse is evaluated based on its effectiveness in conveying a message and
