{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-28T16:10:06.358730832Z","response":"Based on the provided transcription, I would evaluate the performance as follows:\n\nDIMENSION = [To your opinion, what is the degree of persuasion of this discourse, i.e., whether the person effectively writes a convincing message? Is their reasoning rigorous?]\n\nI would rate the degree of persuasion as 4 out of 5. The speaker presents a clear and passionate argument about the importance of addressing the needs of students who are struggling with writing, highlighting the paradoxical situation where these students are often pushed away from a regular education due to their difficulties. The speaker's reasoning is rigorous, as they provide concrete examples and anecdotes to illustrate their points.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score (5) is that some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make them harder to follow. Additionally, there are a few places where the language is slightly vague or imprecise, such as when the speaker says \"concretement\" without specifying what they mean by this.\n\nOverall, however, I believe the speaker's message is clear, convincing, and well-supported by their examples and reasoning.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,6502,18757,48908,665,342,665,4725,11,27549,296,26248,22011,11,23128,39043,1028,628,1339,9517,56854,1826,54312,1744,9964,439,6316,8735,949,14465,91507,20028,2536,6502,21965,1880,27549,757,326,26248,42676,27584,3678,64591,13,622,34155,11083,11091,978,85938,11,4864,66517,2852,1744,409,1208,4809,451,1880,3930,16081,3122,69,13,622,65948,2852,5906,39043,66021,1744,503,49152,2852,6502,21965,60020,13,1252,220,23,87,11,220,17,87,11,220,16,11,220,18,342,11,4864,841,94297,6502,3625,9859,1195,13080,9189,71751,409,51743,7987,68,1841,1208,38317,296,98279,2972,951,9859,409,2082,7930,40192,79738,28130,22939,13,34447,3625,550,10610,7085,1880,3625,2145,1154,1880,3625,33013,4558,2396,3930,326,3418,8047,12140,45506,15132,57485,3869,1647,1560,40807,8065,4545,39723,4864,9189,41380,2852,5066,1220,294,6,306,2171,3675,13,62463,60014,100063,33013,4558,2396,11,272,17771,934,41901,846,22299,3625,53051,306,3625,1080,645,11,3846,15132,33670,16968,951,51516,11,22299,9189,1880,41091,326,49152,2439,24560,11,22299,389,25692,23761,35597,1370,86633,13,24703,7930,17317,22011,49733,272,17771,1744,22299,48488,409,33013,4558,2396,409,326,3418,8047,4913,64829,11,46152,308,6,546,6502,2665,13532,1208,1488,20712,59471,3869,6316,40134,13,81245,14848,94381,318,978,1880,28068,978,7010,20662,1488,20712,7930,1437,13559,48488,409,26365,1291,1880,7591,745,13,5186,12416,6316,9781,585,42827,71151,3678,447,8047,1370,514,2579,1222,479,6033,514,7591,444,331,3538,1400,12339,13,2009,1370,2172,8536,11,272,17771,1744,272,17771,1120,1133,3869,5353,409,28130,5107,978,3869,326,6,20243,1018,11,7930,308,6,546,6502,18757,48908,7010,1208,1488,20712,7930,274,53149,6853,4725,11,272,17771,3869,13510,665,513,95959,46680,46140,13,19421,41091,7643,9131,11,272,17771,409,46524,8065,30517,6316,77818,1880,409,7643,88818,294,6,266,68249,9517,67,1335,64829,7930,1826,27389,46790,1370,28130,91558,63934,13327,409,18488,409,28130,80980,463,11,653,91116,294,58591,73511,15171,28130,5178,3869,326,6,20243,1018,13,34447,8065,48226,6496,11,46524,653,91116,409,3625,9517,41546,321,1291,9952,514,55467,11,9952,326,6,20243,1018,11,1880,9952,326,31769,56745,13,19421,28463,46524,653,91116,409,9517,62219,6316,2217,71151,7591,6902,8047,934,35329,56311,39929,409,27584,13,1221,846,79507,11,503,34155,81621,6316,76132,9952,951,33013,4558,2396,1880,951,68061,625,1821,3930,326,3418,8047,56578,45506,11,3869,3625,22842,11,3869,3625,958,299,1414,11,10071,28463,3869,8678,805,43153,91329,24143,13,27058,10045,261,6316,3057,1557,281,15433,55180,2428,7930,274,53149,84,648,1765,28130,1486,12108,11,12541,2249,272,17771,781,625,978,951,55744,8467,2515,22589,409,37417,11,5019,1744,3625,68061,625,1821,15132,665,961,514,5636,51794,479,3284,13,16062,1765,84921,665,1794,2727,13,33150,48226,6496,409,3846,42775,409,81098,7829,11,514,45165,23349,7591,10188,11,272,96287,409,10045,261,1880,409,38211,653,58551,333,7930,5043,97820,3930,42775,1765,1208,96282,665,71686,220,868,76145,11,10071,28463,1765,1208,23878,13109,409,326,6,19010,79351,3869,19477,52750,951,1495,288,1317,82,1880,71185,978,8135,82,11,1880,1765,829,23878,13109,3869,60946,265,11,8678,805,1880,4046,838,8977,20662,69067,1880,513,409,15907,97686,3536,13,2009,12366,11,272,17771,1744,665,58673,484,519,1208,75332,768,91329,1269,7010,43905,829,6485,13109,11,389,11412,29557,10367,10253,33013,4558,2396,409,5790,283,261,9952,1208,84788,635,1156,8083,556,13,445,6,3042,684,11,272,17771,1744,27750,33013,4558,2396,15890,503,6,434,1155,2852,409,757,20028,3625,1080,7561,2249,75804,88253,11,63414,2486,467,3869,43453,11,20028,69379,265,28130,60020,13,17971,55152,11,7930,43989,1370,978,1678,514,5636,78422,532,951,45973,11,23423,1339,1744,16968,514,38900,1826,6892,10610,648,11,10071,4502,9189,4046,26591,1339,653,3273,49363,1765,829,23878,13109,3869,44517,716,10253,59588,417,11,5019,10025,16339,409,25400,71751,514,27065,294,93825,91132,579,13,1708,1105,11,5019,41091,11,1208,5636,25626,51913,635,42827,11,8065,25646,409,56321,8261,11,272,17771,409,3625,69379,265,35073,13510,1744,54613,308,17771,293,37093,11,1880,1744,16968,514,38900,25692,379,2961,1553,665,66517,519,951,9045,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,
