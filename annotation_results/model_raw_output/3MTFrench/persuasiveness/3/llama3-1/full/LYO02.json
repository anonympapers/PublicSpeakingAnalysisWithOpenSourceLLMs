The speaker jumps between different ideas and examples without fully summarizing their main point or providing a clear takeaway message. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make them harder to follow.\n\nOverall, however, I think the speaker does an excellent job of using storytelling, analogy, and vivid imagery to convey their message in a way that is engaging and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,3665,89,11,3625,48577,7930,14848,1208,8811,329,648,294,6,2149,42360,11,27549,308,6,1138,535,5636,3869,14707,274,6,15226,261,13,46408,513,41518,7010,28130,83187,3073,685,13,34447,17317,11,4068,1826,54312,934,54386,18728,1339,5019,513,38831,15170,7010,29449,3073,685,665,20272,949,356,17771,19227,1001,7138,75,934,54386,841,513,84295,49606,79507,13,1952,1860,648,1744,7010,3625,35603,409,29449,3073,685,11,15878,21965,513,1153,261,409,4860,13,7777,11,1370,51173,11,70374,33670,409,96586,49733,11,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,66517,1339,47838,14896,13,42215,308,26248,55455,3869,46131,9952,3846,7930,513,1522,275,49733,13,19421,42676,389,961,275,3869,294,6,3457,11,389,6348,64,26725,67807,84,84595,79071,14896,294,49455,265,7010,29449,17536,13,1611,1208,27584,85722,1744,29449,34922,11,3846,7591,2050,7010,653,1560,1330,64441,11,40321,978,409,39381,409,293,64272,3904,409,71632,7010,514,43014,3900,25692,48908,1880,19443,404,13,44564,2389,5397,11,3846,7591,2050,294,22827,1560,1330,10723,40321,978,409,924,75004,409,23423,8047,11,409,719,11,294,6,9035,13109,11,294,6,90446,7010,514,43014,27549,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,409,3460,288,6179,5512,96642,2018,3159,5512,7930,513,14425,79738,1880,7930,513,67807,84,81541,3869,30517,514,27138,13,356,17771,2018,3159,978,7010,1208,88265,29449,1560,40807,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,272,17771,2018,3159,978,1744,326,54386,2322,665,18579,1880,1744,514,1323,716,519,5636,62197,13,4366,86633,11,48488,5636,62197,11,42676,389,38831,83384,653,52827,934,54386,308,26248,6502,33614,41199,951,65838,11,1370,51173,11,272,17771,3846,1765,1744,653,51655,409,42775,13,622,6,26577,648,409,60946,265,4068,389,20272,5019,18434,265,951,17536,7010,514,76354,44351,12569,261,1880,1218,1864,301,978,7010,514,27138,13,12535,389,20272,5019,18434,265,51854,98385,17536,32118,5317,14014,7010,6316,27584,17536,665,79071,80444,949,622,34155,16968,22011,26725,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,21063,11,409,32118,97495,11,57459,665,51655,7010,1208,59471,409,15907,2018,3159,5512,11,409,15907,98385,17536,13,27058,3846,20028,11,4864,14843,285,653,4046,331,63497,3869,9517,1072,635,1208,88452,409,29449,17536,3869,30517,951,70175,57146,1744,4864,390,708,285,13,34447,13324,28068,306,653,5636,10878,4864,834,58139,519,46777,51655,91678,519,6316,2018,3159,978,13,65381,31632,409,326,22827,11,4864,14951,1130,951,1719,75104,5019,85114,4502,388,3625,70175,1880,4864,84921,1208,23878,13109,951,13324,409,274,6,20311,10253,2609,3808,409,70175,11,409,3846,98395,11,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,11,409,513,22040,1430,7010,514,18111,324,1880,409,28130,21063,3930,27138,13,80905,39043,5019,60946,265,4068,64972,45712,261,48901,951,32118,4919,2191,288,409,29449,272,5976,2933,11,1744,3846,45441,5019,64972,342,52424,1208,6485,13109,14425,24918,409,12155,17536,5019,59148,13206,6316,1218,2827,43711,9379,344,13109,6033,5019,64972,60946,265,76076,52088,66474,665,27138,13,1952,25692,25945,14707,18434,265,1880,9465,59976,265,84871,84871,409,79165,15878,60019,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,13,24703,308,17771,6502,100243,13,19421,9465,17317,11,272,17771,42676,27584,79380,57625,42676,389,379,1208,9517,1517,978,331,275,13,11842,13,1611,29449,81337,11,4502,389,264,951,9234,69898,409,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,13,27058,1081,20099,3869,18434,265,11,389,44521,1339,56316,59062,978,1880,389,841,35737,6502,39015,13,4366,346,1744,272,17771,42676,27584,40970,11,389,42182,513,4865,3913,1208,83067,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,653,57677,6672,13,64105,64,11412,13510,11,4502,389,17782,3869,20028,11,16968,3846,934,54386,17782,3869,20028,13,15089,60946,265,4068,389,20272,13,34447,13085,89,3846,934,54386,92215,20028,13,12095,389,60946,64972,11,16968,3846,7930,513,39904,39015,2902,2784,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,4999,198,6153,42118,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,98224,5573,315,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,627,198,8586,596,3249,1473,9,578,19114,8638,555,11821,264,4443,50750,1295,922,1274,449,44531,596,8624,11,902,8779,311,5813,48451,323,11705,264,3717,449,279,10877,13,198,9,2435,1243,1005,459,56203,320,884,45252,1057,14209,311,35603
