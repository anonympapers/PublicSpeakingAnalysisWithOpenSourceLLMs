{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-29T13:57:36.730327957Z","response":"Based on the TRANSCRIPT, I would rate the persuasion level of this discourse as 2 out of 5. Here's why:\n\nThe speaker's argumentation is somewhat confusing and lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow their reasoning. The repetition of phrases such as \"I think that I'm not a part of the woman who makes the same thing\" creates a sense of circular thinking rather than building a convincing case. Additionally, the introduction of seemingly unrelated elements, like mentioning a piece of chalk against one's pocket and eye, adds to the overall confusion.\n\nThe speaker does express uncertainty and self-doubt, which may resonate with some listeners, but this is not enough to establish a strong persuasive message. Overall, the discourse lacks logical coherence, making it hard for the audience to accept the speaker's claims.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,103846,2383,64,11,2383,64,11,2383,64,11,21143,1666,6733,912,912,11,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,1102,596,4228,369,757,311,656,433,11,719,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,13,3277,358,2019,430,11,1606,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,11,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,9393,358,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,13,9393,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,9393,358,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,13,2030,358,1781,430,422,358,656,433,11,433,1053,15187,4287,856,9021,13,5112,358,3619,1268,2574,690,387,2884,13,358,1781,358,1541,956,617,264,3254,893,430,1102,596,682,358,1205,311,656,13,3277,499,8521,757,11,499,3463,430,358,4265,4018,433,304,1403,9863,13,499,3463,430,358,4265,4018,1578,264,6710,13,2100,358,1436,5622,499,449,264,22145,13,264,6710,315,43459,2403,856,18301,323,856,8071,13,362,1474,587,301,11,56270,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,41986,336,587,301,11,42065,8886,11450,13,6914,279,5015,584,11,358,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,41447,25823,11,358,1053,4478,279,98224,2237,315,420,41602,439,220,17,704,315,220,20,13,5810,596,3249,512,198,791,19114,596,5811,367,374,14738,31715,323,37856,32373,11,3339,433,5107,311,1833,872,33811,13,578,54515,315,32847,1778,439,330,40,1781,430,358,2846,539,264,961,315,279,5333,889,3727,279,1890,3245,1,11705,264,5647,315,28029,7422,4856,1109,4857,264,40661,1162,13,23212,11,279,17219,315,23490,46305,5540,11,1093,45391,264,6710,315,43459,2403,832,596,18301,323,8071,11,11621,311,279,8244,22047,627,198,791,19114,1587,3237,27924,323,659,1773,5599,83,11,902,1253,89986,449,1063,24475,11,719,420,374,539,3403,311,5813,264,3831,66343,1984,13,28993,11,279,41602,37856,20406,78925,11,3339,433,2653,369,279,10877,311,4287,279,19114,596,8349,13,128009],"total_duration":114019286177,"load_duration":148679,"prompt_eval_count":805,"prompt_eval_duration":89495958000,"eval_count":164,"eval_duration":24522557000}
