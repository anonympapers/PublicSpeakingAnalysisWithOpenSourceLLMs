Unfortunately, in addition to the physical toll it takes on your body, it also affects your immune system and can lead to side effects for the patient. One way to address this issue would be to use a technique that only targets cancer cells when they're present and not affect healthy cells. We could use our immune system's soldiers, antibodies. When we're ill, our immune system creates and deploys small molecules, antibodies, which are soldiers that recognize specific threats and eliminate them. In the case of cancer, these cells don't change their behavior and our body doesn't build up immunity to them. Injected into the organism, these soldiers only recognize cancer cells as a threat after treatment, even if new ones arise. But if we provide them with an additional weapon, capable of killing cancer cells using toxic molecules, we would have redoubtable soldiers.\n\nTRANSCRIPT (CONTINUED):\n\nToday, we're capable of finishing arms and soldiers. We've developed various methods to do so. However, we don't have control over the number of lives we give them or where they are situated. They can serve in their hands, package or even butt. Despite these unknowns, our arms and soldiers, although somewhat disorganized, still achieve the same level of effectiveness. Finally, you say your arms were multiplied, becoming stronger than ever before. A soldier without arms would have a problem from the start. But a soldier with too many arms would slow down and never arrive at cancer.\n\nTRANSCRIPT (CONCLUSION):\n\nSo, my ideal is that each moment should be just right for each soldier. For antibodies, we're in the same situation. And you see the entire challenge of trying to achieve this. We want to develop chemical methods that will allow us to bind precisely 2.6 molecules per antibody cube and generate an army of soldiers that will be much stronger than today's arms.\n\nTRANSCRIPT (CONCLUSION):\n\nConcretely, how do I achieve this? You can see the chemists in their lab coats mixing colors together, but we can't follow a recipe once it's mixed. I'm not like that at all. I work behind closed doors and my gut feeling tells me to try something different. In my lab, I have an antibody that is capable of recognizing and binding to cancer cells. In a short time, I'll test the method with a molecule that is fluorescent and rose-colored. This will allow me to see in one shot whether the action works or not. If the drop remains rose-colored, then it means I've got enough antibodies working. Otherwise, we know it didn't work.\n\nTRANSCRIPT (FINAL):\n\nI make countless tests every day to obtain different soldiers. And maybe one day, I'll arrive at a point where a doctor will be able to tell me that the cancer is gone. So, all you
