{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-29T13:42:55.387990536Z","response":"What a fascinating text!\n\nBased on the TRANSCRIPTION, I can see that the speaker is trying to persuade the audience about the effectiveness of their method for dating human remains using acoustic methods. They present two options: either create the best presentation or eliminate all other competitors.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning seems to be based on the idea that traditional chemical methods are flawed and imprecise, whereas their own acoustic approach is more reliable. They also mention that they have observed similar behavior in police investigations, where ultra-sonic waves can be used to detect human remains.\n\nHowever, I must say that some parts of the text are quite confusing or vague (e.g., \"compression, torsion, six aimes\" - what does this mean?). Additionally, there seems to be a lack of concrete evidence or scientific data to support their claims.\n\nConsidering these points, I would give a score of 2 out of 5 on the Ã‰CHELLE scale. While the speaker is passionate and tries to persuade the audience, the reasoning is not entirely rigorous, and some parts of the text are unclear or unconvincing.\n\nPlease note that this evaluation is based solely on the TRANSCRIPTION provided, without any additional context or information about the performance or the speaker's qualifications.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,362,9832,77492,88253,11,3846,934,54386,9189,62163,11,272,17771,409,90194,1208,94721,57485,367,13,27058,3846,45441,41091,11,4864,100164,26633,2671,13,45441,3869,20028,1208,94721,57485,367,11,45441,1043,48670,26725,3625,46106,35135,82,13,19421,1370,6225,409,27750,86966,1133,4068,9964,1560,26077,447,22827,15878,23761,304,47391,39883,1370,1208,12437,11,3900,8657,275,409,14707,934,81991,46206,514,34922,1880,294,6,57558,265,514,121372,2852,409,65835,13,5034,22866,11,272,17771,653,28800,1208,2457,409,64032,8135,9131,294,58591,42947,11,9952,514,27138,11,3625,864,84,2396,924,288,513,7591,6902,306,4502,14707,42138,220,508,8261,13,4072,645,841,15132,5636,2215,85,4893,77558,653,63992,13,19421,39587,11,1522,5512,951,326,4558,4282,11,4864,36731,41664,4618,13,358,5979,26077,447,22827,71451,514,34922,33670,11,39043,513,4684,2428,653,28800,11,10071,4864,296,52152,47391,66522,6502,21965,13,5034,4379,86032,30808,11412,665,67781,2457,951,1560,936,66692,13,27058,47929,4502,514,121372,2852,409,65835,1826,81621,6033,2536,11,10071,4864,4635,2852,28130,98652,11,272,17771,951,3338,811,38094,8467,1880,84568,893,17187,409,51625,1854,13,19421,97507,11,389,1826,16968,3846,7930,20272,653,13,19421,1208,18528,409,12155,25568,417,11,272,17771,326,54386,47838,16354,11,6033,35597,12155,6183,21237,38450,17724,13,1952,264,951,9467,3095,11,8065,15679,11,12155,17536,31355,4839,1133,409,1208,27584,85722,13,19421,3625,56549,1759,409,3338,811,15132,1370,86633,409,51854,43386,33903,294,6,1036,14014,13,19421,272,17771,1120,1133,39043,11,389,42775,273,13,2998,37622,1744,23008,23008,11,389,513,4160,275,13,356,17771,951,121372,2852,11,1208,4379,264,9517,1072,556,20662,15572,68,951,56549,1759,11,665,68866,519,6316,48659,98652,409,3338,367,14707,5636,51625,285,13,19421,73103,63484,308,17771,6502,38094,2428,11,10071,1645,26169,2428,97507,11,4864,2457,9952,409,1208,89669,13,64105,64,9189,4046,783,818,949,3263,42441,89,3625,3369,1441,1744,1208,274,399,9769,818,13,2998,712,25108,668,409,85434,13,1952,9279,325,13,19421,389,9279,325,6502,26725,409,1208,27584,85722,13,12095,3900,379,18302,48099,1744,95917,359,264,4538,83187,1742,11,39043,12223,1765,1208,281,17194,13,61651,14707,11,5019,11083,259,40493,729,11,665,5589,13,32429,3625,296,3675,11,272,17771,1744,1208,4379,86032,30808,757,3116,7907,1826,296,481,479,13,622,34155,84228,64591,653,52962,1133,1675,10746,556,13,18024,74696,653,3738,955,409,89669,11,665,326,6,14310,21201,951,24955,12,38448,13,7695,513,2322,653,17358,978,13,19421,28130,54409,7986,15132,4502,54008,4918,1744,45602,11,829,2748,68,3869,409,1208,9279,325,13,46706,3846,9517,79,62704,2847,288,11,4671,2058,1339,13,1952,17477,409,56321,12678,934,54386,917,6853,26168,13,350,1105,290,1880,4848,264,1769,13,67261,11,95560,290,11,4848,264,1769,11,46777,2709,325,3869,4538,1742,409,9279,325,13,64105,64,85722,409,9517,351,404,10253,24955,12,38448,13,1952,917,6853,39043,829,12223,1645,26169,2428,13,622,6,306,1438,46939,3625,282,10515,2227,288,294,6,404,283,1441,11,10071,41091,4864,308,41901,36731,6502,24068,321,11,39043,264,6883,978,719,409,57992,8047,13,220,19,11,20,76145,3930,5634,1880,272,17771,83195,13,445,57286,266,3930,9279,325,324,513,9517,85,51453,3869,30517,39043,7010,3846,7930,767,648,13,24703,326,54386,3288,8065,29210,2119,17060,648,39723,15132,14240,266,8834,343,1157,13,19421,14707,3869,1208,9279,325,294,22827,2709,325,11,272,17771,28463,33632,978,71,729,978,1370,76076,1719,75104,22299,1208,7138,3930,83259,39723,3900,264,19266,73,3514,978,11,39723,514,27138,7930,1208,1522,1339,32592,88026,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,1120,1133,409,757,503,7889,326,52152,41116,409,3846,27138,294,41901,69,283,50753,39723,37622,1772,90653,336,1765,1208,12223,1645,26169,2428,294,22827,2709,325,54401,409,68226,665,54606,514,3338,978,5019,51625,12329,13,2998,45889,3460,288,11,4864,28068,68,8065,2307,8437,579,324,409,51651,9279,325,13,356,17771,25400,7930,92215,13510,653,2709,325,7930,264,653,4865,294,6,23604,519,829,85722,409,9279,325,13,19421,3869,76420,39015,1481,300,11,3900,379,264,49733,13,350,77025,60019,779,258,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128
