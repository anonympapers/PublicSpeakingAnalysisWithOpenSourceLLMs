{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-29T16:25:43.487288769Z","response":"Based on the TRANSCRIPT, I evaluate the performance as follows:\n\nThe speaker starts with a poetic description of New Orleans and jazz music, which sets a creative tone. However, they then shift gears to discuss their experience in surgery and how it relates to music.\n\nThe reasoning is not entirely rigorous, as the speaker jumps between different ideas without providing clear connections or evidence to support their claims. While some of the analogies are interesting (e.g., comparing surgeons to musicians), others feel forced or unclear.\n\nThe overall tone is engaging, with a conversational style that makes the listener want to learn more. However, the lack of clear structure and transitions between ideas detracts from the persuasiveness of the message.\n\nAccordingly, I score this performance as 3 out of 5 on the Ã‰CHELLE (persuasion scale), indicating that while the speaker is creative and engaging, their reasoning could be more rigorous and structured to effectively convey their message.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,949,356,17771,3869,1208,48659,477,69328,598,13,5034,39973,409,1208,89669,13,5034,39973,3930,34997,13,41621,308,6,57558,10333,949,39783,65636,79,6672,13,46408,1826,665,5542,294,22827,80163,978,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,6316,281,5615,1557,11,6316,47838,81613,13,5034,89669,274,69537,19010,12339,5636,12108,11,5636,83457,11,5636,62321,13,46408,9189,665,60172,11,27549,274,6,3239,337,1339,11,27549,9189,41518,13,46408,54606,818,1765,15907,281,9011,2392,13,5034,65636,79,6672,1826,13034,569,100162,13,2009,270,25253,12717,13,39783,270,25253,7643,25108,376,15760,13,39783,270,25253,13550,978,71,2711,409,1208,89669,13,7695,308,59858,264,6502,409,6367,13,64105,64,86100,934,6,88423,409,326,6,306,969,25108,40280,13,1611,326,6,306,969,25108,40280,1826,1131,29749,259,6,300,2536,949,393,46396,13,14465,757,824,5469,13,14465,841,63762,6502,3930,16968,409,89669,13,14465,42775,273,7010,1208,71546,5673,648,13,350,788,3625,49301,11,4864,100164,951,60120,71546,5673,552,7930,15132,665,5542,653,1208,274,481,479,7930,9517,79,66522,35597,1880,35597,3625,123299,9004,13033,288,11,3625,123299,9004,665,6583,25108,40280,13,81245,14848,20662,39143,11,20662,38317,1880,20662,74772,768,13,1219,2727,951,3167,3457,729,13,3489,438,4864,7591,5924,11,4864,864,77,2852,951,45369,409,2092,3716,1220,11,4864,9189,11357,67763,13,622,53149,79717,1208,35019,339,76,2428,11,3625,9192,2727,11,4864,66517,2852,3930,7591,331,333,48468,13,622,53149,79717,3625,10074,645,13,622,34155,11083,6502,3930,16968,39043,13,34447,7970,11,42138,9964,6800,285,13,19421,9964,60946,82,1744,514,2092,64965,11,272,17771,653,46110,78422,532,5019,3625,3167,3457,729,13,356,17771,3869,28130,917,9484,265,514,16287,44618,13,19421,272,17771,6316,2307,76385,2908,5019,58673,15610,40126,13,2998,71546,5673,648,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,20662,76385,2908,13,24971,409,13612,3716,1220,13,1708,1105,41091,11,503,34155,7591,21200,978,294,31769,68019,514,2092,3716,1220,409,1208,95234,1880,3930,13033,68,71546,5673,648,934,80720,17537,5118,1339,3869,1208,89385,10390,285,1317,8047,3930,18003,278,13,4418,66,39015,11,9189,9189,23933,10333,4068,71546,5673,648,13,74656,16006,978,13,14465,36731,51307,7711,13,14465,42775,273,9952,951,71546,5673,552,11,27467,12558,2734,1133,13,19421,17317,58673,484,2439,1765,951,72886,409,71546,5673,648,9517,301,13,62463,46681,72886,17317,41675,3869,27389,3826,1208,60128,3930,13033,68,71546,5673,648,934,80720,264,326,26248,579,294,22827,15730,5746,635,757,294,53149,8135,1056,425,13,1219,2727,20662,15730,5746,635,4046,1074,12267,11,3900,757,29557,409,75871,265,3869,6316,26633,90272,3488,13,11876,447,2053,409,27750,44827,72886,15132,3625,5636,62623,288,5019,3327,72684,1208,60128,3930,13033,68,71546,5673,648,934,80720,13,622,34155,294,58591,73511,7769,9465,11083,46681,72886,1880,1208,60128,13,2998,51092,11,9952,514,71546,5673,648,11,17317,958,652,978,35511,9400,81235,27750,4398,1880,3846,15132,3625,6954,4918,100246,11,3625,6954,4918,83229,86709,294,22827,43453,2092,3716,1220,409,1208,71546,5673,648,13,33150,1620,11,4502,9189,62299,3167,3457,268,11,9189,62299,17634,81,5512,9024,479,514,2092,3716,1220,5019,514,80410,11,10071,39043,9189,29557,2221,409,64972,100196,13,1611,1208,27584,85722,11,514,71546,5673,3675,4046,6323,404,2473,4538,83187,2092,3716,1220,5019,64972,5916,261,1880,779,78756,4538,11939,13,3341,326,6,434,306,13327,11,665,32118,8332,483,11,513,42182,44093,23761,514,11939,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,41447,25823,11,358,15806,279,5178,439,11263,512,198,791,19114,8638,449,264,76534,4096,315,1561,27008,323,34997,4731,11,902,7437,264,11782,16630,13,4452,11,814,1243,6541,54260,311,4358,872,3217,304,15173,323,1268,433,36716,311,4731,627,198,791,33811,374,539,11622,47999,11,439,279,19114,35308,1990,2204,6848,2085,8405,2867,13537,477,6029,311,1862,872,8349,13,6104,1063,315,279,24291,552,527,7185,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,74272,311,32629,705,3885,2733,9770,477,25420,627,198,791,8244,16630,374,23387,11,449,264,7669,1697,1742,430,3727,279,11700,1390,311,4048,810,13,4452,11,279,6996,315,2867,6070,323,34692,1990,6848,35453,11613,505,279,24613
