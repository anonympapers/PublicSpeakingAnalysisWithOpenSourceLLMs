{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-29T17:40:41.120762023Z","response":"Based on the transcription, I would evaluate the persuasion level of the discourse as follows:\n\nDIMENSION: 4 (Somewhat persuasive)\n\nTÂCHE: 4\n\nThe speaker presents their thesis with conviction and enthusiasm, using rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"il me regarde\", \"je le regarde\") to engage the audience. The use of vivid imagery (\"le côté pil de la pièce\", \"la face cachée\") helps to illustrate complex concepts, making them more accessible to the listener.\n\nThe speaker also shows a good understanding of their topic, using academic terminology and referencing specific historical events (e.g., \"au 19e siècle\"). However, some parts of the discourse could be improved:\n\n* The language is sometimes overly simplistic or colloquial (\"ce qui m'intéresse dans la deuxième partie de ma tête\", \"Ok, je suis dans ma poche\"), which may detract from the overall persuasiveness.\n* Some ideas are not fully developed or supported by evidence, making them seem less convincing (e.g., the claim that modernity is impossible without coloniality).\n* The speaker's tone is sometimes too casual or informal (\"Un autre verre?\"), which may not be suitable for a formal presentation.\n\nOverall, I would give the discourse a score of 4 out of 5 on the persuasion scale.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,426,1116,11,503,6,30992,2428,2852,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,31769,2629,285,3869,356,8039,89577,4821,265,11,665,75878,829,463,1557,11,389,2624,1088,11,3900,757,62163,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,1208,17536,13,19421,4502,389,9964,66517,75249,7010,1208,17536,949,14465,75871,82,4864,66517,6316,270,4558,325,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,13,7695,3625,433,333,3900,308,59858,264,6502,7631,978,13,19421,27549,1826,1765,75249,9637,270,4558,325,949,14465,75871,82,13,8242,3625,842,343,4558,4978,409,1208,393,23465,1880,409,1208,7281,6241,648,11,665,1417,27970,13,7695,20272,4538,2840,57531,92759,978,11,3900,757,62163,951,51625,6948,13,7695,274,55624,978,22550,13,7777,11,4864,36731,7010,7643,3273,1557,11,39043,66167,6316,70477,346,11,4864,757,86345,13,2998,20272,11,3625,2624,2530,1765,514,463,911,12416,11,514,82620,11,3625,91225,575,811,11,15132,22299,514,81337,11715,409,1208,70477,346,13,24703,934,54386,11412,917,8023,39015,6617,13109,13,356,17771,3846,1744,326,54386,17317,20605,265,11,272,17771,1744,326,54386,4160,275,33670,16968,13,34447,326,58736,17194,52842,42625,514,5553,519,409,20662,70477,346,11,1744,9964,3567,1572,11,10071,7930,308,17771,6502,9621,7010,326,6,12828,978,8747,266,13,62408,3663,61387,8047,71925,6960,326,6,454,4099,11,326,52152,809,2521,8082,11,1208,55949,409,76076,28800,13,24703,934,54386,11412,917,8023,39015,37683,13109,13,1611,85722,13509,1604,11,20662,70477,346,7891,285,8047,514,38900,1880,829,1515,2428,409,34501,40280,13,7695,841,25692,379,39929,409,6617,13109,15878,37683,13109,13,362,31632,409,3846,20272,11,41091,11,503,6,44803,325,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,20662,1515,2428,294,94572,15273,75,7010,514,719,409,60946,265,4068,1208,6617,13109,264,5293,978,3869,326,31769,4763,2617,64441,409,3738,288,14121,355,1880,326,31769,4763,2617,7891,2428,951,46106,665,1417,27970,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,13,7695,296,6,20243,2182,11,3900,296,6,20243,2182,6502,11,272,17771,514,296,20243,2182,13,14465,3136,13,2998,51092,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,7010,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,7643,83067,513,15132,3625,78167,1495,65832,13,622,6,49133,22299,3625,69483,61480,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,7930,7591,5192,1924,3625,1280,343,4558,4978,11,389,4790,9425,27750,26633,2267,85460,13,2998,20272,11,4864,514,63762,1744,294,6,16288,6316,85722,294,31769,5192,404,77580,15235,20487,11,951,78199,11,951,270,66474,11,951,12678,409,1742,11,951,15082,11,951,77617,3946,3869,55056,978,11,951,5554,2436,7930,5891,72,89810,51854,37291,7010,1647,43194,13,19421,7930,15132,57705,978,2889,8467,409,20662,1515,2428,1744,503,34155,7591,5589,285,665,2773,804,48901,13,7695,20272,665,13033,68,11,503,6,1138,37093,4272,11,3900,35456,653,802,6733,556,40852,953,11,3900,757,62163,87320,503,34155,2665,13532,409,58673,15610,1765,3846,70927,13,622,34155,75871,13,622,34155,55162,10036,48021,665,41263,20712,1208,6617,13109,11,1208,37683,13109,409,29449,38900,11,7010,514,719,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,1765,3625,1615,978,45045,3435,8467,1880,3608,275,17724,11,2995,408,43711,1370,3625,2624,2530,294,98279,50889,288,55398,81991,12155,49301,13,2009,39474,409,326,22827,332,2515,28674,220,679,17,11,61158,6853,1744,17317,308,41901,57038,6502,1913,72,9952,1208,9349,42345,978,8637,2428,11,1208,9517,4099,1880,1208,21934,294,35329,342,5615,331,1339,45973,3625,2477,24292,266,22589,13,2009,719,409,7643,83067,1826,1913,54960,409,23008,9211,45889,9517,23475,7010,514,81621,5019,64972,60946,265,1208,6671,1180,31037,409,4502,1081,3928,978,7930,63922,668,44093,409,274,59858,1645,566,391,38149,5019,20028,5201,261,28130,64079,11,3663,8065,85182,40280,1880,8065,69026,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,326,6,269,7515,451,11,4864,326,6,269,7515,451,11,3900,22011,11,23128,6033,2852,11,92759,519,13,1252,47838,2807,265,30,426,1116,11,503,34155,9071,978,294,6,30992,72684,7643,83067,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,46940,11,358,1053,15806,279,98224,2237,315,279,41602,439,11263,512,198,76219,24557,25,220,19,320,50982,81575,66343,340,198,51,33895,44893,25,220,19,198,198,791,19114,18911,872,17850,44
