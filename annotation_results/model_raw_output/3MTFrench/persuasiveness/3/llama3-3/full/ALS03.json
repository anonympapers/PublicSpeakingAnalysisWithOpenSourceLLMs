The speaker explains that just like Chiarat's body processes food into energy and waste, cities and territories have their own metabolism, processing resources and transforming them into goods and services.\n\nThe speaker then describes how, as a geographer, they are interested in studying the metabolism of territories, which involves understanding how resources are mobilized, transformed, and consumed. The speaker notes that this is a complex task, requiring large amounts of data to be collected and analyzed.\n\nThe speaker also mentions their work on developing methods to simplify the study of territorial metabolism, using computer programs to manipulate and analyze large datasets. The goal is to create tools that will allow for more effective management of resources and sustainable economic development.\n\n**ÉCHELLE**\n\nI would rate this discourse a 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasion. The speaker presents their ideas clearly and convincingly, using an engaging example (Chiarat the dog) to illustrate complex concepts. The speaker's reasoning is generally sound, and they provide some specific examples to support their arguments.\n\n**DIMENSION**\n\nThe dimension of persuasion refers to the extent to which the discourse effectively persuades or convinces the audience of its claims. In this case, I believe the speaker presents their ideas in a clear and convincing manner, using persuasive language and logical reasoning to build their argument. The only area where they may not be entirely successful is in providing specific examples to support their claims about territorial metabolism, which might require more concrete data or evidence.\n\n**TÂCHE**\n\nBased on my evaluation of the discourse, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for persuasion.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,41901,4039,1604,409,83491,648,11,6316,38920,523,349,7930,274,53149,6853,921,13884,266,13,921,13884,266,11,4864,25400,21559,26725,3625,49301,50026,220,1135,69225,288,409,14425,52806,13,39783,37291,653,342,52424,11,15907,14425,24181,2392,82133,513,43678,7010,4538,2942,44618,1880,3127,52424,3625,10184,6417,812,1880,3625,4046,39624,552,934,80720,687,72,89810,5019,25400,29557,10367,409,2800,261,8065,1948,409,829,57128,13,362,1208,1913,3930,1920,355,11,3900,66167,45889,7591,331,1441,1744,921,13884,266,1826,9467,84,32592,57128,409,38920,272,5646,13,5034,10484,13109,294,83508,3904,3869,342,52424,11,1208,76407,15890,3900,513,5276,68,7010,326,6,8629,44618,1880,3846,7930,665,594,7003,11,16968,39043,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,514,32118,6323,337,44618,294,22827,2942,44618,13,34447,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,88704,68,13,14465,308,34155,9964,22011,6502,3625,47120,288,18434,1821,13,14465,36731,74672,540,4714,383,1880,503,34155,9964,22011,951,7317,6491,3946,11,951,26886,645,11,951,38682,919,11,951,21935,13,19421,27584,4502,27750,7317,6491,3946,308,6,546,6502,6800,14896,3869,46131,9952,921,13884,266,11,46152,14848,84440,28463,653,32118,6323,337,44618,13,38891,89,6316,39973,22299,653,25500,10065,7010,514,43014,17317,829,324,919,26725,665,79071,80444,951,13509,2482,13,19421,14707,5019,1744,3846,25500,10065,13458,326,6,29116,68976,44829,325,34501,1215,11,272,17771,3869,13510,5019,1744,3625,4635,327,1800,3233,17317,3567,546,29905,12329,951,594,40751,11,951,453,12843,3930,66304,11,3930,281,10515,5898,11,951,32118,2629,2249,11,5099,2637,5099,13,48109,841,893,331,2439,4046,1325,336,479,6502,60019,40744,27750,594,40751,11,10071,17317,3625,1615,316,24483,11,3625,5276,2439,1880,3625,436,2784,82,10390,1395,11,16968,22299,921,13884,266,11,934,54386,1794,2727,11,5276,68,1880,938,73,6672,27750,14425,24181,2392,13,12095,4864,5320,2249,47929,3846,1744,921,13884,266,934,54386,1794,2727,11,272,17771,308,17771,6502,25945,77411,13,7695,8657,275,409,1153,261,27750,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,11,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,80720,841,60534,55455,294,49455,265,665,61387,6672,13,34447,5019,47929,3846,1744,934,54386,1794,2727,6033,938,73,6672,528,14081,67763,11,1208,259,9011,1557,1826,47838,479,5636,6485,68,11,1880,3900,379,264,48488,11,48488,409,46681,3869,51010,36501,13,5034,5788,40574,292,1286,11,326,58736,27523,1332,12339,11,3625,938,73,118904,31539,326,6,1334,5553,326,93847,11,1208,57459,665,7591,14215,11,514,7710,409,15572,438,5014,11,1880,14707,294,49455,265,13,9648,2426,11,43905,5634,20712,2389,2159,361,11,3846,15132,51854,43386,33903,409,11990,409,52021,7930,4319,29580,46777,76132,1765,653,7317,6491,556,22299,326,6,2149,89,1394,13,362,32384,11,1647,42775,1826,409,52895,716,3625,75601,2601,7930,17634,306,5636,4382,1880,5636,51794,11,326,57286,799,3930,32118,6323,337,44618,409,12155,7317,6491,3946,11,665,29557,61512,409,51010,36501,1880,294,6,69331,2058,40744,27750,46681,13,27058,45602,11,389,6141,3357,324,1339,653,4958,84048,25945,8791,458,13,5186,12416,39929,3608,90859,514,955,294,6,26125,934,35329,47090,14951,8646,11,1880,52895,716,653,18629,7591,8747,978,11,4864,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,26125,13,356,8458,757,29557,409,75871,265,5636,51794,479,3869,96642,4860,3869,31632,409,46681,1437,2142,11,7930,4747,306,6033,312,15769,409,75249,11,6033,42676,11,1880,665,45889,1218,35933,13,14465,1446,2192,653,294,57286,275,3675,7930,76605,48021,7930,40142,8065,38682,547,11,4864,757,1153,261,2192,3625,123299,9004,4860,11,10071,3846,308,17771,6502,7930,264,9024,934,35329,47090,48021,8065,38682,547,13,24703,15132,14707,539,978,29141,3946,7930,4747,306,21965,409,594,40751,665,16968,4865,5636,1744,3846,1744,1208,3197,66522,841,25692,5790,283,899,261,13,362,32384,11,9952,1647,42775,11,503,6,25632,12339,75831,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,653,43453,36252,1291,294,58736,1601,13,39783,80444,409,1891,10515,275,3675,3930,7317,6491,556,11,7930,46524,64,514,38682,547,3869,294,53149,8023,5019,1744,29449,82653,648,44829,325,2018,8977,3869,34501,1215,27220,479,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009
