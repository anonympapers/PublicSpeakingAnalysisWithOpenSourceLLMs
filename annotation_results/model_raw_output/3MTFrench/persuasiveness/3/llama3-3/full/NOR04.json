{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-29T13:35:22.052164397Z","response":"Based on the provided transcript, I would evaluate the degree of persuasion as follows:\n\n* The speaker starts by emphasizing the importance of finding a solution to feed 10 billion people and highlights the challenges posed by the current food system.\n* They then introduce insects as a potential solution, highlighting their nutritional value and environmental benefits.\n* The speaker shares their experience conducting interviews with children aged 6-12 to understand their perceptions and motivations towards insect-based foods.\n* They emphasize the importance of addressing children's concerns and educating them about sustainable food practices.\n\nConsidering these points, I would rate the degree of persuasion as **4** out of 5 (very persuasive). The speaker presents a clear and compelling case for considering insects as a viable solution to address global food challenges. Their use of personal experience, data, and storytelling helps to build trust with the audience and makes their argument more convincing.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the speaker's tone might come across as slightly too optimistic or even alarmist in some parts, which could potentially detract from the persuasiveness of their message. However, overall, the speaker presents a well-reasoned and engaging case that is likely to resonate with many listeners.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,64105,64,11412,379,9189,4068,46798,38315,220,605,2606,81560,409,48577,14848,220,508,1135,949,2009,893,593,951,594,40751,11,19227,1744,326,93847,1880,3625,2092,82,17634,306,77411,3869,9517,2805,325,3869,20662,3488,13,423,49455,519,5636,1744,514,72601,38450,12267,1180,4088,25400,27584,3122,978,1765,6316,4186,8082,37295,409,27750,594,40751,39015,11,39043,11412,2098,969,25108,1414,27549,5019,3869,39587,5899,404,77558,514,10025,593,294,6,1354,978,2407,13109,38450,12267,7930,274,52152,1137,11,22011,49733,45889,35881,2734,552,71686,13,19421,4502,3625,27080,288,97958,1208,6425,949,2998,1218,20995,514,40970,27080,68,11,76076,15890,514,26483,123541,11,259,41901,1446,2852,3869,1208,1499,258,8082,951,31674,2852,11,8065,281,2428,324,409,342,38880,11,6033,35597,11,8065,35641,951,28658,91691,11,7930,28130,5899,1339,6730,857,321,11,389,1826,39892,57992,8047,294,6,39883,13,1708,1105,41091,11,42676,503,6,306,1438,3846,98020,11,4864,259,41901,9517,6229,3869,29449,18111,324,38450,367,13,19421,97507,11,9189,514,3665,89,25692,85815,6502,11,10071,3625,27080,288,15132,1370,8318,3625,4039,12249,3625,5636,33670,1773,812,11,1880,3625,5636,69714,22589,409,1208,3197,66522,13,81245,15132,27981,5512,3869,6800,1773,978,331,6853,1880,25692,85815,6316,34923,648,10778,38450,12267,27220,5019,514,1615,20372,11067,409,2486,467,13,5034,18528,951,27080,288,11,7010,514,1760,978,258,28170,1880,1332,76743,2249,11,28130,80779,6316,51304,5318,2265,290,64829,7930,8024,8065,2033,409,1208,51304,5318,2265,290,64829,951,453,318,2439,14464,65832,11,409,5636,11,46152,9395,109960,306,409,220,605,3869,220,1041,37291,40970,409,7591,331,1441,1880,409,56086,3869,67781,409,1446,265,1744,3625,3008,1553,267,32029,13,19421,28130,2267,1260,20545,665,30217,579,29557,409,3625,27389,444,12329,5019,951,38682,1769,6033,7515,3904,5019,951,38737,35030,3074,2249,13,1708,1105,665,6225,30711,519,951,14240,29246,46939,86595,5512,1765,6316,7187,294,6,329,360,466,99690,78125,354,1880,389,46939,6316,21063,79380,308,19395,1413,409,20662,95234,11,1880,514,7591,9866,513,42199,1082,1765,3625,60404,13,41621,12584,89,514,13510,87320,11,84568,3355,89810,16968,71357,11,66021,1744,3625,60404,11,409,1370,28130,7138,11,46152,43732,78,1188,409,514,38900,44178,1864,479,951,88025,13,4366,264,4618,1759,11,46152,15132,409,12108,294,953,5636,76145,294,6,6258,23723,8065,19910,3930,100016,13,41621,326,6,4202,74466,294,41901,13550,285,11,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,83067,1880,409,60946,265,1208,21063,951,60404,11,3869,326,6,19395,569,409,27750,55744,8467,11,54401,294,6,519,1056,13154,1880,294,6,582,5807,40538,43153,4046,12821,1157,15132,52962,3808,3869,27549,13,27058,3846,20028,11,4864,296,1441,326,6,98723,45973,514,18653,2171,3675,9952,951,60404,409,220,21,3869,220,17,8261,1880,42138,3625,39929,1380,38096,11,27750,1218,2171,80463,841,29557,376,546,1370,1208,16578,409,85877,440,261,13,11876,2144,38647,15132,20897,67,14014,11,8841,1640,8467,1880,7829,75,645,2761,65220,28130,1913,1880,28130,25835,13,1708,1105,4502,4864,66517,16968,39043,11,1880,1744,4864,3355,729,75804,88253,5019,9189,514,15473,444,466,11,272,17771,70374,5019,9189,13510,1744,5019,6316,3197,66522,1156,48099,1880,27220,11,4864,436,6321,514,38900,2109,10515,7404,3869,3846,42463,13,19421,4502,20662,2217,9189,1370,23577,75804,88253,33288,11,294,953,27750,45889,65838,11,27549,9189,281,1138,4558,51137,16968,3869,20272,4725,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,3984,36815,11,358,1053,15806,279,8547,315,98224,439,11263,1473,9,578,19114,8638,555,82003,279,12939,315,9455,264,6425,311,5510,220,605,7239,1274,323,22020,279,11774,37260,555,279,1510,3691,1887,13,198,9,2435,1243,19678,41911,439,264,4754,6425,11,39686,872,43226,907,323,12434,7720,13,198,9,578,19114,13551,872,3217,31474,19905,449,2911,20330,220,21,12,717,311,3619,872,51866,323,65931,7119,27080,6108,15657,13,198,9,2435,47032,279,12939,315,28118,2911,596,10742,323,67805,1124,922,22556,3691,12659,627,198,83896,1521,3585,11,358,1053,4478,279,8547,315,98224,439,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,320,1225,66343,570,578,19114,18911,264,2867,323,29722,1162,369,13126,41911
