{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-29T13:26:18.884553932Z","response":"**TRANSCRIPTION**\n\nThe speaker is discussing a war in the sea, where there are good and bad guys. They're talking about their own perspective, saying that at home, the bad guys are predators and the good ones are prey. They mention that in the sea, there's no beach or sand dunes, but instead, there are rocks, shells, and sediment, which can be used for camouflage. The speaker then compares this to a \"cold war\" where spies don't want to reveal themselves because they might get eaten.\n\nThe speaker introduces their thesis topic, which is about the effects of certain entities (presumably referring to molecules or chemicals) on the behavior of crabs. They explain that these entities can affect the concentration of serotonin in humans, which is linked to happiness and depression. The speaker then wonders if these entities can also affect the camouflage abilities of crabs.\n\nThe speaker shares their daily routine, where they collect crab shells and contaminated entities, and then conduct tests to see how well the crabs do in different conditions (e.g., with or without stress). They conclude that crabs that bathed in contaminated water had better camouflage than those that didn't. However, these crabs also stopped eating normally.\n\n**ÉCHELLE**\n\n[Échelle de 1=pas du tout persuasif à 5=très persuasif.]\n\n**DIMENSION**\n\nWhat is the degree of persuasion of this discourse? Is the speaker's reasoning rigorous?\n\n**TÂCHE**\n\n[Evaluate the transcription of the public performance given in the section TRANSCRIPTION. Use the description of the dimension described in the section DIMENSION to understand how to evaluate it. Give ONLY a single number as an answer - this number is a score and should be attributed according to the scale described in the section ÉCHELLE.]\n\nI would rate the persuasion level of this discourse as **3** out of 5, for the following reasons:\n\n1. The speaker's reasoning seems to be mostly logical and coherent.\n2. They provide some concrete examples and data (although not necessarily rigorous or scientific) to support their claims.\n3. However, the language used is often unclear and lacks precision, making it difficult to fully understand the speaker's points.\n\nOverall, while the speaker makes a few compelling arguments, their delivery and reasoning could be improved for greater persuasion and clarity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,63762,6502,4502,9189,62299,8065,2126,519,10071,7010,1208,4809,11,272,17771,1208,1709,67100,13,1708,1105,22299,7010,40744,3625,1709,261,417,11,3900,379,264,951,16265,8839,1880,951,32118,99906,13,2998,5589,39043,7591,3825,409,1647,513,2035,13,34447,46206,41091,3625,32118,99906,513,15132,951,27389,1045,1759,1880,3625,16265,8839,1880,3625,463,343,2641,13,19421,7010,1208,4809,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,409,24614,1557,10253,294,8699,1824,52822,1759,13,7695,379,264,96308,951,264,645,11,951,938,331,1441,1880,3930,2092,13,2895,66096,10253,447,2053,389,25692,513,6730,62840,261,13,19421,294,6,52009,1759,7010,1208,4809,11,272,17771,3846,1744,96308,1208,1709,67100,13091,579,13,62293,951,52314,294,6,25632,919,7930,841,348,3023,969,1188,6502,513,20028,951,9427,16339,1370,1069,324,409,513,46131,296,4091,13,6178,72,503,34155,9964,22011,26633,296,75104,3930,934,17771,1647,1344,425,13,5034,19266,1557,1826,514,1589,8393,324,13,5034,19266,1557,5019,9189,2503,8977,11,272,17771,6316,27812,483,409,1208,281,1557,324,1880,3930,1652,1764,13,46408,25692,523,283,1565,7010,326,6,25632,4558,346,409,326,6,13559,479,13,29749,1446,300,653,28800,514,43453,409,7957,24537,13,2009,1589,8393,324,25400,11,3900,523,283,1565,11,10071,1744,42676,3900,1826,36963,11,44829,272,17771,6502,86966,11,96308,7010,326,6,25632,4558,346,409,326,6,52822,61480,13,24703,35737,653,28800,514,43453,514,35462,2709,751,220,1114,13,62463,17899,288,16948,4558,1634,14848,326,6,1334,71451,1765,12155,14236,294,22827,11837,306,10484,2053,15132,60120,13,19421,42676,84568,15132,60120,84568,15132,54008,67882,11981,77,14081,4893,8065,27389,1045,324,13,356,17771,5019,39043,934,35329,47090,934,80720,513,6636,11,4864,757,36731,934,80720,25692,13,14465,9189,44314,2852,409,1208,1709,67100,13091,579,13,19421,27549,308,17771,6502,934,35329,379,50590,16968,955,409,4020,1725,2922,6496,13,1219,2727,951,4020,1725,409,24817,78,10145,28463,11,1765,1208,21948,409,1208,19266,23985,4160,556,27584,951,1651,64,14295,523,1572,13,1219,2727,3625,33651,4881,14848,21109,1133,13,19421,3399,11,665,1208,4809,11,272,17771,24068,321,13,89578,1744,3625,1651,64,14295,523,1572,11,84568,3355,89810,409,17317,13,3341,97507,11,11083,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,3869,46777,37291,1744,9189,47592,48908,653,35030,292,2908,11,66090,63484,42138,653,293,1116,21765,7010,15265,34922,11412,513,38831,15170,7010,15265,361,10010,11,12155,436,33920,31539,11,12155,13259,1759,5019,1913,404,3388,7010,514,296,99746,13,19421,4502,272,17771,934,35329,44142,14707,11,653,28800,22299,11083,67,986,665,4156,20712,13,4366,346,934,54386,513,62163,14707,11,3846,1744,40744,27750,1651,64,14295,38094,8467,56311,14707,20028,1765,12155,22673,11,272,17771,514,60512,13,12623,51625,285,42625,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,10253,1218,35933,1685,325,1759,13,1708,1105,87320,3625,1218,35933,1685,325,1759,11,66021,1744,272,17771,35030,292,2908,46206,326,93825,2854,467,11,29557,73468,294,6,19729,479,261,3625,32466,294,31109,22337,978,3395,375,11,1208,19266,299,783,483,13,19421,272,17771,20662,27584,19266,299,783,483,7930,11412,23761,77932,409,29449,7970,383,324,42676,389,665,264,48488,6033,29449,14240,266,951,3577,22589,42676,389,665,264,21965,28800,13,356,17771,1208,19266,331,6853,60512,6502,3488,409,7591,4099,13,34447,409,88068,11,44829,593,1208,19266,299,783,483,11,20662,37291,63484,11,11412,23761,11866,5118,8047,7010,3625,523,24483,7010,3625,2609,3808,409,76651,13,1708,1105,4864,757,36731,1153,978,3869,1208,3488,11,1826,54312,1744,3625,1218,35933,1685,325,1759,56311,39929,653,67781,1765,514,88068,409,1208,19266,331,6853,60512,949,1708,1105,8065,99568,3675,11,503,34155,326,26248,333,951,98676,1441,951,46141,14295,7010,514,35522,978,10253,1218,35933,1685,325,1759,11,44829,4864,91507,20028,45347,16968,3197,409,1296,5019,46131,4502,1120,1133,514,3567,26584,409,82134,16948,919,13,14465,326,6,22231,818,951,25664,11,4864,326,34155,9395,978,7010,951,2606,4918,85114,11,44829,4864,1239,42441,1120,1133,4502,3846,6730,283,69,273,28463,14707,13,2998,1370,543,51453,11,4864,326,6,22231,818,43905,3197,409,1296,13,1708,1105,39043,11412,46131,4502,46152,15132,8631,5512,6033,2536,11,4502,3900,66167,77441,3972,11,4502,3900,513,1376,277,447,1339,11,4502,514,60534,14707,11,272,17771,514,523,4558,593,5352,3543,13,19421,55398,6,3457,11,503,34155,59148,1653,1744,11083,274,1154,4864,296,6,20243,4714,288,7930,513,293,4201,64,1188,7010,6316,8065,35522,978,10253,1218,35933,1685,325,1759,84764,1188,653,49348,88068,1744,28130,390,1658,12339,3869,28130,21497,11,7930,513,293,4201,1339,7010,6316,1200,554,13,19421,11,389,264,33537,978,11,45575,97507,11,389,44521,1339,326,98279,4099,1744,3900,3567,26584,409,31326,1439,16948,919,13,34447,503,34155,59148,1653,934,35329,308,26248,436,5615,52274,5636,60019,3869,274,83508,318,1992,13,1219,2727,75249,11,23761,653,7970,16948,290,11,653,38847,1765,4538,38450,367,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,4
