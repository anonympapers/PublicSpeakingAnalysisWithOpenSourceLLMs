They present two examples: first, a woman accused of adultery or fornication, whose body becomes the object of a crime; second, a case from 1794 involving a married woman who had multiple servants and was subjected to insults and a song written about her. The speaker argues that the female body is often at the center of crimes and that women's identities are shaped by those around them.\n\n**ÉCHELLE**\n\nThe Échelle de persuasion est une échelle qui va de 1 (pas du tout persuasif) à 5 (très persuasif).\n\n**DIMENSION**\n\nLa dimension de la persuasion est l'efficacité avec laquelle le discours convainc et persuade son public. Le raisonnement est-il rigoureux ?\n\n**TÂCHE**\n\nÉvaluez la transcription de la performance publique donnée dans la section TRANSCRIPTION.\n\nMa réponse : **3**\n\nJe donne un score de 3 car, bien que le discours soit passionné et bien structuré, il y a des éléments qui manquent pour convaincre complètement. Le raisonnement est partiellement rigoureux, mais il faudrait plus de preuves et d'arguments solides pour persuader vraiment.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1370,3846,51655,409,3930,68226,32592,3625,20043,2249,951,56127,13,41621,326,6,582,5259,15760,89,20662,6140,389,264,326,52152,708,11943,30,1708,2727,324,76190,1001,70927,288,13,46706,20662,6140,11,326,6,26380,13109,16968,1218,20712,87264,264,392,5741,1370,3846,7930,513,39904,32592,3625,503,32932,951,56127,13,19421,45602,77635,3625,123299,9004,3869,951,2389,552,13,19421,14707,4237,8977,1339,9189,934,35329,379,264,50026,220,5067,8261,7010,514,11284,64,3972,409,9822,11,3846,7930,513,39904,32592,3625,503,32932,951,56127,11,490,78283,11,951,503,6,300,28463,48488,13,2998,59157,13109,11,503,34155,42587,978,3625,7477,3476,9465,514,34922,58482,1083,258,1880,514,9977,3869,1208,1913,3930,77638,268,46433,713,13,19421,4864,91507,9189,1647,95920,934,6,37907,15132,27750,7477,3476,13,12029,20712,51173,11,514,4865,3930,34922,58482,1083,258,11,70927,3930,9977,13,4366,51173,11,1208,18694,6822,12339,6033,57109,5118,68636,7930,92215,2995,408,38149,951,60404,1880,3625,503,1468,1769,11,46131,5636,4502,3869,1913,13109,13,1611,2249,90272,51173,11,653,28800,5636,6485,68,13,48109,4160,3457,653,6900,9465,665,220,972,6281,13,356,8458,264,1744,17536,9115,14081,4558,2392,6316,18694,12985,8047,7930,991,5481,648,51854,4958,635,1759,13,2582,11,665,9880,11,326,6,408,361,272,17771,4958,84048,11,8065,513,20028,6316,523,37645,1099,978,3415,1082,3869,4538,70927,13,2009,34922,409,9115,14081,4558,2392,1826,3869,1208,37291,326,6,67816,294,22827,21134,9977,11,326,6,67816,409,1208,523,37645,1099,978,3415,1082,11,409,326,6,1354,495,68,13,34447,514,34922,409,9115,14081,4558,2392,1826,28463,514,6505,294,22827,2132,9977,13,34447,259,19010,15433,2439,1744,3846,2132,9977,1826,14707,4538,52827,11,5636,13080,40970,1744,326,54386,49733,3930,11412,1169,13,29749,1560,1370,9115,14081,4558,2392,11,27549,98375,11,1880,1370,4538,12985,13,41621,23933,10333,11,4864,63762,409,60946,265,4068,26725,27750,17073,29059,3695,90053,3930,34922,58482,1083,258,13,19421,272,3433,10333,1474,6870,11,3900,379,665,264,653,7251,24181,13,27058,3846,20028,11,4864,36731,682,978,10253,39104,7140,3916,13,622,34155,2267,1088,8065,4876,1291,951,2960,33903,294,82405,17724,5860,24985,3946,13,14465,3625,16796,1380,38096,13,14465,3625,16796,665,49564,978,7010,7643,2385,409,46681,13,7695,296,26248,4498,84,665,20272,20028,951,5935,82,951,20719,8467,13,507,2005,11,66021,934,41901,87810,11,389,20272,28463,951,71808,13,19421,8065,1620,11,4864,738,349,1744,326,6,1748,13109,951,31656,7591,3825,71151,409,66056,7930,513,1522,306,32592,326,6,5673,648,375,13,27058,20028,4382,11,294,22827,81337,11,17317,57038,3625,31656,14707,665,85182,818,324,409,43153,34922,13,19421,409,326,49455,265,11,17317,57038,3625,31656,8811,85182,818,324,409,43153,34922,13,11876,31656,1081,8699,11,19637,645,7930,15132,15765,484,5512,11,81186,1370,3625,53542,13,1708,1105,11,6666,11,26725,308,17771,6502,513,490,3581,5512,11,8348,13532,25253,4046,4253,978,38639,1821,13,62408,37291,63484,11,17317,74533,3869,7364,665,220,1114,4767,13,356,17771,326,6,75876,409,1208,386,24201,11,1880,272,17771,7010,326,31769,6200,1082,1744,19205,554,635,653,32592,49893,73,2194,409,2231,467,84364,409,220,1032,13,1183,12416,25945,11,8065,10398,12416,11837,275,11,3900,379,264,1208,7015,1082,409,272,24889,9952,514,550,38816,13,4418,66,11,9189,23933,10333,11,2536,71686,3625,53542,1765,6723,1188,3625,31656,11,10071,3625,31656,28463,1765,6723,1188,9465,84568,11,1880,513,17634,306,1370,86633,25945,8811,1037,13,24703,934,35329,47090,64290,404,11,272,17771,1744,514,34922,11,4864,9189,665,436,57332,3062,7010,1208,47371,4144,409,326,6,1748,13109,951,35030,3557,11,1880,81186,951,31656,35030,3557,13,7695,274,6,74972,2536,6502,409,5945,72905,3625,10479,2396,47371,285,11,10071,96308,409,5945,72905,1208,3488,409,1208,43656,3930,34922,11,409,4538,39474,503,6,4202,2192,11,1880,409,4538,51913,3294,6033,6502,7010,514,27138,13,622,34155,48488,294,58591,285,7930,757,834,306,11,10071,23008,326,49455,265,11,389,924,713,1339,1296,42676,27584,514,4647,625,425,934,35329,41518,379,264,13,11842,11,10071,9189,4635,2852,53070,16968,11,4502,514,55392,1604,264,19443,84,4864,259,41901,16796,11,3900,757,9839,1149,306,8941,961,11,3900,757,15119,375,13,64105,64,9189,61158,6853,6502,11,924,713,1339,1296,13,435,2259,1001,11,9189,274,34886,294,69537,541,9952,41091,11,16968,3846,7930,4647,625,425,11,308,17771,6502,83187,479,4046,68155,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,
