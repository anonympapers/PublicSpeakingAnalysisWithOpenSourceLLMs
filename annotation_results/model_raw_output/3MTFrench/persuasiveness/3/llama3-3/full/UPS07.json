{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-29T10:38:28.241341846Z","response":"Based on the transcription, I would evaluate the persuasion level as follows:\n\nTRANSCRIPT: The speaker starts by highlighting the massive production of Simon and its impact on the environment. They then pose a question about how this industry can continue to produce such large amounts without collapsing. The speaker shares their own research experience and findings, which they claim will lead to the development of a new, more eco-friendly Simon. Finally, they present an impossible love story between two identical particles of negative charge in a concrete mixer.\n\nÉCHELLE = [1=pas du tout persuasif à 5=très persuasif.]\n\nDIMENSION = [À votre avis, quel est le degré de persuasion du discours dans cette transcription, c'est-à-dire que la personne rédige efficacement un message convaincant ? Son raisonnement est-il rigoureux ?]\n\nTÂCHE = [Évaluer la transcription de la performance publique donnée dans la section TRANSCRIPTION. Pour comprendre comment l'évaluer, utilisez la description de la dimension décrite dans la section DIMENSION. Donnez UNIQUEMENT un chiffre comme réponse - ce chiffre est un score et il doit être attribué en fonction de l'échelle décrite dans la section ÉCHELLE.]\n\nScore: 3\n\nRationale:\n\nThe speaker's argumentation is somewhat convincing, as they provide some facts about the environmental impact of Simon production and express a desire to find a solution. However, their presentation lacks concrete evidence or scientific rigor to support their claims. The inclusion of an impossible love story between two particles in a concrete mixer seems out of place and may actually detract from the overall persuasiveness of the discourse. Overall, while the speaker's enthusiasm is palpable, their argumentation could be improved by providing more credible supporting evidence.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,653,649,290,7930,46777,76132,86100,409,7591,20672,77558,15265,60172,6316,93128,75735,818,409,11347,409,22021,13,356,17771,14707,39043,11,220,2636,15395,437,1208,10484,13109,409,22021,2558,635,46777,76132,5019,46777,76132,13,62293,39043,389,19477,3159,7010,11083,389,11,12155,26886,645,11,12155,76680,9011,10367,13,38891,89,45575,326,6,58400,409,20662,5788,11191,1765,326,41901,2842,40280,13,445,6,485,592,7379,3930,22021,1826,77932,5019,220,605,4,951,4046,2400,82,409,7432,17,7010,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,220,605,4,29121,1133,5019,514,22021,13,1952,1826,665,5542,409,89504,11083,85321,1880,9622,46138,409,326,55624,14081,49530,8065,31307,2320,84,54206,1370,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,41199,951,97739,19153,13,19421,5019,61512,54613,841,829,275,9517,301,1001,4068,3900,34501,818,13,27058,62998,3846,76680,9011,10367,841,274,6,6581,2159,265,6502,949,3206,45715,272,17771,294,6,1138,1553,1880,59394,3869,20662,3488,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,503,34155,63669,294,6,14283,5363,261,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,12155,22021,3869,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,13,2998,5589,1239,42441,89,11,4864,296,49963,1082,3738,1133,6502,3869,653,73757,13,1952,20605,68,76680,269,3457,729,11,503,34155,34280,978,1647,46110,24671,17274,409,90551,783,3869,326,6,8904,324,1744,4864,39904,951,76145,1880,951,76145,3869,8678,805,9880,3869,85434,13,435,2259,1001,4864,4790,9425,1744,503,53149,79717,665,4046,1030,367,1744,294,81979,7330,333,8467,5019,665,75144,9952,326,77025,5481,404,409,43998,10515,12329,653,43453,22021,10748,31807,11451,1880,5636,91329,1640,2428,13,14465,9189,3327,2428,3846,1744,503,34155,100162,47053,2957,4046,1030,367,11,4864,2773,1441,13,27058,20028,39043,11,503,34155,63669,294,49152,13603,653,32150,556,6316,87810,294,58591,414,13,39783,4809,588,4618,817,87810,294,58591,414,7930,513,39904,7010,6316,90551,783,20712,13,356,17771,326,6,90446,12266,409,26633,54008,417,409,22021,3608,8467,409,6900,308,19395,1413,49733,665,12704,84,13,1952,348,11206,1339,274,6,31748,7010,1208,7138,409,1167,67816,308,19395,1413,513,2109,974,13,2582,11,3846,12095,308,6,1138,535,6502,7010,514,22021,13,51097,26633,54008,417,308,19395,5983,15132,20272,288,908,5512,77433,3869,326,91655,951,86696,220,11685,20940,22589,7930,513,9839,329,306,28463,7010,29449,90551,783,20712,13,62463,220,11685,20940,22589,513,281,448,306,9465,12155,26633,54008,417,409,22021,1880,3900,47090,14707,514,13510,4502,11540,306,3846,5743,13,2998,25500,11,46152,264,79738,22299,6316,14480,22299,409,82134,87892,22299,653,9465,12985,1880,18694,11,6033,5019,22641,261,1880,14707,1765,88026,42676,27584,550,5615,2641,4998,95923,5512,11,12776,1154,409,5019,220,966,8261,13,1252,834,2092,392,645,13,19421,28463,653,834,2092,392,645,3567,1188,514,55520,9465,12155,26633,54008,417,409,22021,13,39783,1826,3869,56316,1370,6316,5457,5066,541,68976,13,356,17771,77433,3869,20662,5457,1744,514,22021,1826,1208,14480,3869,5636,31807,11451,409,390,846,8699,325,11,1744,3846,76680,9011,10367,7930,264,35597,409,25646,41199,1744,503,34155,59062,978,3869,89504,13,14465,36731,97717,934,22827,9880,11,389,2961,1553,64,3869,52895,716,6316,48659,20278,7930,15572,68,409,1208,27584,76407,1744,514,22021,14135,8301,11,10071,48488,40970,1499,72,5048,3869,2558,556,13,1952,40142,45575,653,22021,91329,1640,2428,1880,272,17771,9952,3846,22021,1744,17317,19477,52750,2439,7010,11083,8261,11,12155,26886,645,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,46940,11,358,1053,15806,279,98224,2237,439,11263,512,198,49873,25823,25,578,19114,8638,555,39686,279,11191,5788,315,22021,323,1202,5536,389,279,4676,13,2435,1243,17477,264,3488,922,1268,420,5064,649,3136,311,8356,1778,3544,15055,2085,72618,13,578,19114,13551,872,1866,3495,3217,323,14955,11,902,814,3802,690,3063,311,279,4500,315,264,502,11,810,42688,22658,22021,13,17830,11,814,3118,459,12266,3021,3446,1990,1403,20086,19252,315,8389,6900,304,264,14509,38878,627,198,27887,44893,43,877,284,510,16,28,42201,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,198,198,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,
