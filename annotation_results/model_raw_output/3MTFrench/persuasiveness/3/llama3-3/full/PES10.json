They explain that the image is made up of three points and that if they do well, the audience should understand why this is not a plan for Paris. The first point is the object of study, which is the public lighting network in Paris. This network is a system of points and connections between these points, including lamps and electrical cables. The speaker notes that something more is needed to make it an interesting and useful concept, such as a holistic approach.\n\nThe second point is the framework, which is the urban mutations in Paris. The speaker explains that this refers to how the city has changed over time, from a small village to the modern city we know today. They suggest that this change may have parallels with the evolution of the public lighting network.\n\nThe third and final point is the problem, which is often described as \"smart\" or \"intelligent.\" The speaker notes that this term is often used to describe new urban ideals, and that it is connected to the concept of public lighting. They suggest that the public lighting network may be seen as a key element in building an intelligent city.\n\nThe speaker concludes by saying that they have explained why this is not a plan for Paris, but rather an image or representation of the city's evolution.\n\nÉCHELLE:\n\nDimension:\n\nI would rate the degree of persuasion of the discourse in this transcription as 4 out of 5. The speaker presents their ideas clearly and logically, using metaphors and anecdotes to illustrate their points. They also provide a clear framework for understanding their argument. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a perfect score is that some of the connections between the different ideas may be a bit tenuous.\n\nTÂCHE:\n\n4","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,41901,16796,9395,978,39929,6316,36252,26626,74260,285,68636,6033,38920,50750,1295,1732,64829,6033,30179,6960,89,87810,13,423,59858,18757,4365,1647,10045,10071,16968,3846,1744,503,6,434,61055,20662,2217,13,19421,4864,36731,9038,2428,1744,514,2835,2447,12844,34501,818,4495,1133,66021,1744,43905,326,6,391,652,978,71,2711,2109,974,21273,355,13,4418,66,20662,2217,11,4864,91507,9189,3625,3327,72684,665,56321,3585,13,19421,4502,4864,757,7591,65,583,4618,14707,11,1208,1913,9189,60946,3625,87320,3846,71139,6502,653,3197,409,12366,13,3206,21134,1486,272,17771,1647,31260,13,24971,653,31260,8065,6225,64441,11,66090,25500,11,272,17771,409,3846,1765,13,1252,31260,8065,6225,31260,294,57286,29246,13,3206,31260,272,17771,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,13,2009,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,272,17771,653,98947,13,356,17771,653,40126,409,3585,1880,409,83199,9465,27750,3585,11,951,326,6,3342,329,17724,1880,951,48924,39863,98151,462,14295,13,80905,71357,13,19421,79071,14896,409,5636,11,79071,14896,7930,665,20272,653,31260,92759,519,1826,8791,458,5019,56321,8261,1370,46415,1370,51173,13,24703,934,54386,917,6853,653,7434,24429,97496,665,3703,266,1354,16036,380,8467,4502,9189,55162,41881,653,28800,1437,404,978,665,77824,13,13789,11,503,34155,653,31260,294,57286,29246,13,43987,26178,11,3900,757,47090,653,60697,13,24703,60697,513,15132,3625,34684,16036,288,41958,3675,13,1708,1105,934,17771,54312,1744,272,17771,653,7434,39723,9189,45366,3057,9211,25945,51794,479,13,423,6,52009,1759,1744,9189,47592,26725,665,83067,1744,3930,46110,14458,7930,43989,326,6,332,12416,55398,6,2933,6800,12366,17855,11,12366,308,17771,6502,44093,24560,1208,27584,1880,1208,57128,294,31109,39973,2349,13,12623,83457,1744,514,1080,12844,951,53542,834,1339,15265,326,12339,13,19421,4864,757,326,34155,14175,285,294,6,1662,2743,25692,85815,28463,83457,1744,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,13,3341,1765,3625,46106,1206,1154,78511,14295,41958,3675,11,3900,264,6316,87810,81621,11,6316,59471,30179,6960,1880,25692,85815,6316,52087,8047,3938,13,24703,1744,503,6,2706,81356,11,272,17771,514,51136,261,3869,1208,85722,9952,1208,88265,1208,57128,409,1208,39973,2349,25692,85815,25400,71751,6316,38920,2035,7010,3625,14240,29246,78810,33903,8065,81337,409,98947,409,7710,1370,51173,11,6033,409,1208,48364,42914,13,16770,7970,11,503,34155,653,31260,13,622,34155,653,60697,11,74699,3900,47090,653,80259,13,2998,69,1607,306,11,272,17771,6316,51651,14896,11,272,17771,2307,13,356,17771,6316,52088,978,8637,2428,7330,52760,13,14465,36731,1685,593,1765,665,39929,13,7695,1826,31605,978,409,26633,78199,81186,13,7695,17317,3288,11,71151,42587,8047,11,8811,13550,285,11,39973,1880,60538,6960,13,1708,1105,87320,1208,17536,60538,6960,43989,12,6853,71151,51744,447,8047,9952,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,30,4366,346,1744,272,17771,653,7434,409,1206,978,11866,2428,11,653,35462,887,63497,78810,467,13,4418,66,11,3900,379,264,653,348,3023,14687,1744,9189,12584,89,12602,1765,46777,3190,24812,324,13,41621,934,54386,264,653,98947,57485,7010,43905,1208,39973,13,15663,1771,348,3023,969,1188,14240,408,265,3738,288,9875,409,1208,39973,5019,4046,49272,261,5636,60538,336,479,13,356,17771,83195,1744,9964,439,4647,635,60946,265,39043,13,12535,1826,54312,1744,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,1826,908,978,10253,34684,1370,13532,15564,30,19421,4068,1826,54312,934,35329,25692,19477,52750,6316,39973,60538,6960,4502,653,19227,7434,29253,30,13789,11,3900,757,66167,653,28800,409,27138,13,64105,64,264,653,28800,409,9189,3327,76366,87320,3846,1879,295,6502,653,3197,409,41958,13,3341,22299,7010,514,84850,4558,21152,57234,11,272,17771,6316,91678,367,3930,3197,409,41958,13,2100,333,7930,274,59858,11,514,1069,396,265,11,3846,308,17771,6502,653,23496,84,13,2009,1069,396,265,49733,11,272,17771,1647,46110,523,283,11,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,13,42215,264,31632,409,1208,10512,648,3869,21273,10670,514,3197,409,41958,1370,39587,13,19421,3930,16081,25400,264,33537,978,829,57128,13,19421,272,17771,653,1879,68,11,503,6,2706,81356,1744,9189,5945,1055,10333,3930,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,13,9605,14896,1744,1826,6316,52087,8047,1370,682,4558,3869,1208,57128,409,1208,39973,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3
