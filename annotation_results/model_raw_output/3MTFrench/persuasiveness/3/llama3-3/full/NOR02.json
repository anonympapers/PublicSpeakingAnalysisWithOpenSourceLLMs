It starts with a personal anecdote and then delves into the methodology of the research. The language is clear, but the tone is quite academic and formal.\n\n**EVALUATION**: I will evaluate the transcription based on the persuasion dimension (ÉCHELLE).\n\nThe speech aims to persuade the audience that the author's thesis has value and is worth investigating further. To achieve this, the author presents a logical argument, uses personal anecdotes, and provides some background information on their research.\n\n**RAISONNING**: The reasoning is mostly logical and coherent. The author provides some evidence-based points (e.g., farmers being generally healthier than others) to support their thesis. However, there are moments where the language becomes overly formal or academic, which might make it harder for non-experts to follow.\n\n**PERSUASION**: I would rate the persuasion level as 4 out of 5. The author presents a clear and logical argument, but some sections might feel too technical or dry for a broader audience.\n\n**TÂCHE (SCORE)**: Based on the ÉCHELLE dimension, I assign a score of **4** to this transcription.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1744,9189,55162,41881,9189,20028,5636,62197,11,6316,3488,36897,5019,37622,934,54386,61464,11,1744,326,54386,264,16968,274,6,306,408,84,8065,40970,6316,37291,5019,294,22827,520,7430,978,13,445,1105,593,503,31769,2629,285,5636,36963,11,5019,296,26248,1814,3869,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,11,389,31025,4618,71151,409,90194,653,36252,1291,1744,503,41901,81,5615,645,11,1744,45602,390,4120,1339,7643,77323,13,12095,4864,308,34155,6502,21965,665,84871,409,26317,7591,971,552,85505,645,1744,503,34155,18757,20028,55398,81991,57485,11,3900,97487,9517,403,519,1744,3846,31025,321,308,6,22290,1188,6502,3869,16968,665,95917,359,13,19421,1744,326,58591,414,409,4538,36252,1291,841,1760,1435,1339,6502,665,43905,76076,27138,829,77323,13,12029,20712,51173,11,514,46838,69405,20243,495,12844,71151,11939,52235,1370,43153,1218,299,1220,11,46152,15132,13509,54960,665,49348,77323,1744,1208,9517,1575,3869,7187,13,81245,282,3972,40970,11,46152,30870,16149,5636,13,27058,61512,11,46152,80664,306,9517,978,43310,934,85217,779,1188,5636,2961,5014,1744,294,49152,13603,3738,288,1853,9268,13,445,6,306,969,3904,11,3625,326,41901,69,9769,9004,308,6,546,409,3846,934,35329,379,264,13,3959,51423,1645,76743,3946,7930,259,35657,85114,2849,2482,409,29449,29340,52087,5512,3869,17317,47371,408,265,45973,3625,17188,11,3625,294,533,978,4108,13,1708,1105,11,4068,58673,15610,11,25692,57375,665,27256,20099,28130,77323,30,19421,14707,11,272,17771,16968,326,6,67816,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,60946,265,934,6,37907,15132,3625,33013,98942,11,37329,21041,294,52152,27256,20099,1208,12366,3675,6033,409,19637,645,665,282,3972,46206,3625,17744,38647,13,14465,66517,346,1744,1647,76190,409,326,31769,10629,17060,648,38469,13,921,20234,5634,258,11,4864,757,3625,665,75,79351,1208,281,1295,11843,12339,53926,2427,986,13,1708,1105,11,1208,55133,14240,2070,42182,2800,261,1208,34024,409,15562,13,63120,11,4502,16948,48099,9189,308,26248,554,89,6502,5019,3154,519,13510,1744,281,481,11,259,41901,6225,3869,1208,30179,2711,294,6,3394,24918,13,356,8458,326,6,40031,2987,409,550,5615,2641,6033,294,6,15336,29557,2221,409,7591,5589,404,6033,2536,11,326,6,582,455,359,87782,294,6,1354,355,1002,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,4502,1647,23423,306,11,1208,34024,274,6,329,569,265,514,38900,1317,361,13,33150,45369,409,28130,17536,4913,64829,11,3625,17744,38647,3381,96642,4595,294,6,37907,1481,9011,8696,409,7829,11,71151,3625,26633,665,27584,27138,13,19421,11,47090,44767,16968,653,40126,409,259,9011,8696,21797,288,4046,959,5741,288,13,4158,337,2392,15132,951,4039,12249,11,8522,409,61257,11,1370,1647,708,25105,951,61257,13,7695,29253,951,39999,76195,11,951,27080,76195,11,951,21901,82,409,18639,11,5636,409,296,4618,22337,20243,2482,96642,13,622,34155,39587,63669,409,74282,66014,326,6,49575,409,1208,17536,4913,64829,951,17744,38647,5019,60946,265,8065,64972,5019,1826,3212,1880,4046,838,8977,8065,64972,3625,2267,1220,409,95917,2957,409,27750,506,28536,1765,1208,7550,10610,2428,19637,645,6179,68,13,8560,75876,43765,11,6502,409,5780,5811,978,514,27138,13,1708,1105,11,4068,47929,7930,1826,6033,264,24560,46956,978,3869,75249,30,622,34155,326,6,12828,4769,409,9511,3869,7643,46096,11,1208,32118,97495,409,220,5245,220,931,23496,355,13,4072,645,58673,484,306,409,84364,6033,409,78060,7010,514,38900,3869,13842,56745,13,4656,13559,12,52822,61480,1880,10253,42587,811,20719,8467,11,4864,91507,259,1992,409,60946,265,934,2053,15132,3625,4398,3073,1821,9465,506,28536,1880,917,5169,16935,409,1208,8811,329,648,13,5034,523,992,13109,409,7643,270,4558,325,757,62163,409,9517,123541,13,1357,651,268,404,33670,1744,514,9977,841,45441,1081,285,13,69327,96308,33670,1744,1208,8811,329,648,308,26248,6502,2800,13,2331,220,29124,44893,43,877,284,510,27887,331,6853,409,220,16,17841,300,3930,16968,24613,300,333,3869,220,20,28,376,12416,24613,300,333,25750,76219,24557,284,510,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,60,51,33895,44893,284,510,27887,838,8977,1208,46940,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,33537,8047,7010,1208,3857,41447,24300,13,27058,60946,265,4068,326,31769,838,8977,11,69152,89,1208,4096,409,1208,13167,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,51959,24557,13,4418,55506,73450,5441,653,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,653,5573,1880,3900,42182,23761,17780,96559,665,34501,409,326,31769,331,6853,35881,1269,7010,1208,3857,29124,44893,43,877,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,8815,4999,198,6153,15884,5403,279,46940,11,358,690,15806,279,5178,323,3493,264,5573,382,9,9,49873,24300,96618,578,1495,374,264,8982,477,15864,922,279,3229,596,17850,389,279,5133,1990,29149,990,323,2890,13,1102,8638,449,264,4443,50750,1295,323,1243,1624,2396,1139,279,38152,315,279,3495,13,578,4221,374,2867,11,719,279,16630,374,5115,14584,323,16287,382,9,9,36
