{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:29:11.0995373Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using storytelling techniques, humor, and rhetorical questions. They establish a connection with the audience by sharing personal observations and experiences. The speaker's tone is engaging, and they use examples to illustrate their points, making the message more relatable and accessible.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's use of phrases such as \"l'objectif de ma thèse\" and \"mon laboratoire à moi, c'est vous\" creates a sense of intimacy and inclusivity, which helps to build trust with the audience. The speaker's passion for their research is also evident, which adds to the persuasiveness of their message.\n\nHowever, I would deduct one point because some parts of the speech may be perceived as self-indulgent or overly dramatic (e.g., \"vous m'avez appris charcita d'un plusieurs choses...\"). While these elements can add flavor and creativity to the speech, they might not resonate with every audience member.\n\nOverall, I believe that the speaker presents a compelling message, but it could be further refined for maximum impact.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,4635,2852,53070,1765,1543,1370,379,86451,13,41621,379,62299,25692,85815,46939,682,978,6033,3930,40970,9189,312,5259,2852,53070,514,82660,3527,13,27058,66056,7930,841,74282,79738,6502,11,272,17771,4382,13,1952,1826,4685,306,3930,15528,11,87885,7828,343,11,951,1380,988,11,665,7245,483,39973,1880,7598,11,16968,514,38900,513,7591,89,370,648,5019,20028,1437,28143,23761,22299,3869,1208,86451,13,19421,14707,1647,70927,409,350,26577,6178,1354,11,47090,653,16968,3930,656,18400,3869,1343,98078,48099,35597,5636,1765,79,1466,519,7930,35456,2035,7010,12155,26886,645,13,46706,76076,16948,2492,586,82,71151,8065,39002,409,326,93847,11,3625,6681,329,1354,14848,8541,685,3869,513,52962,261,22299,3869,1208,86451,11,45575,1744,514,39381,308,17771,3869,4972,72,6502,3869,3026,1435,5019,13,24703,15132,27750,16948,2492,2922,6496,1744,17317,57038,76190,978,3625,628,1154,78810,33903,37391,276,14014,13,445,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,409,60946,265,3846,7930,7010,1208,29079,13109,409,27750,10457,2249,11,10383,28130,86740,1370,3625,6681,329,1354,1880,3625,17258,784,3869,945,404,409,1208,80444,13,34447,33670,16968,11,934,17771,54312,934,22827,52962,1133,409,86451,757,13510,89,45325,30,19421,14707,7010,653,2317,68,39723,1208,17536,1826,409,5636,665,5636,25945,3288,68,1880,39723,3738,288,48577,308,6,546,6502,326,6,94411,294,6,14283,665,9467,3095,11,76076,10457,2249,513,2503,306,6316,57128,409,22848,978,13,19421,29557,10367,28463,259,6,329,1354,409,75249,6183,2058,11,409,1375,9011,9211,28130,34922,1880,28130,15907,993,4462,2492,3869,326,93847,8065,13612,321,11,8065,2092,1880,8065,10594,11,1880,1370,86633,27584,409,7591,7642,3625,4958,3978,2392,1880,3625,7643,484,2469,409,293,467,11,16968,22299,3869,1208,86451,13,62463,33726,43215,75460,10253,33726,78810,33903,14464,61244,96308,57705,978,6091,14014,1370,1208,33956,13109,11,514,6155,57332,1880,1208,312,2002,361,864,7521,306,2035,653,459,409,1370,51173,7010,51854,628,1154,78810,33903,37391,276,14014,8065,39002,409,326,6,1334,1880,409,1208,82291,13,62463,628,1154,80163,14014,4790,12059,294,31109,961,653,39474,51199,3869,326,77025,1330,586,11,39723,514,6681,32084,3567,1188,1180,12844,1880,2536,29121,1133,9618,11067,951,603,1154,409,829,39973,11,10071,28463,76776,653,39474,304,15433,822,8065,34922,11,39587,4864,841,80444,409,24811,18479,80664,306,3625,503,1468,318,5512,514,7591,3415,458,479,13,41621,47592,3738,1133,46939,11142,978,6316,48901,409,27750,52962,3808,7010,26317,26886,645,13,15663,1771,409,9189,15132,25692,85815,682,5512,3869,326,6,39749,23034,11,10071,3846,15132,4685,5512,8065,39002,409,326,93847,9952,4958,3978,2392,11,1589,25253,2092,12267,1880,7643,484,354,409,293,467,11,1880,76076,665,67683,969,1188,25692,85815,294,41901,2749,15878,297,805,3869,326,31769,4345,68,16081,13,19421,14707,93569,89,1474,6870,9189,13510,1744,27750,33726,841,3355,89810,6502,29121,1133,409,9189,11,1880,2536,9189,308,6,90276,6502,94773,48647,13,445,77025,1330,20272,1370,86633,409,9189,3846,934,35329,76605,13,2998,9189,9466,519,11,9189,296,6,52659,917,6091,1181,66,6388,294,22827,51854,79165,1765,27750,842,299,1220,42844,1647,77807,37093,13,41621,296,6,52659,917,6091,1370,51173,1744,951,33013,98942,409,89869,9952,326,41901,2842,40280,78810,467,11,259,6853,1744,1208,58482,85,7709,11,1208,30179,768,294,31109,281,6960,6033,1208,44178,16271,409,53052,11,9189,91878,3869,9189,1375,9011,9211,665,39973,13,622,34155,13550,285,1744,326,93847,9189,71751,6316,37392,951,781,625,3808,28463,14707,7891,8467,1744,2145,4088,11,7930,9189,91878,3869,9189,3127,52424,13,34447,503,34155,28463,24560,1448,680,978,1370,3625,9045,3116,45168,1370,76076,294,6,40997,9189,5019,27389,62219,28130,34922,294,6,39883,665,1437,28143,519,33670,294,6,14283,3869,326,49152,462,481,13,2998,16968,4865,11,11083,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,42676,9189,62299,1765,27750,16948,2492,2922,6496,11,274,1815,89,1744,4864,9189,23846,13,3206,9511,67763,3869,41091,11,1880,14707,11,272,17771,9189,13,14465,9406,1088,514,40970,409,9189,54409,7986,13,14465,9189,342,37093,13,19421,1370,86633,11,4864,3355,729,294,59858,3846,934,35329,259,26248,9952,9189,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,9189,20272,75802,11,49733,5636,272,6,74,352,12844,48647,409,9189,1375,9011,9211,1880,409,45347,665,45889,4520,6033,45889,2961,5615,880,812,409,26317,45188,409,42775,33670,8232,273,354,409,7363,818,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,
