{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:19:40.20536871Z","response":"I'd rate the persuasiveness of this speech as 3 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker starts off well by using a relatable anecdote from their childhood to connect with the audience. They also do a good job of setting up their research question and explaining the importance of understanding family dynamics in a species where family is not always present. The use of personal experience and self-deprecation can be endearing to the audience.\n\nHowever, as the speech goes on, it becomes more focused on sharing humorous observations about their own family rather than presenting rigorous reasoning or convincing arguments. The tone starts to feel more like a stand-up comedy routine than a scientific presentation. While humor can be effective in engaging an audience, it may not necessarily make the message more persuasive.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's decision to share their personal experiences and opinions (e.g., \"je me disais souvent...\") detracts from the scientific credibility of the presentation. A clearer distinction between personal anecdotes and research findings would be helpful.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some engaging moments, it could benefit from a stronger focus on presenting convincing arguments and maintaining a more formal tone.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,3869,26725,13,7671,519,409,9189,89504,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,91507,9189,15473,444,466,6316,38920,50750,1295,13,3489,438,503,31769,2629,285,38920,11,3900,308,59858,50590,55455,7930,296,10610,12339,3625,5636,1744,1647,46110,1448,12339,13,1952,1826,294,69537,541,11,4864,841,36731,6502,1208,86806,7010,20662,71632,13,19421,76776,11,42676,4864,5790,95920,2192,42138,6316,10878,86323,3869,326,31769,56745,11,1744,4864,436,5615,424,2192,409,20662,1589,25253,8065,72476,266,7930,43989,7010,514,1448,7992,11,1880,1744,4864,757,17634,82,951,42463,934,35329,50590,51296,978,1208,88818,13,65381,3846,4545,2922,6496,11,4864,757,834,2852,71151,11,10071,503,41901,94297,5636,409,20662,67628,13,19421,39043,11,272,17771,2800,261,665,34280,519,41091,42844,43905,7643,1156,7569,13109,13,19421,39587,11,3869,2961,1553,665,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,55162,10036,60946,265,326,31769,65272,409,3846,46838,561,265,3674,7930,1826,1208,17536,67628,13,19421,409,47929,4068,3869,1208,348,5615,79507,46206,3738,288,16948,4558,1634,1880,6502,46206,294,81979,13,12535,7010,1208,7138,17317,17258,85,2439,17317,38831,15170,9952,951,16948,4558,1634,3091,447,552,11,27549,1826,94773,3731,6960,11,22299,1370,51173,3625,1080,87,30808,645,1880,409,326,49455,265,39723,27549,11412,23761,12611,67763,13,1219,2727,1370,51173,46206,3625,3116,34965,11,39723,3625,56127,82133,27584,91878,28130,296,12339,3869,39929,35597,5636,409,1448,31539,1880,274,52822,1759,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,11,35597,40970,11,409,1589,25253,8065,72476,266,11,27549,308,6,546,55455,13550,285,13,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,39587,409,60946,265,326,31769,1195,29355,1880,514,5088,3675,409,20662,17536,409,67628,11,46206,6316,16948,4558,346,39723,27549,1826,73533,1413,13,62408,16948,4558,346,11,272,17771,514,78072,30630,13,46206,20662,665,346,46429,11,3625,86696,56311,18434,265,16968,74206,87451,1208,4415,24918,13,81245,14848,39587,1208,67239,978,294,49152,13603,6316,17536,409,67628,6033,6316,17536,2092,60224,13,19421,45602,757,29557,665,9511,67763,409,14951,8646,3625,1912,288,44526,53819,13,2100,275,665,665,33670,1208,296,12339,11,45441,665,13399,519,653,46110,3930,66167,409,27750,1448,31539,1880,274,52822,1759,13,362,32384,11,4864,91507,39587,68226,5363,261,326,31769,6232,1880,3625,84233,69,1238,409,20662,17536,44526,20487,13,27058,45602,11,4864,91507,75144,51854,11083,1439,13,423,22827,81337,11,951,24654,52962,1133,3916,11,22299,514,4272,82325,425,11,3625,17393,409,46798,1018,554,9465,3625,23496,355,11,1208,28699,40948,978,6033,1208,83170,53301,13,19421,409,326,49455,265,11,951,11083,1439,4571,72,1640,8467,1880,326,6,12828,3928,12267,11,22299,1208,85424,409,97418,11,514,27138,409,82620,11,1208,7550,648,1880,1208,90509,4998,3928,12267,3663,3869,951,1853,540,85798,13,34447,11,503,41901,36731,39723,9189,12584,89,757,7631,261,13,19421,14707,7216,89,45325,1744,46206,20662,16948,4558,346,11,272,17771,1208,296,12339,7930,60534,40744,3625,1589,66474,8065,72476,266,13,19421,3625,86696,82133,27584,274,6,24677,261,87451,4046,38828,52424,13,3206,45455,4558,325,5019,1208,16578,951,11083,1367,28154,2436,11,1880,39587,1744,1208,296,12339,87264,514,27138,409,2815,89,12,768,46429,11,653,85573,98304,11,1880,1744,3846,87264,3625,86696,7930,282,2473,1188,514,4272,82325,425,7930,6348,64,1188,20028,3625,14307,11,1880,7930,274,6,24719,2473,1188,294,58591,804,1208,84228,593,46206,514,32118,8332,258,13,13789,11,10071,39043,11,9189,841,274,34886,1744,7010,653,459,13,1952,65022,77433,3869,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,100164,7643,67628,653,28800,44178,1864,479,11,1880,27549,1826,6502,4502,8811,1913,54960,13,14465,73953,27584,934,81991,7643,65827,10431,409,270,4558,325,11,4864,18728,2192,3869,1647,259,333,1658,12339,11,6316,1589,25253,8065,72476,266,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,40,4265,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,420,8982,439,220,18,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,8638,1022,1664,555,1701,264,1375,15436,50750,1295,505,872,20587,311,4667,449,279,10877,13,2435,1101,656,264,1695,2683,315,6376,709,872,3495,3488,323,26073,279,12939,315,8830,3070,30295,304,264,9606,1405,3070,374,539,2744,3118,13,578,1005,315,4443,3217,323,659,6953,70693,649,387,842,13992,311,279,10877,627,198,11458,11,439,279,8982,5900,389,11,433,9221,810,10968,389,11821,70946,24654,922,872,1866,3070,4856,1109,32644,47999,33811,477,40661,6105,13,578,16630,8638,311,2733,810,1093,264,2559,5352,
