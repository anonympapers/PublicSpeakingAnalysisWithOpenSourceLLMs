Is their reasoning rigorous?\"\n\nBased on my analysis, I would give a score of **4** out of 5. The speaker is quite persuasive in that they:\n\n1. Use engaging analogies (e.g., comparing femtos to a fraction of a second) to help the audience understand complex concepts.\n2. Explain technical terms and scientific principles in simple language, making them accessible to a broader audience.\n3. Highlight the potential benefits of their research, such as reducing CO2 emissions, which can resonate with listeners' concerns about climate change.\n4. Show enthusiasm and passion for their work, which is contagious and can inspire others.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that some parts of the speech might feel a bit too casual or informal, potentially detracting from the overall persuasiveness. For example, the speaker's use of colloquialisms (e.g., \"So yez en fou et Ã©tant ton le...\") might not be as effective in convincing all listeners.\n\nOverall, however, I think this speech is quite persuasive and effectively conveys the excitement and importance of the research being discussed!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3489,438,9189,14240,74466,46110,11,9189,1860,74466,59148,1653,1208,5634,20712,1880,27750,34692,409,10474,13,34447,2536,11,308,6,352,10333,6502,1069,324,11,9189,4635,2852,53070,25945,14707,13,5034,5634,20712,25692,513,30179,1992,32592,56321,14240,1900,13,11730,2428,11,12046,579,1880,56086,13,19421,6316,9320,409,10474,1826,16968,71357,653,2609,1133,294,57286,266,13,4366,51173,11,42676,9189,2322,668,89,326,93847,8065,99898,978,5185,324,5019,39929,951,2840,580,2439,1880,2098,969,25108,331,404,15265,4671,263,329,75,39883,11,1880,14707,11,9189,20272,288,6316,9320,409,10474,11,44829,593,326,93847,39904,409,326,57286,266,12046,579,13,46408,1826,1089,337,579,13,14465,36731,6316,270,4558,325,665,64441,3869,14539,13737,83,26584,1765,3625,34692,409,10474,7010,3625,2092,3422,13,2998,20272,11,4864,52571,3869,43678,653,36252,278,665,653,47838,13,11842,11,4864,841,91507,6502,43678,514,3197,665,477,22299,326,54386,9517,85,51453,3625,34361,318,75460,11,13080,28130,991,501,2925,13,34447,4864,91507,20028,64972,13,14465,52571,3869,20028,951,2609,3808,409,6070,24955,76608,7010,11083,37565,7930,3073,306,7010,514,17536,409,26725,3625,49301,13,650,978,2429,1880,37565,7930,308,58736,18620,6502,7010,1208,7138,13,19421,272,76832,11,665,45889,5103,43681,2132,288,11,6316,5103,43681,2132,288,11,272,17771,6316,38920,19983,409,513,95959,11,653,3610,818,409,2606,81560,294,39982,66474,409,2132,288,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4502,9189,77554,978,23577,326,6,9011,713,409,326,22827,1986,7930,264,951,2606,81560,1880,951,2606,81560,294,6,1036,14014,11,1880,14707,6316,5103,43681,2132,288,11,1370,39474,3869,6316,513,95959,11,272,17771,28463,5590,11,934,31109,77818,11,1370,39474,3869,326,6,9011,713,409,326,22827,1986,13,356,17771,2609,1133,409,6070,3709,3433,481,479,76608,11,15132,665,3930,3284,75804,88253,77433,3869,951,21120,24955,1824,2530,13,3959,1344,1154,409,41263,20712,7930,841,294,77065,1744,45889,43386,33903,409,5103,43681,2132,288,13,1708,1105,503,6,2706,81356,1744,9189,274,45620,89,1744,26725,3625,75601,2439,308,6,546,6502,1208,27584,6070,13,41621,47592,3625,75601,2439,26944,645,9952,951,19670,288,7930,369,479,6316,6070,17251,1880,15528,13,24703,308,17771,6502,514,4865,951,75601,2601,294,6,6581,3372,285,14014,1370,1208,7138,11,22299,514,27527,13,19421,97507,11,26725,3625,75601,2439,308,41901,16948,80156,11,1437,5512,978,11,4046,3427,685,11,6070,13,356,17771,22299,39043,13,1708,1105,1826,54312,1744,514,27527,5019,969,653,9880,409,96586,35482,949,19421,14707,11,272,17771,51625,285,42625,3846,1744,4864,52571,3869,20028,11,7010,11083,47590,13,622,6,3239,6870,3869,326,6,4105,324,5103,43681,513,95959,1765,514,27527,1880,4864,52571,13,5034,51651,10878,8047,11,1208,51651,25228,13109,11,1208,51651,4046,64374,3930,21120,5019,1744,514,27527,665,653,9888,2349,409,6070,1880,409,3355,26193,11,3900,379,264,28463,35482,13,19421,326,55624,14081,49530,11,272,17771,934,35329,40142,409,80080,21744,10515,5512,7930,29557,376,546,81186,409,9517,1072,556,326,31769,2796,409,7432,17,1370,3625,88486,1759,13,435,2259,1001,11,3625,6952,1820,5364,17,2132,288,11,272,17771,653,46110,28800,22299,326,31769,16876,13109,951,17393,389,21559,5636,3869,66056,7930,14848,326,6,2159,1133,13,1708,1105,3846,1744,4864,9189,15473,46452,326,6,9011,713,11,3625,28463,15473,444,466,3869,653,505,1435,11,1880,3900,296,26248,10045,978,294,82405,10670,27750,72475,11,27750,505,1154,1370,326,6,64588,2727,1370,21120,13,1708,1105,3937,8065,65385,11,4864,25400,834,25692,85815,1744,25692,85815,6502,757,8631,261,653,31269,361,13,19421,44829,42138,26725,3625,3625,6952,1820,5364,17,2132,288,29557,73468,409,46932,265,665,2167,951,9517,4109,38094,8467,11,409,20028,951,1200,14081,811,409,1208,272,6526,266,11,409,18027,261,951,51423,13,1708,1105,951,505,1154,1913,5512,1370,21120,20263,12,5159,409,13510,87320,6502,13,2100,9188,89,665,57625,1880,14240,519,8941,514,11,1841,46845,1873,13,356,17771,4068,308,58591,414,261,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,36815,4999,198,1271,15806,279,24613,300,13071,315,420,8982,11,358,690,2980,279,13167,330,4438,13750,1587,279,1732,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,7673,198,198,29815,389,856,6492,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,13,578,19114,374,5115,66343,304,430,814,512,198,16,13,5560,23387,24291,552,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,5103,43681,311,264,19983,315,264,2132,8,311,1520,279,10877,3619,64
