{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:15:08.387185318Z","response":"What a fascinating speech!\n\nBased on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of this speech as **4** out of 5.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The speaker delivers a well-structured argument, starting with a clear thesis statement about the failure to combat radicalization in France.\n2. They use logical reasoning and provide examples (e.g., comparing Madrid, London, and Paris) to support their claims.\n3. The speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices, such as metaphors (e.g., \"la joue de toujours plus de morale\") and allusions (e.g., \"l'homme et les choses ont un jus de du malheure au monde\"), to add emotional depth and engage the audience.\n4. They also provide specific examples from the Plan national de pr√©vention de la radicalisation, which shows that they have done their homework and are familiar with the topic.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the speech could benefit from more concrete solutions or proposals for addressing radicalization. While the speaker highlights some of the problems, they don't offer clear alternatives or recommendations for moving forward.\n\nOverall, this is a compelling and thought-provoking speech that effectively argues for change in France's approach to combating radicalization.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,25048,11,80693,417,1880,12366,13,19881,285,26886,645,11,56321,94320,645,409,39973,11,1448,680,14014,294,39346,1370,951,52309,1900,20320,288,3930,439,593,389,917,6853,1208,18336,8082,13,1708,1105,11,3663,3869,20662,81695,11,3625,17258,3415,17260,586,82,665,9822,15132,5906,665,2035,951,6787,409,63922,668,45973,1208,18336,8082,11,10071,7930,13509,54960,893,593,409,34501,43078,13109,13,27058,62998,949,356,17771,326,22827,951,13878,1744,4864,9781,635,7010,7643,270,4558,325,1880,1744,17317,682,2439,46131,40126,13,2009,1665,333,409,20662,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,409,68226,2579,263,1215,34501,43078,13109,1880,31914,582,13109,3869,27750,6787,13,1708,1105,11,934,17771,54312,934,35329,841,11412,6502,9952,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,44829,593,272,17771,27549,7930,1826,665,5353,294,6,370,541,949,46408,308,26248,6502,409,6070,13,452,59858,16422,307,2428,11,308,59858,7330,52760,13,4366,51173,11,7010,514,60697,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,757,36731,92759,978,8065,3197,5426,409,27389,7611,409,1208,18336,8082,78511,8047,665,220,679,23,1370,514,85182,40280,13,19421,3869,15878,1773,788,312,9868,11,389,25692,379,46131,514,3937,18336,8082,10071,6502,6316,86806,37291,11,3846,1744,39043,76605,13510,13,432,5512,495,266,11,9189,62299,48647,11,308,6,2295,652,39883,1370,7010,20662,23035,22299,7970,9189,97487,13,64105,64,11,272,17771,514,21134,1486,13,1611,2249,34695,546,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,11,27549,841,5965,57609,6502,13,46408,834,1788,57609,11,27549,264,7015,817,13,19421,665,3846,4865,11,27549,264,28068,978,3869,1208,28068,68,409,44093,5636,409,63683,11,44093,5636,294,6,17060,6082,11,44093,5636,409,72597,11,44093,5636,409,72597,665,65268,13,34447,56316,5636,11,272,17771,326,83508,10045,11,503,34155,348,19395,978,8376,978,11,10071,514,10045,1826,3062,11,66090,2922,6496,11,272,17771,56316,5636,409,6225,13,64105,64,11,272,17771,514,26633,90272,1486,13,19421,514,8348,13532,25253,1486,11,272,17771,1744,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,11,27549,834,346,5455,653,25945,8811,11,3846,7930,1826,16033,409,3846,7930,1826,63828,16876,13,12095,6316,18694,409,1925,76605,88286,514,2539,38921,11,3930,9880,8065,39580,93658,11,5019,48908,3869,1208,15562,978,409,18336,8082,11,409,18336,44618,11,39723,294,6,23265,309,44618,11,28800,1179,68,13,27058,3154,519,11,3869,259,6853,11,514,64079,63828,43310,409,514,20028,11,409,514,88286,13,507,2005,11,39587,15562,261,26077,447,22827,409,20028,79071,14896,409,63828,16876,11,39043,11,272,17771,15562,13,1708,1105,934,17771,54312,934,54386,25692,20028,294,6,370,541,11,3900,47090,71751,3869,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,6316,5636,25626,91558,16271,8065,64079,11,66021,1744,514,64079,1826,72450,11,1208,63683,841,3625,961,13,14465,94297,23008,9211,653,69067,409,64079,11,4864,94297,6502,23008,9211,653,69067,409,63683,13,2998,51092,11,389,841,25692,6502,1208,74333,1765,653,27584,3197,1880,9952,653,27584,98020,11,1208,18336,8082,11,6316,54613,7930,87264,48901,409,1208,1709,67100,1880,6316,47838,7930,513,2322,376,2979,1188,3869,18434,265,665,3941,409,622,978,14717,582,28997,79566,11,14596,3102,11,350,1923,65,3102,13,356,17771,6502,3284,13,19421,44829,11,3900,47090,62439,29449,85722,409,7591,5589,404,3625,79165,13,4366,3625,18336,56276,11,272,17771,21965,40146,13,4366,3625,294,6,9035,44618,4738,812,11,272,17771,5636,51625,285,13,4366,3625,409,4371,2642,44618,11,17317,17317,917,79717,55455,13,4366,3625,26633,1912,288,31398,75460,11,65268,1880,5636,1206,1334,13,19421,44829,11,3900,47090,88661,1143,22633,1155,409,55162,385,404,29905,12329,951,8045,754,645,11,22299,91116,409,28417,285,13,445,6339,45973,1208,18336,8082,3869,6800,16081,409,51223,9780,37526,11,272,17771,25945,503,14559,11,10071,39043,757,76605,55455,13510,13,13203,2259,1001,11,17971,8215,355,50590,73173,11,3869,8811,11,326,6,87713,1880,3625,79165,14848,653,45907,409,3930,8811,75876,8065,38900,13,14465,841,550,10515,408,6502,3869,88286,5636,409,7970,383,324,9952,42067,29005,713,11,503,6,25632,12339,653,28800,5636,409,77463,1880,409,45602,13,14465,1446,2852,14707,77818,2249,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,8982,4999,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,420,8982,439,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,627,198,8586,596,3249,512,198,16,13,578,19114,28421,264,1664,12,52243,5811,11,6041,449,264,2867,17850,5224,922,279,8060,311,12896,18336,2065,304,9822,13,198,17,13,2435,1005,20406,33811,323,3493,105
