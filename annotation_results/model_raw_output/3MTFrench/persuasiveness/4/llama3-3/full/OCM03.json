{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:16:42.787346125Z","response":"**Evaluation**\n\nAfter reviewing the transcript, I would rate the persuasive power of the speech as **4/5**, where 1 is \"not at all\" and 5 is \"very much\".\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by:\n\n1. Establishing a connection with the audience through storytelling and vivid descriptions.\n2. Using rhetorical devices such as metaphors (e.g., \"vent, c'est le lien Ã  la terre\") and repetition (\"t'a revoir\").\n3. Showcasing their expertise in viticulture and terroir through specific examples and data.\n4. Emphasizing the importance of understanding typicity and its impact on wine production.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the speech could be improved:\n\n1. The speaker occasionally uses overly complex vocabulary (e.g., \"analyse sans s'arriel\") that might confuse some listeners.\n2. There is a lack of direct argumentation or explicit reasoning in some parts of the speech, which could make it harder to follow for some audience members.\n\nOverall, I believe the speaker's engaging style and passion for their subject matter make their message more persuasive than not.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,58439,35213,11,17576,978,11,21455,52985,294,55624,729,13109,9952,15907,8554,11,951,281,1238,1880,409,16392,13,12103,18003,44618,1826,4502,281,10515,484,519,934,35329,513,20272,1685,593,9090,31037,13,41621,514,9517,884,33438,1880,294,58591,882,11083,20043,2249,11,4864,91507,9189,89504,77558,13,27058,48488,294,6,40997,9189,11,503,98279,24281,1744,514,10594,11,272,17771,33670,16968,6316,712,49363,40574,978,481,11,3869,917,81,20243,1291,665,67628,11,665,53345,648,1880,9952,1647,7591,2214,13,27058,41091,11,514,10594,11,272,17771,514,55520,3869,1208,88026,13,3489,438,9189,91329,2182,89,665,93892,414,3972,89504,409,15907,348,1771,11,409,15907,93892,288,11,409,4538,259,26248,312,35573,11,3900,513,39904,79071,14896,409,4983,2428,13,34447,272,17771,75249,514,259,26248,312,35573,949,356,17771,1208,3698,2259,3416,294,22827,2092,11,294,22827,11323,266,1880,409,95234,2854,8511,13,2998,4606,11,3625,259,26248,312,35573,3869,650,75907,645,15132,312,5259,355,1370,3625,264,454,14014,11,3625,53051,811,294,6,4775,483,1760,19395,14014,11,7930,7591,5589,79738,39723,1880,4068,389,25692,2558,556,3930,10594,13,34447,27750,264,454,14014,51625,79738,28463,1744,514,259,26248,312,35573,11,13080,389,11412,28130,89504,93892,414,11,934,54386,20028,8065,10594,11,3625,57705,978,2889,8467,15878,274,41901,9517,301,54008,20712,11,79245,3869,26725,13,41621,3665,89,272,17771,653,28800,22299,15265,477,11,15265,274,89412,13,41621,47592,25692,85815,3625,123299,9004,20043,2249,11,10071,6502,3625,123299,9004,3091,588,2249,13,19421,14707,11,3900,665,11412,409,27584,5019,3625,10594,294,53149,978,2354,13,2998,20272,11,665,259,6,82301,404,11,272,17771,22299,6316,25626,67628,409,10594,13,19421,42067,1826,653,409,67628,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,389,326,53149,6853,11,7643,3666,292,13109,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,409,46524,6316,98652,5019,14240,664,1291,1208,3666,292,13109,409,54021,32592,917,978,2354,294,6,4775,483,1760,19395,8047,13,22652,1208,60946,265,11,10071,28463,64972,9189,665,89504,13,445,6,1617,5397,1744,503,49963,1082,11,272,17771,326,6,44803,325,15878,274,6,277,22811,13,507,2005,11,3900,1080,30872,668,3930,10594,5019,1208,8198,11,4864,63762,13,34447,33670,409,7591,30038,11,3900,47090,513,1153,261,3625,9120,14295,4860,11,75144,3625,7970,4978,75601,2601,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,16343,409,96642,7177,409,326,6,44803,325,15878,274,6,277,22811,11,9952,51854,281,10610,2053,409,7591,1072,4523,324,11,514,16968,1765,6316,43386,8511,294,53149,978,2354,9517,4581,648,7010,326,22827,951,5636,94527,93892,4893,3930,38900,11,514,96282,294,6,511,2177,72,13,356,17771,934,31109,259,10610,8047,514,5636,1645,3035,569,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,356,96287,409,48021,3625,93892,269,2439,8065,12541,3930,1920,355,13,3341,3846,15132,409,28800,1744,1208,25551,80757,292,13109,11,3846,33651,2249,3805,409,67628,13,14465,3625,16796,39587,51010,28111,8047,1370,917,978,2354,5019,3625,958,299,1414,1765,326,6,472,569,11,1880,1765,28130,10594,13,356,3433,978,41091,653,57951,409,93892,269,2439,11,326,6,1137,625,269,264,3666,292,13109,11,39043,20272,5636,1744,220,5245,2132,288,13,34447,42138,39929,81621,951,76145,3869,712,556,28130,49361,11,4864,3625,16796,1709,41984,978,5553,653,24757,74775,34561,5019,7591,68019,3625,57705,978,2889,8467,15878,274,6,277,22811,3666,2428,409,28130,10594,13,5186,12416,75249,11,3625,93892,269,2439,294,31769,7697,357,54817,3869,1208,5320,361,11,1880,49586,89,27750,57705,978,2889,8467,5019,75871,265,3869,1208,3488,11,3846,10594,1826,3666,2428,409,15265,917,978,2354,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,42138,39929,11430,978,9952,951,2960,33903,409,72700,269,2439,1880,116848,951,2606,4918,409,60514,409,10594,11,4864,60946,82,64972,27750,38546,2138,31355,11,28130,55520,8065,8818,1880,43153,887,3095,951,6225,802,462,1147,13,34447,514,12717,11,272,17771,1744,503,34155,100162,6316,98652,5019,14240,664,1291,1208,11813,292,13109,409,54021,32592,917,978,2354,294,6,4775,483,1760,19395,8047,13,1611,1925,11,20662,98652,757,29557,2221,409,64972,9189,89504,409,10594,13,362,32384,11,9189,5019,23577,90194,5636,51794,479,9465,3625,4809,588,4618,2249,348,11178,2922,6,526,361,294,69537,28787,4618,2249,13,24082,263,1744,9189,27389,59958,23577,3625,308,1900,409,87885,15760,11,6033,3625,308,1900,409,16392,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,83463,334,198,198,6153,34988,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,66343,2410,315,279,8982,439,3146,19,14,20,98319,1405,
