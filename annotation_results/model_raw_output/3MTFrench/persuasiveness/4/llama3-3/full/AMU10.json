The use of examples from popular culture, such as the famous phrase \"Vous avez le droit...\", adds humor and makes the topic more relatable.\n\nThe reasoning is also rigorous, as the speaker presents a clear thesis statement about the importance of understanding the rights of suspects in criminal investigations and provides supporting arguments through various anecdotes and examples. The use of logical connections between ideas helps to build a cohesive argument.\n\nHowever, I would deduct one point because some parts of the speech may come across as somewhat rhetorical or overly dramatic, such as the phrase \"Créhé libre\" (a play on words that may not be immediately clear to all listeners). Additionally, some of the examples used may not be directly relevant to the main topic, which could potentially detract from the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nOverall, I believe the speaker effectively crafts a convincing message and presents a rigorous argument, making this speech a strong 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,41621,47592,514,64079,409,22641,261,514,21847,13,80905,3846,1744,9189,5534,74466,5019,1208,23761,409,259,1509,45973,9189,77558,653,63992,13,41621,47592,514,64079,665,7671,31866,11,4502,9189,308,41901,47592,6502,3625,52138,729,11,3900,9189,665,87264,1081,285,653,92860,19195,13,34447,294,22827,11083,9622,46138,11,9189,47592,26725,69379,84,20662,17571,7010,6316,47528,1499,3457,12339,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,22011,1208,54613,3869,934,85217,3625,77807,37093,1759,274,6,61375,665,27750,4751,288,7010,27750,19266,4108,13,2009,15562,13,1219,2727,514,20605,265,11,514,64160,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,3869,409,3846,15562,13,2009,15562,274,17771,38605,8376,301,978,1880,514,15562,55467,13,5034,7809,57288,409,1208,6671,3930,15562,7010,3625,26633,21935,3869,5019,326,55624,14081,49530,7330,52760,11,294,6,16288,3625,97222,409,66090,63484,1880,409,7591,23827,261,3625,44178,63934,288,1880,3625,594,28111,3095,13,27058,62998,4864,296,55624,978,22550,3869,20662,54613,425,8792,409,326,41901,447,37093,30,4366,346,1744,16968,409,11679,12339,11,514,15562,1826,15550,86396,13,356,17771,514,6730,29982,263,409,1208,13988,15433,554,281,10610,1604,13,7695,326,26248,51854,3608,35933,13,7127,2852,32592,51854,53051,811,13,7695,1826,77411,3869,48371,7218,71686,3869,1208,41263,20712,951,1495,288,409,82291,13,24703,5276,519,3869,1208,16578,409,326,41901,447,37093,11,3900,3567,1188,13,34447,665,7151,268,11,44829,26589,978,13,1708,1105,11,5019,514,60946,265,11,22299,4349,81487,11,4864,296,41901,447,37093,13,622,34155,9964,22011,3625,15285,13,423,6,370,541,11,3625,11083,1439,6223,5983,409,22848,978,10253,447,37907,3900,25692,23761,5945,34965,7010,3625,26633,21935,13,2876,64656,1208,33651,817,11,3900,379,264,409,1208,48234,13,41621,3665,89,11,20662,84921,7930,6824,68,3869,2800,261,3869,1208,46096,951,77807,37093,1759,220,1187,76145,5019,75871,265,3869,43153,4860,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,3900,1826,64284,409,326,6,5673,263,66522,951,97222,42844,27750,220,1187,76145,8065,10025,593,409,514,46131,3869,62323,1179,68,13,7695,13550,285,13,3489,438,653,3703,65,30872,75,665,3698,2259,3416,9517,283,713,11,274,6,306,99057,285,519,1370,1208,8590,10670,1880,409,85434,11,308,17771,6502,665,3698,2259,3416,11,10071,841,20272,1744,15471,38149,951,78418,12249,13,4656,978,71,978,48647,13,2998,51092,11,4864,91507,45347,3869,1208,513,95959,48901,409,7643,57485,1133,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,14465,91507,296,804,6316,77807,37093,409,88026,13,14465,91507,296,804,6316,2960,8511,294,6,2295,12184,4428,3946,11,10071,6502,1744,409,15562,13,46706,934,26248,40095,409,4983,122682,11,294,49152,511,277,11,951,48577,7930,55162,4355,1188,3625,4684,1220,11,308,6,546,6502,1208,17536,409,45347,1765,514,1099,321,13,27058,62998,1826,54312,63484,3062,949,4366,346,1744,514,15562,11,16968,22299,9189,11,16968,22299,41091,11,1826,27389,1264,978,87018,6960,13,1952,25692,26725,23761,15562,13,7695,8657,275,409,43919,2058,326,55624,14081,49530,409,1208,4379,13,1611,1370,15907,1448,978,17187,811,11,10071,25692,10539,60019,23200,261,6316,54613,3869,15907,1448,978,17187,811,11,503,59858,294,6,52659,409,25945,7970,4978,1448,978,17187,811,949,622,34155,15925,665,326,6,14310,21201,13,4366,3625,27138,7930,5590,11,3900,1826,35597,5636,4382,294,93825,15562,13,19421,8657,275,294,49152,13603,653,85182,40280,98020,653,28800,21965,19126,95710,5019,514,36963,11,81186,1208,88818,8541,685,17508,14991,11,514,342,21268,11,5019,1651,8023,1208,24408,409,1208,4379,1880,6502,1744,409,1208,4379,409,1208,3941,13,36684,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,514,4160,321,7930,17317,19266,3462,3930,15562,1826,19227,1001,296,2648,1744,3625,97222,1744,3625,15132,312,5259,355,15132,28463,3625,308,35657,417,13,4242,4558,325,11412,29557,10367,294,31769,74199,404,653,5410,8187,951,97222,3930,15562,11,294,94572,15273,12155,97222,11,409,27750,56321,15132,3625,447,37907,514,64079,665,13988,978,978,447,15729,841,25692,23761,40192,648,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,264,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,87068,7766,1778,439,54515,3573,273,15562,4063,46450,3573,11860,29982,263,409,1208,13988,15433,554,281,10610,1604,4063,323,48929,12823,311,16988,279,10877,13,578,1005,315,10507,505,5526,7829,11,1778,439,279,11495,17571,330,43273,47592,514,64079,47944,11
