Starting with a relatable story that grabs the audience's attention.\n2. Providing a clear explanation of their research and its implications.\n3. Using analogies (e.g., comparing brain networks to transportation systems) to make complex concepts more accessible.\n4. Showing enthusiasm and passion for their work, which is infectious.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that the speaker's reasoning could be considered somewhat simplified or overly optimistic in some parts. For example, while they acknowledge the limitations of their method (i.e., not accounting for all possible factors), they might have been more explicit about potential biases or uncertainties.\n\nOverall, however, I think the speaker does an excellent job of presenting their research and its significance in a way that is engaging and easy to understand!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,74699,14240,277,119990,3869,326,39982,9769,79,2223,908,266,409,72709,13,46408,43989,7010,514,34561,11,16578,3869,653,11677,11,10071,75804,88253,3869,326,26248,6033,1653,3625,20043,2249,1880,5363,7010,514,17536,635,13,46408,1826,5320,484,8047,11,10071,841,97487,6502,74365,409,3846,7930,513,39904,90053,294,80720,13,14465,25400,1370,273,13,9589,54312,934,80720,11540,6960,949,11876,6978,15132,77554,14081,5512,28093,56447,4502,841,9517,351,79738,56316,10253,64609,288,42676,326,6,22231,818,13,4366,51173,11,272,17771,9517,1543,1133,11,5363,978,665,3122,13,34447,220,3174,1034,951,6978,15132,8811,15439,519,665,42587,519,71686,42067,1826,346,409,52962,1133,13,1952,3625,14425,275,28093,56447,3869,5801,265,13,3206,719,1826,294,22827,2606,1291,1291,1880,3846,15439,665,14240,41939,11,28130,272,5976,2933,13,44564,272,5976,2933,1826,653,98947,409,308,6,269,30052,25945,6485,68,13,48109,44314,2439,409,220,1490,3869,220,1041,2606,81560,294,48968,44486,294,93847,95917,359,4046,6323,11828,9465,220,16,931,1880,220,605,220,931,4635,327,919,9952,294,81979,308,6,269,30052,13,12095,389,1391,1037,29449,98947,84850,4558,21152,3869,326,22827,98947,409,7710,11,46777,88100,84850,4558,21152,264,71925,9465,6316,39973,13,11876,4635,327,919,9465,27750,38682,919,409,71368,15844,3625,27865,5612,13,11876,4160,42204,7930,4319,29580,1765,27750,11543,91678,306,1208,10758,98151,34395,9465,3625,38682,919,13,62463,1879,12249,98151,462,14295,934,54386,38831,83384,1765,326,31769,376,582,8047,409,326,31769,772,299,665,27750,1343,278,13255,9004,11,15132,665,49564,5512,665,42587,519,951,7970,4978,409,220,5154,98151,299,5919,29960,14014,1765,1208,83067,951,6978,13,507,2005,11,9952,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,4864,52895,375,6316,98652,409,5935,304,78,688,68,7930,17317,29557,409,7591,23827,261,1208,18003,2428,951,9517,325,12249,84850,4558,65,417,1218,268,9517,2053,13,2998,14240,41939,514,89714,2254,1880,3728,409,326,6,26125,7010,514,272,5976,2933,13,14465,94297,39587,7591,23827,261,3625,18713,9225,811,7010,1208,35855,409,326,6,26125,9465,27750,38682,919,13,622,34155,100162,1744,46206,3625,6978,28093,2445,4167,11,3846,15132,951,38682,919,294,6,275,2960,46140,6033,7598,7930,15132,25945,11857,14014,13,3489,301,1826,514,436,57332,409,27750,38682,919,7598,949,38891,89,934,35329,379,107902,951,78167,1880,3625,2961,49530,409,34480,2960,969,645,11,841,15132,6502,409,4958,404,13,1952,40142,6316,18713,65916,24906,461,7010,1208,35855,409,34480,1880,54613,841,5019,969,3869,23761,3869,829,9284,13,356,17771,514,27584,4865,7010,514,272,5976,2933,13,12095,3625,38682,919,7598,15132,11857,14014,11,1208,35855,409,326,6,26125,1826,18713,9225,8047,1880,308,26248,259,6,6802,13559,514,3728,409,272,5976,2933,7010,3846,4865,11,514,8893,1826,28093,2445,4167,13,14465,36731,39587,682,978,424,3869,52895,716,653,47838,64160,25945,51794,3869,75144,1880,7930,5019,969,91878,3625,32118,8332,1354,3869,64972,1891,8372,72684,28130,8893,13,38891,89,45575,514,13836,3531,5019,1208,67628,294,22827,459,7930,274,17771,74699,934,80720,3625,69379,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,36815,4999,198,29815,389,856,16865,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,512,198,16,13,28757,449,264,1375,15436,3446,430,49155,279,10877,596,6666,13,198,17,13,81200,264,2867,16540,315,872,3495,323,1202,25127,13,198,18,13,12362,24291,552,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,8271,14488,311,18386,6067,8,311,1304,6485,19476,810,15987,13,198,19,13,72030,36232,323,11939,369,872,990,11,902,374,50600,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,220,20,704,315,220,20,374,430,279,19114,596,33811,1436,387,6646,14738,44899,477,39532,37036,304,1063,5596,13,1789,3187,11,1418,814,25670,279,9669,315,872,1749,320,72,13,68,2637,539,24043,369,682,3284,9547,705,814,2643,617,1027,810,11720,922,4754,50183,477,69867,627,198,28589,11,4869,11,358,1781,279,19114,1587,459,9250,2683,315,32644,872,3495,323,1202,26431,304,264,1648,430,374,23387,323,4228,311,3619,0,128009],"total_duration":7281186563,"load_duration":157828,"prompt_eval_count":740,"prompt_eval_duration":1412827000,"eval_count":196,"eval_duration":5867738000}
