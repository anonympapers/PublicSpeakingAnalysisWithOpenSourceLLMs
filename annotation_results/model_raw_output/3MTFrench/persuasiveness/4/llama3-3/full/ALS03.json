They also demonstrate a good understanding of the topic and its importance in the context of sustainable development.\n\nThe reasoning is generally rigorous, with clear explanations of the concepts involved. The speaker uses concrete examples to illustrate their points, which helps to keep the audience engaged.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give it a perfect score because:\n\n1. Some sections feel a bit too technical or jargon-heavy (e.g., when discussing production and extraction). While the speaker is trying to simplify complex ideas, some listeners might still find these parts hard to follow.\n2. The speech could benefit from a stronger conclusion that ties everything together more explicitly. The final sentence feels a bit abrupt.\n\nOverall, I think this is an engaging and thought-provoking speech that effectively conveys the importance of understanding a city's metabolism in order to promote sustainable development.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,41901,4039,1604,409,83491,648,11,6316,38920,523,349,7930,274,53149,6853,921,13884,266,13,921,13884,266,11,4864,25400,21559,26725,3625,49301,50026,220,1135,69225,288,409,14425,52806,13,39783,37291,653,342,52424,11,15907,14425,24181,2392,82133,513,43678,7010,4538,2942,44618,1880,3127,52424,3625,10184,6417,812,1880,3625,4046,39624,552,934,80720,687,72,89810,5019,25400,29557,10367,409,2800,261,8065,1948,409,829,57128,13,362,1208,1913,3930,1920,355,11,3900,66167,45889,7591,331,1441,1744,921,13884,266,1826,9467,84,32592,57128,409,38920,272,5646,13,5034,10484,13109,294,83508,3904,3869,342,52424,11,1208,76407,15890,3900,513,5276,68,7010,326,6,8629,44618,1880,3846,7930,665,594,7003,11,16968,39043,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,514,32118,6323,337,44618,294,22827,2942,44618,13,34447,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,88704,68,13,14465,308,34155,9964,22011,6502,3625,47120,288,18434,1821,13,14465,36731,74672,540,4714,383,1880,503,34155,9964,22011,951,7317,6491,3946,11,951,26886,645,11,951,38682,919,11,951,21935,13,19421,27584,4502,27750,7317,6491,3946,308,6,546,6502,6800,14896,3869,46131,9952,921,13884,266,11,46152,14848,84440,28463,653,32118,6323,337,44618,13,38891,89,6316,39973,22299,653,25500,10065,7010,514,43014,17317,829,324,919,26725,665,79071,80444,951,13509,2482,13,19421,14707,5019,1744,3846,25500,10065,13458,326,6,29116,68976,44829,325,34501,1215,11,272,17771,3869,13510,5019,1744,3625,4635,327,1800,3233,17317,3567,546,29905,12329,951,594,40751,11,951,453,12843,3930,66304,11,3930,281,10515,5898,11,951,32118,2629,2249,11,5099,2637,5099,13,48109,841,893,331,2439,4046,1325,336,479,6502,60019,40744,27750,594,40751,11,10071,17317,3625,1615,316,24483,11,3625,5276,2439,1880,3625,436,2784,82,10390,1395,11,16968,22299,921,13884,266,11,934,54386,1794,2727,11,5276,68,1880,938,73,6672,27750,14425,24181,2392,13,12095,4864,5320,2249,47929,3846,1744,921,13884,266,934,54386,1794,2727,11,272,17771,308,17771,6502,25945,77411,13,7695,8657,275,409,1153,261,27750,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,11,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,80720,841,60534,55455,294,49455,265,665,61387,6672,13,34447,5019,47929,3846,1744,934,54386,1794,2727,6033,938,73,6672,528,14081,67763,11,1208,259,9011,1557,1826,47838,479,5636,6485,68,11,1880,3900,379,264,48488,11,48488,409,46681,3869,51010,36501,13,5034,5788,40574,292,1286,11,326,58736,27523,1332,12339,11,3625,938,73,118904,31539,326,6,1334,5553,326,93847,11,1208,57459,665,7591,14215,11,514,7710,409,15572,438,5014,11,1880,14707,294,49455,265,13,9648,2426,11,43905,5634,20712,2389,2159,361,11,3846,15132,51854,43386,33903,409,11990,409,52021,7930,4319,29580,46777,76132,1765,653,7317,6491,556,22299,326,6,2149,89,1394,13,362,32384,11,1647,42775,1826,409,52895,716,3625,75601,2601,7930,17634,306,5636,4382,1880,5636,51794,11,326,57286,799,3930,32118,6323,337,44618,409,12155,7317,6491,3946,11,665,29557,61512,409,51010,36501,1880,294,6,69331,2058,40744,27750,46681,13,27058,45602,11,389,6141,3357,324,1339,653,4958,84048,25945,8791,458,13,5186,12416,39929,3608,90859,514,955,294,6,26125,934,35329,47090,14951,8646,11,1880,52895,716,653,18629,7591,8747,978,11,4864,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,26125,13,356,8458,757,29557,409,75871,265,5636,51794,479,3869,96642,4860,3869,31632,409,46681,1437,2142,11,7930,4747,306,6033,312,15769,409,75249,11,6033,42676,11,1880,665,45889,1218,35933,13,14465,1446,2192,653,294,57286,275,3675,7930,76605,48021,7930,40142,8065,38682,547,11,4864,757,1153,261,2192,3625,123299,9004,4860,11,10071,3846,308,17771,6502,7930,264,9024,934,35329,47090,48021,8065,38682,547,13,24703,15132,14707,539,978,29141,3946,7930,4747,306,21965,409,594,40751,665,16968,4865,5636,1744,3846,1744,1208,3197,66522,841,25692,5790,283,899,261,13,362,32384,11,9952,1647,42775,11,503,6,25632,12339,75831,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,653,43453,36252,1291,294,58736,1601,13,39783,80444,409,1891,10515,275,3675,3930,7317,6491,556,11,7930,46524,64,514,38682,547,3869,294,53149,8023,5019,1744,29449,82653,648,44829,325,2018,8977,3869,34501,1215,27220,479,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,36815,4999,198,29815,389,856,16865,11,358,1053,3041,420,8982,264,5573,315,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,627,198,8586,596,3249,512,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,1375,15436,24291,552,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,264,3363,311,459,10065,705
