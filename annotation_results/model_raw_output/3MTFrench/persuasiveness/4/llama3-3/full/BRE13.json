{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:27:09.564607656Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by:\n\n* Starting with a relatable story that grabs the audience's attention\n* Providing a clear and concise explanation of the research process and results\n* Using analogies and metaphors to make complex concepts more accessible (e.g., \"un petit peu de cuisine\")\n* Showcasing enthusiasm and passion for the subject matter\n* Ending with a thought-provoking question that encourages further exploration\n\nHowever, I would deduct one point because:\n\n* The speech could benefit from a clearer structure and organization, as it jumps between different ideas and anecdotes\n* Some sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them hard to follow\n* There is no direct conclusion or summary at the end of the speech, which might leave some audience members unclear about the main points.\n\nOverall, while there are some minor issues with clarity and organization, the speaker's energy, creativity, and ability to engage the audience make their message persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,29253,7010,29449,11159,26633,50026,77,3808,6033,47053,2957,864,57123,409,348,2259,35597,24560,7591,1677,376,285,13,445,77025,1330,1880,1208,1589,2182,18274,978,276,2428,13,13789,11,4864,36731,6502,25945,8571,294,31769,69,355,8047,11,39587,4864,27389,69,68862,31632,220,508,4520,32592,3625,296,31539,13,34447,87320,3625,10278,300,1880,87320,20028,949,19421,14707,11,3613,81,4558,79507,11,4864,36731,79988,3869,1208,523,13559,10253,35641,625,2439,13,6178,72,11,4864,9189,834,16968,409,16578,11,653,3846,15132,13080,7591,346,20553,285,7591,65,11206,5512,5019,513,20028,6316,51651,40351,2922,57286,309,12558,13,34447,96308,951,35641,625,2439,11,8162,2445,454,8467,30547,3869,653,2249,13,34447,39015,11,4864,100164,11,4864,9189,100164,96586,13,41621,12584,89,757,13510,11,951,35641,625,2439,7010,514,4538,818,409,12155,18274,978,598,13,29749,841,296,6,511,87624,17317,39015,13,19421,14707,2536,11,7216,89,45325,1744,409,13026,4881,14240,29246,11,389,46939,1647,376,978,3869,30179,768,409,35641,625,2439,7010,3625,2848,17675,1759,409,12155,18274,978,598,13,9605,3846,45441,7010,326,93847,11,1765,3625,4039,12249,6033,7010,3625,272,15433,12843,2848,51058,13,4418,66,11,44829,447,35329,379,264,409,1208,17536,8065,89429,355,409,1208,1589,2182,18274,978,276,2428,11,87320,3900,308,59858,665,44521,1339,6502,7836,598,949,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,264,409,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,1880,294,57286,664,1291,1208,21797,13109,951,35641,625,2439,7930,513,52895,46225,39015,1481,300,13,27058,45602,11,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,15132,682,14014,550,360,424,6316,4046,20609,68,1841,349,409,1589,2182,18274,978,276,2428,1317,361,409,220,7007,12,3443,296,75104,13,7695,326,6,546,35881,13649,978,665,89781,6853,1880,15907,89781,37907,757,4958,306,951,44453,31355,13,34447,42676,503,34155,59062,978,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,841,36731,22011,11,10071,87320,39929,1046,12416,294,31109,50852,949,29749,51441,20028,17258,784,261,951,35641,625,2439,7930,36875,13327,1001,308,58736,17194,6502,13,19421,27584,4502,46152,3073,306,11,46152,18434,306,4046,20609,42625,32592,3577,290,15878,41263,20712,1880,15878,21965,39929,3869,296,4091,11,3846,7930,1826,77411,3869,14843,556,3869,1208,3703,67763,13,4418,66,3846,1744,503,34155,20272,11,272,17771,1744,503,34155,59062,978,3869,7363,72684,13,2998,51092,11,503,34155,60217,978,1880,665,5589,11,503,34155,59062,978,3869,20028,951,88817,8696,1765,3625,4787,409,42067,50026,40280,11,22299,1208,26686,40948,978,665,220,952,894,479,6033,1208,2798,14081,1598,13,39783,37291,11083,326,2227,288,272,718,14014,1880,11083,88817,8696,10415,5512,11,503,34155,2536,6502,665,1488,261,6316,97045,11,10071,6316,259,361,409,36105,13,19421,503,34155,59062,978,3869,326,6,677,71,15171,96642,5945,1725,11,83259,409,7829,5019,296,59858,5906,8065,64972,3625,4787,7138,75,645,13,4366,51173,11,503,34155,90096,978,409,1208,1589,2182,274,17771,653,459,2428,1880,51199,924,846,5019,39929,951,5945,1725,14425,31548,342,414,1969,82,13,33150,1620,11,503,34155,5906,8065,1486,220,972,7625,53819,409,7829,94773,9721,519,11,2536,4864,36731,66090,409,45602,74282,66014,514,1421,6672,13,2998,5589,11,503,34155,7591,981,978,11083,4046,331,64801,1765,11083,5906,1880,27833,1880,503,34155,9604,84,13,622,6,57558,84,13,19421,4983,648,7643,342,547,3869,342,25108,9004,11,11083,887,14014,14848,15925,3930,78422,648,13,1252,35641,62799,274,17771,68866,978,13,24703,9880,2922,6496,11,4864,757,36731,17634,84,42463,1744,503,31769,2629,285,514,21134,3869,39929,13399,978,653,35641,62799,409,1208,1589,2182,274,17771,459,2428,13,19421,75804,88253,11,503,41901,16796,13399,978,220,8258,12,22,94773,85114,13,14465,3625,16796,57705,978,6091,978,5019,47929,3869,26077,951,16948,2492,46152,74756,7304,1188,13,19421,503,34155,22011,1744,3738,288,409,27750,35641,625,2439,56311,23761,409,80080,16948,4558,1634,13,43987,26178,1744,503,34155,6316,887,8047,409,326,6,75876,409,326,6,1138,344,582,13109,11,503,34155,42587,978,28130,34501,665,3625,2322,61512,7010,96642,4787,409,2798,14081,1598,11,409,19637,645,3003,978,11,1370,51173,13,2998,25500,11,4864,1239,42441,26077,1514,27389,69,12339,1765,10335,265,1880,22299,39043,11,503,6,4202,2852,6316,887,8047,409,326,6,1138,391,403,685,7010,1208,17536,32592,29691,13,27058,93224,554,11,20662,270,4558,325,757,29557,409,46131,1744,27584,7010,951,4787,11741,5615,9004,11,3900,379,264,1208,30179,768,409,17536,13,19421,39587,5019,41091,11,272,17771,65285,266,3869,48021,1208,3488,46932,5048,13,27058,62998,308,59858,44521,1339,6502,409,1208,17536,7010,326,49455,265,71080,3930,92622,2922,6496,949,1611,1208,17536,7010,326,77025,1330,13,19421,6316,56404,575,685,13,27058,62998,4864,308,59858,9517,79,66522,7010,326,77025,1330,20028,653,46110,28800,409,36105,949,2206,46524,653,35641,62799,5066,2442,12,478,2800,265,1880,259,6,20243,299,75117,1647,4046,998,458,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1
