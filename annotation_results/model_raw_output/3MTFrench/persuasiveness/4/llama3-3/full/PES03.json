Additionally, while the speaker does provide practical solutions, they don't fully address the larger societal and economic changes that would be needed to widely adopt such practices.\n\nOverall, I think the speech is very persuasive, but not quite perfect.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3869,326,6,6581,295,24547,72,1765,326,6,277,1936,277,1395,13,29179,321,6496,3846,1744,7631,1339,7643,6800,1474,12339,3869,27750,86696,60404,13,65381,326,31769,5481,593,11,4864,841,9517,44811,2852,23423,978,1744,503,65948,2852,20028,409,1208,38317,1765,514,24547,72,13,19421,76776,11,4864,308,6,4202,2192,56316,43306,978,1744,1370,20662,95234,11,7643,6800,1474,12339,5899,1339,25692,85815,6316,35881,1169,409,1208,9320,91329,1640,2428,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,14425,285,3625,100246,409,96642,49255,7330,333,8467,5019,969,8678,805,1208,59471,951,24282,2854,33903,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,4571,72,38469,3930,34922,2854,467,20605,265,1744,272,17771,1370,3625,4433,1572,1744,514,34922,51913,582,3159,1208,3682,13109,294,6,10610,80381,3904,11,1208,81098,951,1760,978,1572,11,3625,19637,645,1332,76743,2249,22299,514,2267,1892,12108,6033,514,3273,339,367,13,5034,6800,1474,12339,27549,17317,20605,265,1744,3625,6136,288,513,46798,81,79738,1120,1133,409,27750,46798,6417,812,11,1880,1744,326,6,324,483,1826,653,9250,76185,13,2998,5589,11,3625,7135,80463,20605,8135,2107,2850,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,11,653,951,1665,22589,21901,2908,12249,409,1208,59471,409,326,77025,745,1362,2854,8511,43989,409,14448,12329,3625,4433,1572,5019,30870,566,261,3846,11008,409,10184,6417,812,13,19421,44829,11,8065,220,508,68,97739,9326,11,1208,281,10515,299,331,318,648,1826,69003,978,13,1952,274,17771,5906,3869,43998,10515,12329,951,459,33050,25108,331,318,8467,3869,6800,21430,4057,294,6,67229,55893,554,26495,458,1880,3625,4433,1572,2854,33903,15132,409,46469,304,332,3742,13,4366,1208,27306,668,3869,523,13559,294,93847,1880,514,16968,682,1339,733,60768,11,389,3625,264,17004,978,3869,1208,44229,20712,13,5034,60128,409,326,93847,951,436,33920,31539,1826,409,1055,84,35205,22761,2428,11,45575,389,264,1913,72,1370,19477,52750,951,603,1572,294,31769,79,2060,13,34447,665,18027,519,3625,8065,1773,20243,13649,11,27750,603,1572,841,1370,10176,89810,6502,3869,79196,52424,326,6,526,14687,3869,1167,354,466,409,12155,4433,1572,13,3489,6853,4824,53410,4502,389,14448,1082,1880,326,6,324,483,409,26725,3625,14464,1821,409,326,6,351,6200,316,53301,41958,26584,5019,36214,12329,3930,1529,978,11,389,92215,2558,556,220,914,11990,409,9145,14127,2392,409,6784,1370,9880,1880,5019,61512,11,75804,88253,7010,20662,945,6200,316,53301,11,514,9637,2249,409,92465,425,409,326,6,1394,1295,308,17771,1744,409,220,20,4,45575,934,35329,43989,294,41901,2842,220,1135,4,3900,379,264,653,97739,9326,13,1952,264,68866,978,653,72601,10006,978,12267,1880,7230,28674,7010,514,43014,389,54206,951,81336,15433,1821,72070,5512,1880,389,3625,7591,376,3159,409,326,49455,265,13,27058,27389,4120,3625,94527,4046,447,9100,5911,276,7211,17724,11,3900,2267,664,14687,38831,15170,6316,59471,4319,74775,951,4433,1572,13,12095,9189,47592,653,91399,11,9189,45366,46932,265,514,31025,321,409,7643,6800,1474,12339,1880,36214,12329,15265,2109,354,1435,3869,326,6,324,483,13,34447,7930,11,294,6,40997,17317,27981,306,4538,1529,978,1880,20272,4538,6784,7010,29449,77824,16036,285,8047,39723,326,54386,1179,68,326,6,10610,332,13283,7010,1208,39973,11,3900,2267,664,14687,2942,12329,514,54606,409,27750,10184,6417,812,5553,3625,27833,13,12535,20028,665,95234,949,19421,14707,11,41199,1208,27306,668,3869,19266,36235,294,6,324,483,11,55398,6,2933,13988,15433,978,409,89714,5019,665,20028,653,76185,91329,1640,2428,11,503,34155,81621,665,5891,361,653,6800,13026,409,12823,7930,3073,306,46939,46838,494,2852,653,951,665,3841,2249,21901,2908,12249,1880,294,6,44803,805,1880,409,58673,15610,1765,3625,4787,65207,82653,8467,1880,7829,75,645,7930,29557,376,546,409,30870,566,261,3846,11008,409,1208,1167,51111,13,2998,30179,812,220,605,8261,11,665,220,18,4520,11,503,6,25632,12339,4799,12329,6316,55133,3044,1208,85424,409,42563,1744,20662,9320,91329,1640,2428,513,28068,68,28463,7010,29449,27306,668,13,25145,72,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1473,9,28757,449,264,4443,50750,1295,430,49155,279,10877,596,6666,198,9,81200,12624,6029,311,1862,872,3802,922,279,12939,315,34978,40335,198,9,57094,287,279,13970,2317,323,59529,4442,430,617,20162,311,1057,1510,41421,52221,12659,198,9,67118,15325,10105,323,27548,11,1778,439,1701,63287,430,8821,40335,505,55061,288,11
