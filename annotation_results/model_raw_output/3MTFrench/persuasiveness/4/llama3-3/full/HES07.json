{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T17:58:37.451677173Z","response":"**Scale:** 1-5\n\n**Dimension:** Persuasiveness of the speech\n\n**Task:** Evaluate the transcript and give a score based on the scale.\n\nAfter analyzing the transcript, I would give a score of **4.5** out of 5. The speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by:\n\n* Using a relatable example to illustrate their point\n* Providing specific data and statistics to support their claims\n* Showcasing their expertise in the field through the use of technical terms like \"acceptability\" and \"regulation\"\n* Displaying emotional intelligence by acknowledging the struggles faced by parents and children\n* Using rhetorical devices like repetition (\"rejet\", \"acceptabilité\") to emphasize their message\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is also rigorous, as they:\n\n* Present a clear argument with supporting evidence\n* Use logical connections between ideas (e.g., from describing the struggle of parents to discussing the relevance of their research)\n* Show a deep understanding of the topic and its implications\n\nHowever, I would deduct 0.5 points because some parts of the speech feel a bit too detailed or technical for a general audience. Additionally, the speaker occasionally uses vague phrases like \"un petit coup de pouce récemment\" (a recent little push), which may not be as clear to non-native speakers or those unfamiliar with French culture. Overall, though, the speaker's persuasive abilities are impressive, and their message is well-crafted and convincing.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3489,438,389,4160,275,3869,61285,1880,829,296,12339,274,41901,374,265,20662,6685,11,389,25692,23423,261,11,84295,85,2171,978,11,8811,83664,11,274,27688,6496,11,10071,41091,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,9189,1647,95920,11,272,17771,514,312,15769,934,54386,25692,78551,1765,514,2145,425,409,20662,38920,37254,13,356,17771,1208,85877,22550,409,829,296,12339,7930,274,6,6581,16716,409,25400,20028,41635,261,653,35030,292,2908,7930,1826,653,25500,34527,68,27584,37953,447,80720,514,296,19010,853,3869,816,4202,13,41621,73953,89,934,80720,11412,379,2961,1553,11,3900,514,47090,11,272,17771,16595,5019,326,6,391,275,635,13,61285,326,6,408,1133,11,33013,4558,451,3846,27584,46932,5048,13,12095,40744,3625,550,5014,594,28111,306,3869,39043,11,9189,73953,89,60019,934,80720,82133,84788,404,3869,46932,265,28130,89714,11,3846,7930,1826,83195,5019,27549,11,7010,653,14435,263,8078,294,52374,69,34395,3930,27430,11,3625,16968,3154,519,49733,11,3869,12366,13,19421,4864,36731,3738,1744,26725,3625,6699,30179,812,7010,1208,71632,11,49733,11,3846,57992,11,15132,6225,21041,3869,951,78199,22299,11,1043,81239,4791,72,11,1400,556,11,7294,1481,62114,13,2998,4606,11,77818,43765,11,1208,38682,1001,367,1860,685,13,19421,41199,220,679,19,11,27549,33330,8065,9511,67763,15430,25297,2428,409,550,15170,1744,28130,43453,35030,292,2908,56311,23761,42587,5512,665,64032,8747,2416,593,13,350,2053,1744,27389,46790,1880,15878,5107,978,11,665,653,3937,11,389,1370,273,294,6,10543,87782,13,34447,514,2046,11,272,17771,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,409,5410,294,57286,29246,11,665,5589,65268,13,7695,308,59858,50590,6502,11,44829,593,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,264,24560,294,41901,75831,13,13789,11,4864,9189,326,69537,53218,409,296,41901,7591,788,268,69,685,7930,73953,409,28130,35030,292,2908,11,272,17771,6502,52842,42625,4046,1325,306,13,16062,16081,11,503,34155,7631,978,3869,28130,2748,294,6,87064,484,404,28130,9517,1335,11,514,65285,266,409,1208,85424,11,514,27138,7930,264,24560,100243,11,1880,84871,294,81979,52962,3808,7930,757,29557,73468,3869,99961,8363,1208,4287,87782,13,1252,28800,5636,409,56321,8261,11,9952,6316,51651,19660,294,6,17156,458,409,272,3023,265,11,84364,409,220,868,410,1880,85424,409,35030,292,24469,11,389,25692,23761,4046,26591,978,13,9240,10333,45575,3869,20028,89504,40744,27750,46681,11,3869,3625,60946,265,3869,3625,9517,12023,3869,3625,98054,60538,21041,13,19421,5019,39043,11,503,49963,1082,89,951,75601,2601,20719,8467,294,6,44803,325,48539,11067,7447,1773,18658,8301,13,432,5512,495,266,11,503,34155,18757,72796,26725,3625,35030,292,24469,1765,6316,86806,1880,27584,48454,1880,665,34501,409,28130,2361,11,7930,7591,3825,14707,97717,951,52962,3808,7930,14848,24560,9466,14014,11,503,34155,18757,3625,7591,566,9779,22299,14240,519,4287,5512,6033,2536,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,503,49963,1082,3846,91558,8135,13327,5019,4046,68019,1327,76430,409,80080,75332,2436,13,2895,66096,3869,25400,11,389,829,275,1370,51173,934,6,37907,15132,3625,33209,8467,7930,15132,14707,4287,5512,1370,3625,60404,665,9822,13,19421,5019,66056,7930,841,514,15132,6502,11,389,829,275,934,6,37907,15132,3625,802,9769,9004,7930,29557,2221,1188,8065,9511,67763,934,85217,3625,52895,46225,409,64972,9427,16339,28130,653,296,531,3972,13,1611,5636,665,5636,409,52571,1759,15132,92759,5512,1370,3846,83597,1880,45441,42587,5512,13,5186,12416,326,6,13885,978,16271,11,514,3678,511,1880,326,62595,269,588,73,11,951,46681,82133,23761,6667,5512,665,9392,466,265,11,665,4466,451,1880,8065,123295,13,7695,47090,13510,1744,503,34155,15925,653,46110,16081,409,17258,346,9517,54921,479,11,665,5589,13,1252,17475,978,16081,409,17258,346,13,445,6,39883,62891,11,326,6,58904,62940,20487,409,1208,77323,264,78511,978,653,2246,409,293,6217,9994,72,7930,42182,29557,10367,294,58591,73511,15171,1208,85424,665,6900,409,296,6853,1880,26725,3625,60404,274,17771,312,2792,333,665,1046,19010,14081,519,514,82620,294,6,306,404,1880,21965,348,44688,10737,978,10253,60404,13,19421,7010,3846,2246,11,20662,15244,951,17089,653,285,264,13836,625,978,326,55624,14081,49530,409,296,1339,969,12,6723,2249,13,362,13836,625,978,326,55624,14081,49530,409,3846,91558,8135,13327,11,7930,1370,264,4618,1759,11,1826,665,45369,409,1652,2461,1370,22171,768,95199,26193,3930,35030,292,2908,13,1611,11655,74725,86555,321,11,514,5410,294,57286,799,409,326,6,10543,87782,264,20272,436,395,84,535,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,
