The speech is more of a emotive appeal than a well-reasoned argument.\n\nIn particular:\n\n1. **Lack of clarity**: The speaker jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.\n2. **No clear goals or objectives**: The audience is left wondering what specific changes the speaker wants to bring about or how they plan to achieve them.\n3. **Emphasis on emotions over facts**: While emotional appeals can be powerful, they must be grounded in verifiable data and logical reasoning.\n4. **Repetitive language**: The speaker's repeated use of \"I don't know\" and \"I think\" creates uncertainty and undermines their credibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the speech conveys passion and frustration, its persuasive power is limited due to the lack of a clear, well-structured argument.\n\n**Score:**
