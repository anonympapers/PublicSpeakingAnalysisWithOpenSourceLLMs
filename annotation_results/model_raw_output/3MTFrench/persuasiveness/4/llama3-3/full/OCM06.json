{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:16:04.796300121Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as follows:\n\nDIMENSION: Persuasive power of the speech (1-5)\n* Reasoning: 4\n* Emotional appeal: 3.5\n* Clarity: 4.5\n* Concreteness: 4\n\nOverall, I would give a score of **4.2** on a scale of 1 to 5.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe speaker is quite convincing in their argument about the stereotypes surrounding international students and the need for understanding their experiences. They use a personal anecdote to illustrate their point, which makes it more relatable and engaging. The speaker also uses a clear and logical structure to build their case, starting with a definition of acculturation and then moving on to describe its different phases.\n\nThe emotional appeal is somewhat limited, as the speech is mostly focused on presenting information rather than evoking strong emotions in the audience. However, the speaker does use a personal touch by sharing their own experience, which helps to create a connection with the listeners.\n\nIn terms of clarity and concreteness, I would say that the speaker does an excellent job of explaining complex concepts like acculturation and cultural shock in simple language. They also provide specific examples and data to support their points, making it easier for the audience to understand and follow along.\n\nOverall, while the speech is not particularly flashy or dramatic, it is well-structured, well-reasoned, and effectively conveys the speaker's message.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3489,438,4864,62163,10253,48577,409,1647,1218,61140,11,4068,27549,513,71925,6960,653,14240,41939,6625,11,503,6,677,83,1188,44093,1208,27584,90509,13,356,17771,653,36963,3703,283,409,324,13,393,1494,758,2998,20272,62197,11,653,14240,41939,28800,2793,72,7010,15907,14240,29246,13,9605,409,357,56771,2442,57375,9189,841,26483,19610,6502,949,622,41901,63762,79071,14896,13,14465,66517,1647,10896,266,7010,514,60697,294,31109,83170,53301,9465,1208,9822,1880,514,7008,13,24703,7930,20272,409,41091,11,6316,14240,50763,2655,38135,13,64105,64,296,26248,14175,285,409,59157,12329,1744,2761,65220,27750,5448,1880,409,326,6,613,1430,265,8065,3666,978,11,389,6033,2067,648,1370,86633,3869,326,6,15433,978,59728,519,409,15907,14240,21178,1821,13,445,57286,50763,2655,38135,11,39043,264,33670,16968,26077,447,22827,7930,42182,274,6,20311,1880,274,6,1662,5100,653,50026,40280,934,35329,1028,9517,75,1149,1656,84,13,46706,1208,38317,11,42067,74234,1133,1880,42067,34185,15132,3869,28800,3625,13988,12416,1765,294,69537,495,2060,13,19421,272,17771,1120,1133,514,34501,40280,409,3846,32118,4919,44618,7930,296,55624,978,22550,7010,514,60697,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,2998,89175,11,514,1920,355,294,69537,495,2060,1826,91678,978,32592,1208,57128,294,31109,83170,665,2033,8437,13,42215,7937,306,272,6009,35530,12742,288,13,33150,65385,11,389,264,653,14240,50763,7930,1826,2262,409,31632,3869,326,31769,376,4091,13,393,9425,11,39043,513,342,69628,13,19421,9964,834,3869,326,31769,376,4091,11,272,17771,5636,4684,76366,934,35329,308,59858,1370,1339,11,76776,42676,272,17771,7010,6316,47838,96282,13,46408,264,379,59062,978,3869,75802,74206,11,13399,8047,14796,8047,11,7591,18375,8047,13,356,17771,1208,10474,3930,523,511,7829,75,13,22989,424,59394,3930,74611,409,1208,293,37093,11,379,11412,84788,404,3869,274,6,20311,55398,81991,4538,54606,7010,4538,21935,294,6,4775,483,11,6033,6502,259,6,266,2221,11,513,95959,523,511,7829,75,11,66021,934,35329,513,3288,653,13550,285,1370,15907,463,8696,13,432,43765,11,42138,653,46110,7010,1208,34185,11,259,35657,3567,14687,5790,95920,7010,326,6,541,265,13,13789,11,5906,3869,961,514,20272,934,54386,264,326,98279,4099,409,513,38831,15170,7010,951,20605,3326,288,4433,4881,3869,16795,11,326,6,1737,112916,12366,11,42676,11,5363,306,20662,88609,11,389,44521,1339,8541,685,3869,23423,261,1744,326,6,4683,65679,409,326,57286,664,290,1826,96308,20940,333,11,2536,30,19421,3900,264,78705,55755,24560,9952,426,7379,11206,1880,409,523,511,7829,75,13,16770,11,97507,13,8560,75876,43765,11,20662,91678,367,14135,64829,1826,71151,77071,4688,13,423,22827,14240,664,3675,3869,326,49455,265,11,1208,88609,35456,3869,6316,22636,6960,5636,6033,40970,51199,68,13,507,2005,11,39043,25692,23761,653,2033,52274,13,69327,653,6033,648,11,6033,648,11,1880,7010,3846,62891,4865,11,389,1826,3663,3869,951,14240,21178,1821,7930,308,6,546,6502,84788,72,3869,513,1647,466,326,31769,33210,3930,523,511,7829,75,13,393,556,11,46152,14848,27584,8541,685,3869,91329,371,261,28130,19266,30362,3869,326,31769,376,4091,13,356,17771,39015,1744,7643,270,4558,325,1826,40970,31957,5048,13,48109,10045,2439,951,10105,5019,51913,2058,1744,45602,308,6,1138,535,13,27058,296,804,3869,14707,20662,9131,11,4864,36731,3625,84411,281,20243,3422,14240,664,53819,2655,367,12249,1880,4864,38831,13559,665,46874,978,924,288,294,69537,495,2060,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,6316,48901,409,9406,3963,273,13,14465,841,63762,56316,26077,70477,346,4864,91507,14707,68226,45712,261,3930,11347,13,65381,31632,409,3846,1920,355,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,653,2144,12844,51625,285,665,14240,41939,4068,3625,34561,2784,5512,294,26248,1188,409,432,3251,258,11,10383,513,1920,355,13,9648,55755,22011,4068,3625,4046,19926,1744,3625,14240,21178,1821,259,47789,1188,9952,4538,1218,61140,11,10383,20662,17140,294,69537,9769,21152,949,356,14140,13,328,55624,978,676,978,71686,3869,326,52152,41116,951,34561,2784,5512,11,272,17771,92759,519,653,33013,42625,3930,1920,355,10253,453,318,5919,13,386,23034,3869,51309,11,272,17771,1744,514,65385,409,1647,264,46043,13,19421,22299,1208,81098,11,3846,308,17771,5636,13836,625,8047,11,3869,45640,409,83259,4068,513,44093,1370,653,21134,961,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,11263,512,198,76219,24557,25,21097,84,27645,2410,315,279,8982,320,16,12,20,8,198,9,27857,287,25,220,19,198,9,95
