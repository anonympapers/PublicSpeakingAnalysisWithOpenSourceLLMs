{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:00:50.759794148Z","response":"Based on the provided transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by:\n\n1. Starting with an engaging story that grabs the audience's attention and establishes a connection.\n2. Using relatable analogies (e.g., comparing the process to climbing a 20-story building) to explain complex scientific concepts.\n3. Highlighting the significance of the research and its potential impact on society, making it relevant and interesting to the audience.\n4. Showing enthusiasm and passion for the topic, which is infectious and helps build trust with the listeners.\n\nThe only aspect that might detract from the overall persuasiveness is the occasional use of colloquial expressions and informal language (e.g., \"mon arbusse,\" \"ma princesse\"), which may not be suitable for all audiences. However, in this case, it seems to have been intended to add a touch of humor and approachability.\n\nOverall, I believe the speaker effectively crafts a convincing message that is likely to resonate with their audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,13510,79071,14896,1744,9189,308,6,57558,10333,6502,71151,11,7643,270,4558,325,1826,28093,668,409,20272,13,7695,43989,6316,37291,653,802,10551,325,11,45889,11,10071,2558,285,519,6316,22337,978,3395,974,2307,79,22460,556,13,46408,57110,22550,3625,48488,3625,88704,288,5019,26633,6503,2439,13,12029,67882,11,27549,1826,25945,4642,1765,6316,35030,648,62622,481,75804,88253,11,514,9572,3930,272,5976,2933,13,2009,29032,677,4354,638,11,272,17771,653,7970,9859,5019,653,32118,11943,13,1611,2249,72,111908,1133,11,27549,13458,6316,48659,272,1260,1880,25692,4958,404,294,6,412,8839,5019,35881,3655,261,951,32118,4919,2191,288,35597,1880,3327,72684,3930,9572,13,34447,20028,27750,14240,29246,63846,275,306,6316,25626,10484,13109,409,22337,20243,2482,13,19421,28130,719,308,41901,54206,1744,25945,28800,13,65381,15265,55847,11,3698,3675,47090,57375,409,82711,31355,5019,64290,404,653,23882,2727,409,1208,22337,20243,1130,30,39783,8941,818,11,9189,13085,89,3869,62827,409,1208,2967,635,5019,1208,9517,66,51111,30,1708,1105,11,951,38094,75460,14848,55162,10036,3869,274,55624,295,12329,13,356,17771,3284,11,10071,63846,275,306,220,508,14240,9521,11,272,17771,4046,20609,68,13,2998,20272,11,7643,22337,20243,1130,1826,6316,1380,24201,8065,2307,79,22460,556,11,10071,62097,102843,665,62321,294,31109,7364,409,220,508,14240,1154,11,3900,47090,48908,1208,7591,34667,38149,5019,934,6,37907,33254,688,514,38900,11,8065,40970,1709,978,6091,325,514,9572,13,6178,72,11,4864,3355,729,409,1208,3091,838,20712,7930,11412,3869,513,8977,13,507,2005,11,272,17771,653,42463,77580,13,34447,4864,308,34155,6502,21965,6316,20605,8047,409,220,508,14240,1154,13,921,20234,14240,425,1826,6316,14240,2070,409,43998,4558,325,13,356,17771,6316,4046,11044,296,618,978,89,3023,265,5019,20028,6316,17466,38094,2428,1765,1208,22337,20243,1130,11,1880,409,25646,665,25646,3869,2961,1553,3869,1208,22337,20243,1130,7930,296,55624,978,22550,13,27058,46777,33013,547,11,503,34155,1296,978,951,43386,33903,409,4787,3869,1208,293,6347,4791,556,11,2798,14081,1598,11,69996,11,9517,533,333,11,1880,220,24,37291,1765,220,605,11,39043,841,15572,68,6502,13,1708,1105,11,220,508,14240,9521,11,272,96287,48488,21965,1317,13,34447,389,113147,665,3930,42463,1744,326,6,723,10743,2558,285,1339,29449,22337,20243,1130,11,15878,2307,68226,11,10071,594,28111,519,48488,3869,1208,22337,20243,1130,4642,13,19421,73103,2922,6496,11,3900,264,54206,665,25945,25626,10484,13109,13,1708,1105,11,8065,45369,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,11741,1339,665,25626,10484,13109,20662,22337,20243,1130,11,1880,503,34155,23008,75117,14843,275,3625,14240,9521,893,447,15844,5019,64290,404,1208,22337,20243,1130,4642,13,435,2259,1001,11,503,34155,1647,376,978,1744,272,96287,3284,13,19421,665,71686,220,19,14240,9521,11,8065,39381,409,220,508,13,2998,20272,11,1647,802,10551,325,11,7643,1647,376,8047,653,21765,6367,13,34447,29557,61512,294,6,1138,1553,934,300,3904,8065,6987,414,11,3900,757,66167,5636,1744,220,19,14240,1154,3869,1647,466,8065,39381,409,220,508,13,1708,1105,11,74699,1744,4864,7591,85,41098,7643,84293,325,11,4864,91507,20028,951,1491,7607,38094,8467,1765,1208,22337,20243,1130,5019,1208,98054,15430,25297,81235,5636,4642,11,409,1208,15430,16833,17515,2987,11,25400,71751,6316,94721,50510,8047,665,1794,2727,13,19421,76776,11,74699,934,80720,1826,17634,361,51794,294,69537,12416,3869,29449,44397,19395,648,11,27549,11412,665,5589,68226,23761,42587,978,22299,281,17194,76680,4714,10515,648,45973,514,9572,3930,272,5976,2933,13,27058,1913,404,11,4864,91507,312,65522,1291,1647,802,10551,325,13,3489,301,39879,11,10071,7930,264,20272,934,300,3904,16968,514,42775,13,19421,20605,265,326,6,2910,3433,481,9257,24201,1469,90332,1370,56594,1986,13109,13,362,17317,514,57683,406,665,1208,1760,978,713,519,11,54401,1744,17317,18434,919,77818,2249,1880,3900,379,665,48488,294,41901,69,1821,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,3984,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,512,198,16,13,28757,449,459,23387,3446,430,49155,279,10877,596,6666,323,64664,264,3717,13,198,17,13,12362,1375,15436,24291,552,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,279,1920,311,30608,264,220,508,46199,4857,8,311,10552,6485,12624,19476,13,198,18,13,57094,287,279,26431,315,279,3495,323,1202,4754,5536,389,8396,11,3339,433,9959,323,7185,311,279,10877,13
