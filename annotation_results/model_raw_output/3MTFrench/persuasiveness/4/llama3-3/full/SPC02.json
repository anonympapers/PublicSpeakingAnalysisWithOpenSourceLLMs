Nevertheless, the speaker effectively crafts a convincing message that resonates with the audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,1744,326,54386,864,77,818,514,6155,57332,409,15265,6141,3357,324,13,42062,65,7379,1395,9189,11412,2142,409,9467,3095,11,934,54386,69152,26317,46681,9120,936,3946,13,356,8458,9189,5353,653,25500,80259,13,7695,1826,5636,25165,409,29449,27138,11,1880,7930,17317,3613,68495,26725,945,275,22299,45602,13,356,17771,8811,329,648,11,272,17771,514,9572,13,11876,2849,2482,9572,4881,82133,30711,977,653,1262,2194,13,24703,7447,501,72,978,1280,978,5589,3904,55398,81991,6233,352,5512,11,76076,2942,288,1880,1370,69,309,4558,4978,16968,514,34922,2854,467,13,27058,23589,265,11,84568,82133,513,1760,978,1414,3846,78680,1013,13,19421,3930,16081,11,951,28068,1441,26725,3625,42345,66474,409,47371,1137,409,15265,2942,44618,13,4702,68,934,6,60917,12416,21430,11,1208,86806,6425,5019,4046,13584,648,934,80720,63409,12339,1880,294,49963,12329,951,6916,288,409,19814,11191,11,22299,1208,38094,11345,978,4714,648,6033,1208,9063,12,466,4714,648,13,10377,1082,89,20662,89714,11,272,17771,22299,2605,78,48358,1824,13649,554,409,2126,519,13,356,14140,11,514,1046,52908,665,841,25692,5636,19266,46957,11,10071,9189,308,6,52659,5636,294,31769,47262,13109,13,19421,514,281,556,274,17771,89714,409,46777,841,15132,6502,44093,31914,2492,13,41621,1391,48009,89,39587,934,35329,1826,34771,409,46524,409,87325,9781,1224,812,5019,4046,13584,648,934,80720,63409,12339,13,19421,4502,17317,864,77,919,514,80259,3869,326,41901,3078,13,19421,4502,17317,17317,17576,919,1765,29449,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,96308,1744,1765,514,9572,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1765,12155,47371,4377,11,96308,1744,1765,514,1046,52908,13,19421,4502,1208,6425,43989,409,57532,29449,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,22299,514,21901,3625,14027,1354,11,272,17771,4538,3488,1744,4864,72567,2852,36670,265,11,39043,274,53149,6853,326,6,12828,359,354,618,391,648,13,2998,20272,11,514,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,272,17771,1208,4379,3930,34922,2854,467,13,46706,20662,4379,11,3900,379,264,3625,3290,1821,11,3625,945,408,1439,68061,625,3808,1880,3625,1499,3457,31539,11,10071,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,13,11876,1499,3457,388,513,15132,3625,326,6,13885,2168,418,5512,13,7695,665,29253,409,51854,5089,5512,1880,15132,54021,5208,91640,87158,514,9572,56445,3869,513,52895,716,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,1744,514,9572,11,514,1046,52908,11,272,17771,78680,1037,13,4418,66,12266,5019,841,6502,1208,74333,3625,326,6,13885,2168,418,5512,409,514,21277,12329,13,11583,3488,11,272,17771,409,47929,4502,3900,379,44521,1339,42676,27584,6502,653,91116,5019,1744,1208,4379,17782,3869,20028,6316,824,17647,46206,514,1046,52908,13,27058,6348,261,1486,409,523,1604,85,541,404,11,2167,1133,1765,514,25911,3846,7930,513,1522,1339,11,503,34155,52579,653,6685,9952,1647,73757,951,4020,1725,409,15756,2530,1880,503,34155,14240,21178,978,3625,22639,9465,3625,2849,2482,9572,4881,1880,3625,326,6,13885,2168,418,5512,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,503,34155,59148,1653,934,35329,379,50590,26633,8415,19395,2490,409,326,6,13885,2168,25123,13,24703,7930,66167,14545,447,8047,3869,326,6,24677,8047,1826,3846,7930,17782,3869,5790,95920,46206,514,1046,52908,5019,21277,12329,13,622,34155,1647,376,978,1744,20662,26633,90272,8415,97193,264,917,23992,978,3869,6316,5089,8047,409,7591,69178,76305,285,8047,7010,326,6,82182,1037,13,1952,3625,917,6853,1880,326,6,13885,2168,418,978,31807,1748,32118,97495,13,27058,62998,326,6,82182,1037,949,4366,346,934,85217,15132,94616,5512,409,98385,1760,978,1572,11,409,86696,75119,288,11,1744,326,54386,917,6853,57110,911,483,13,19421,503,34155,5906,665,4046,28580,1744,272,96287,77433,3869,27750,57110,911,1572,7930,513,69003,306,3869,274,6,351,462,716,8065,70002,9572,974,5019,6316,37398,7591,376,52750,13,62463,44827,2922,6496,11,503,34155,1167,27,91,339,91,29,72,5019,514,9572,3930,628,316,11,10071,84568,15132,34923,285,5019,294,81979,51423,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,3625,326,6,13885,2168,418,5512,31807,1748,32118,97495,15132,44093,21965,28800,81786,1765,514,25911,13,356,17771,5019,39043,1744,75804,88253,17317,52895,375,653,43453,89714,6316,33119,1605,391,648,5019,3625,2558,556,665,6800,13026,13,24703,35737,1558,582,346,467,11,6502,550,5615,688,333,11,10071,7317,391,332,2428,5019,3625,8811,3536,29121,1133,13,24703,11412,934,35329,274,41901,3117,451,16968,3625,1499,3457,388,3869,326,6,82182,1037,13,19421,45575,11,1913,275,3625,16081,1439,409,2126,519,11,1913,275,3625,1046,361,1439,1880,665,5589,5553,3625,5769,22626,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,3
