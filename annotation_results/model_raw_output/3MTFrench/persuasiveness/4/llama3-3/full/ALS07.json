{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:17:37.029883424Z","response":"Based on the transcript provided, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by:\n\n1. Using rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"Le temps c'est à quel se mangue du passé\") to emphasize their point.\n2. Providing examples and analogies (e.g., \"Imaginez-nous l'inflore, c'est pas nous hier\") to help illustrate their ideas.\n3. Showing a clear understanding of the topic by referencing philosophical concepts and scientific theories.\n4. Using persuasive language to encourage the audience to think critically about the role of time in human existence.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 1 point because some parts of the speech may be perceived as overly philosophical or abstract, which could potentially alienate some listeners. Additionally, the speaker's argumentation is not always rigorous and could benefit from more concrete examples and supporting evidence.\n\nOverall, I believe the speaker presents a compelling case that effectively engages the audience and encourages them to think critically about the topic of time.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,356,17771,60019,52313,278,11,10071,4160,321,6496,11,951,77124,409,9189,11,5019,9189,3327,72684,3846,934,80720,514,27138,11,16968,3869,326,57286,408,1133,11,27584,37953,409,20662,506,20672,11,1765,326,98279,4099,3930,27138,13,356,17771,653,48924,901,11,2536,30,14465,757,14175,1441,3869,326,6,75876,409,9189,15473,444,466,20662,87810,3930,27138,294,6,434,306,8065,65385,11,14707,42844,56321,4520,11,16968,514,8631,3930,27076,316,99746,13,100178,653,7643,274,12339,11,73953,89,1765,11083,15471,417,951,1052,2641,11,503,34155,864,77,1339,1317,67380,5019,514,60946,265,55398,81991,3846,934,41901,9880,11,503,34155,296,26248,7591,21200,978,409,917,9484,265,514,27138,409,25400,98375,11,22299,8065,8199,409,9517,12287,290,13,19421,1208,3488,7930,50590,9840,978,1647,60020,43989,1208,46932,5048,11,87320,18434,2439,5392,788,1765,1208,3577,290,3930,27138,11,4068,514,27138,17317,7591,23827,306,12,8839,11,10071,514,27138,25400,98375,1826,30547,11,326,26248,99481,9517,301,43989,1208,1925,409,1913,648,11,7591,9696,978,1841,4502,514,1913,648,11,4864,1370,273,11,45575,16006,1339,409,514,63762,404,11,503,34155,665,296,1105,978,7643,38317,1370,653,7738,11,21134,73953,324,11,3869,21901,519,653,76680,30303,64441,3930,27138,13,11876,79165,7010,1208,7138,11,272,17771,296,525,1880,2349,11,1880,514,27138,409,513,75831,409,3846,54409,7986,1880,409,27750,2609,3808,13,38891,89,5392,788,326,6,13885,20763,11,272,17771,6502,17317,12694,11,39043,4864,308,39982,5512,635,3869,48021,514,27138,7930,5844,18926,818,15878,14425,24918,13,5034,13259,324,296,26248,554,11,514,27138,7010,28130,4046,339,12416,11,1208,84921,409,27750,2609,3808,665,94499,333,11,9465,15878,28591,1880,4538,24560,49806,13,2998,7643,463,331,8511,15627,380,1295,11,503,34155,18757,60946,265,1744,17317,17258,85,2439,514,63762,404,514,27138,3869,30517,514,54409,7986,6033,514,2609,1133,11,1880,514,7591,9696,978,13,34447,272,17771,653,7930,308,6,1138,37093,5019,841,6502,665,7643,3488,11,3846,1744,514,27138,1370,39474,3869,326,6,87713,11,294,94572,15273,514,27138,7930,1826,514,27138,5019,68226,11,4864,11427,2852,1744,87534,409,480,14081,402,616,324,1826,54312,2442,57375,9952,25400,11,653,2840,50753,2307,949,2009,27138,1826,5636,908,978,8065,54409,7986,11,10071,653,12069,6033,2428,1826,514,54206,11,3869,326,6,87713,7930,29253,11,514,27138,308,17771,6502,19266,1768,978,294,6,301,87713,22299,653,3610,7591,5589,648,11,326,6,87713,1826,514,27138,11,3900,1826,4538,27138,3869,25400,7930,1826,1913,648,11,1880,8065,1317,409,829,39973,11,326,6,87713,54606,818,5553,25400,98375,5019,513,60946,265,11,653,19266,782,15769,519,5553,4538,264,43406,1880,3900,5891,1188,3869,4538,81621,1880,1208,2694,68,13,2009,27138,272,17771,3869,26077,513,51296,361,3930,81621,11,326,6,87713,93569,3869,326,6,434,306,57485,5019,514,18434,265,11,326,6,87713,665,18434,519,7010,6316,28591,3154,519,13,34447,4502,326,6,87713,1826,4538,27138,11,4502,326,6,87713,93569,665,514,829,332,519,11,45575,514,27138,308,17771,28463,6316,3488,79036,13,1252,841,46494,519,5553,326,6,5389,404,5019,1028,1759,294,77025,5481,404,11,4864,77438,635,27389,43406,8065,81621,5019,3488,1215,514,57485,13,3341,1208,8198,11,1208,64441,11,1208,32118,8332,483,11,1208,13868,648,11,4538,41675,3869,326,6,1354,29579,409,39143,1215,3625,23878,35933,294,6,301,87713,5019,934,85217,779,556,406,9952,25400,98375,1880,9952,3625,46106,13,5034,8198,1826,308,8047,11,653,48234,294,6,301,22706,21733,11,10071,17317,18434,2439,409,20662,77818,39723,326,6,87713,76605,6155,9769,1565,514,27138,11,22299,4502,389,348,11206,1339,1370,3846,20934,1169,11,6155,9769,1565,326,6,87713,13,19421,4160,3457,7643,3488,409,37398,11,934,80720,6225,15890,12155,12155,75804,88253,3869,1208,38317,7330,52760,11,42676,326,6,1735,333,1826,326,69537,29982,2214,3930,35019,339,2727,409,1208,5788,5019,514,11626,17274,1880,2536,5019,514,893,13109,13,3341,272,17771,44351,934,54386,513,113147,3930,27138,5019,1645,2906,326,6,87713,13,34447,42067,40351,51625,285,1826,4632,2428,1744,17317,74533,1880,43905,29449,22848,978,409,29449,18434,265,1880,17317,3567,2439,514,48021,8065,2532,3930,14707,294,6,301,87713,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,3984,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,512,198,16,13,12362,87068,7766,1778,439,54515,3573,2356,27138,272,17771,3869,26077,513,51296
