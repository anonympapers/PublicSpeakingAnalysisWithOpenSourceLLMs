{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:23:30.116841Z","response":"**Dimension:** Persuasiveness of the speech\n\n**Scale:** From 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much)\n\n**Score:** 4\n\nThe speaker presents a clear and concise argument, using a mix of technical details and relatable examples to make their point. They effectively use storytelling techniques to illustrate the importance of their invention and its potential impact on people's lives. The speech is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The speaker also uses rhetorical devices, such as metaphors (e.g., \"petite piqueur de rappel\") and vivid descriptions (\"c'est dommage\"), which add flavor and interest to the speech.\n\nHowever, while the speaker is generally persuasive, there are some areas where they could improve. For instance, the speech could benefit from more concrete data or statistics to support their claims about the prevalence of dengue fever and the effectiveness of their invention. Additionally, some listeners might find certain parts of the speech (e.g., the mention of a \"micro\" being smaller than the diameter of a hair) to be overly technical or confusing.\n\nOverall, I would give this speech a score of 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasiveness, as it effectively conveys the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for their invention while also using engaging storytelling techniques.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,220,1041,11990,409,9043,70,360,220,20,11,220,15,11,1744,1879,57609,27750,13026,13,220,1041,11990,272,17771,514,13026,409,4865,9400,8467,409,67542,361,1370,459,11,1208,67542,361,1826,6316,19405,9043,1604,1380,74306,1370,1208,89669,13,220,17,11,20,272,17771,514,5019,16525,409,48577,7930,665,21273,4558,451,46777,76132,13,469,36816,272,17771,308,28154,268,10071,272,17771,514,84064,265,514,5636,3062,13,69327,3930,40970,514,5636,682,2227,519,1841,272,17771,514,13026,409,9781,1224,812,31914,2492,1880,409,14027,1354,70720,1760,978,466,20662,8811,329,648,4046,10629,17060,2428,13,62408,8811,329,648,513,17425,1339,25945,83457,13,1183,12416,463,1557,409,1208,35030,34925,19700,27549,513,17425,1339,76776,7010,3625,21935,28800,68866,5512,13,5034,6033,3625,49276,47194,35030,3074,645,893,593,409,17274,1880,409,86374,22811,13,7695,47090,39587,945,404,100198,13,27058,45602,3900,29253,951,10105,13,12029,67882,1370,1208,27389,7611,951,8811,17491,9952,951,52138,729,69406,11,19227,1744,3625,27080,76195,1880,26633,72,111908,1133,1370,326,55624,47698,35030,292,1604,7010,3625,6954,4918,5415,409,1208,8811,329,648,13,34447,45575,11,4068,17258,85,2439,5392,788,7591,5589,404,3869,26077,2863,513,26483,85,2439,3625,8811,17491,33670,294,55624,651,268,404,30,27058,45602,3900,47090,7591,23827,261,1208,348,1149,8047,409,1208,8811,329,648,13,1219,2727,1370,51173,11,665,84921,409,98054,1208,20545,665,88143,541,409,1208,67542,361,7010,514,29340,1880,45602,5019,409,25945,2267,1260,20545,13,1708,1105,97507,11,4864,91507,5636,75144,951,12823,409,1486,288,13,356,17771,514,1744,326,54386,38831,83384,7010,3625,9511,4428,3946,6033,7010,76076,305,9769,79,6388,2249,13,34447,27750,12823,15132,5954,77,404,4881,11,5043,343,1157,1880,665,5636,3869,514,6016,1291,3930,17274,6183,484,13109,11,45602,841,17317,5804,1188,6502,7010,29449,4865,13,2998,5891,29097,3846,7930,87264,60019,92759,519,11,3846,87264,294,49963,12329,951,704,8839,409,7591,40241,23665,11,15878,5636,294,100017,11,28800,23008,1880,25945,38761,13,11876,704,8839,1744,4864,5019,41098,1097,804,1765,514,25911,11,8065,3091,588,4618,3930,8893,13,19421,45602,9952,71686,6316,342,412,668,409,29340,11,653,28800,272,17771,1744,514,342,416,316,99746,5019,514,1891,370,99188,13,3206,46494,1826,409,20245,35573,27750,704,8839,13,1883,301,978,6160,511,391,668,324,98151,299,331,318,2428,11,3900,274,41901,40321,1339,409,26633,9875,11,653,88143,24041,2727,13,6515,299,331,8047,1765,6316,98151,299,451,13,356,17771,326,57286,2070,1208,5636,36897,1880,6502,951,5636,69406,13,3341,15878,27549,11,4864,841,94297,6502,85877,440,261,71269,333,81235,326,6,44803,668,294,55624,14081,49530,13,358,5979,11,326,6,8322,541,409,1208,67542,361,13,2998,51092,11,326,31769,772,299,451,757,29557,409,43678,1208,88605,9465,326,6,519,343,48099,1880,326,6,8322,541,13,1952,264,1879,266,326,31769,772,34395,1744,4864,5019,41098,51794,479,3167,1291,13,43987,26178,11,5019,75144,1647,704,321,1765,514,25911,11,503,34155,63669,409,13726,2693,12329,1647,98151,299,451,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,951,98151,299,451,11,20639,324,978,3869,326,31769,331,6853,3930,8162,13,88083,281,2428,324,409,61158,301,11,653,8162,11,272,17771,15878,37291,5636,46110,1744,3625,13047,99746,409,1647,3091,588,4618,13,350,6,300,51794,11,864,52985,653,51173,13,41621,9189,9622,46138,13,362,11083,27138,1744,9189,9189,779,9188,89,20272,281,72684,1370,653,11679,2428,3869,5336,434,13,1252,11679,2428,2700,12844,409,1208,67542,361,13,507,2005,11,272,17771,4824,53410,13,41621,14240,74466,8065,60014,100063,842,69596,11,8065,60014,100063,4545,13,34447,4502,9189,7591,2972,89,6316,342,412,668,409,37392,409,1647,2107,668,324,11,3625,88143,2311,409,1208,67542,361,82133,513,3722,882,13,4702,68,934,6,2933,1167,546,343,48099,1880,5155,261,13,19421,41091,11,1765,1647,4046,302,12844,11,503,6,49133,514,4068,367,409,8450,98151,34395,13,34447,3846,7930,1826,514,5636,92759,519,7010,16968,39043,11,272,17771,1744,77433,3869,326,55624,729,13109,3930,8450,11,4864,91507,68226,9189,13510,1744,272,17771,1208,20545,1826,5636,6033,40970,4046,3532,978,13,19421,39587,11,272,17771,77680,90859,514,357,1037,409,1208,8811,329,648,13,435,13559,3869,42067,50510,285,951,5906,409,67542,361,13,445,31769,38423,12602,326,31769,302,299,331,318,2428,92215,23761,1208,6425,13,19421,7010,653,18111,324,463,1557,11,503,6,2706,81356,68226,9189,13510,1744,272,17771,12602,13,19421,259,77025,39015,8065,60014,100063,842,69596,11,8065,7970,4545,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728
