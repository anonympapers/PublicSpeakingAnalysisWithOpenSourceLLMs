The text lacks structure, coherence, and logical connections between ideas. Additionally, the language used is often ambiguous, making it difficult to understand what the speaker is trying to convey.\n\nWhile the speaker does try to present some arguments in favor of using natural and renewable materials, these points are not effectively developed or supported by evidence. Furthermore, the text includes several unclear or confusing passages that detract from the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nOverall, while the speaker may have good intentions, their message is not well-crafted or convincingly presented, which reduces the persuasive power of the speech.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,818,86323,11,4864,9189,326,34155,72006,15473,444,466,326,6,90446,951,326,1263,288,409,11083,87892,13,6178,72,11,3900,379,264,924,97717,1744,9189,326,31769,444,55506,20662,25595,346,13,7695,274,53149,6853,19234,1291,29179,953,13,33150,65385,951,11427,552,11,389,25692,3625,46524,96308,3869,1208,7138,13,9648,55755,22011,3900,264,3116,43711,13,34447,7970,11,9952,3625,27138,11,3900,274,17771,951,5320,8839,326,6,454,11,389,3625,88609,1880,389,3625,71451,961,412,13,4366,51173,11,42676,389,8175,265,7010,15907,4160,1224,812,11,389,25692,3625,46524,1765,3625,2092,82,13,41621,274,6,306,73602,11,272,17771,1647,52827,7930,1370,273,13,51344,72,11,389,25692,3625,46524,3869,1208,47276,11,42676,389,1239,42441,1765,3625,757,1759,6033,27584,7010,3625,649,391,2852,6033,665,20272,1208,4502,18223,13,3206,52827,11,3900,97487,39929,6316,1732,43078,13109,4382,11,10071,7970,11,1370,45973,11,3900,1826,653,20272,25945,436,12333,13,7695,274,6,74972,951,86374,4298,2249,11,7447,11733,81239,11,31605,5512,1370,951,33013,98942,85114,11,22299,1208,2849,1130,817,11,9952,1208,88265,389,20272,3625,281,2113,388,1880,3625,7558,2439,13,11876,5906,2849,2482,1353,288,11,7930,1826,326,98146,4047,425,409,1208,2849,1130,817,11,1880,1208,27912,11,7930,1826,1208,14480,7930,259,1188,16968,514,274,6,29982,479,40126,13,3206,52827,11,19234,1291,29179,953,11,264,653,46110,46110,80259,13,7695,264,653,281,2070,324,3930,82711,11,76776,42676,3900,1826,951,379,774,417,665,57128,11,272,17771,3869,13510,653,1376,288,1370,51173,409,757,901,13,7695,264,653,281,2070,324,3930,82711,1880,3900,296,26248,7631,978,4502,503,34155,17258,52274,25400,91878,3869,15907,1760,19395,5512,1880,14707,97717,503,34155,22011,97507,13,622,34155,88817,75117,51854,10105,13,19421,1913,54960,11,503,34155,100162,6316,887,8047,54829,13,19421,4502,389,1826,9511,978,11,3900,841,66167,1879,288,5019,1208,21466,79623,13,356,17771,653,9517,66,483,274,6,77196,5118,2473,22299,3242,287,554,5019,20028,6316,4020,1557,1913,1765,1208,7479,409,82291,11,54401,1744,326,93847,513,3930,3729,9952,514,82711,11,27549,274,17771,83977,332,1880,22299,39043,11,389,281,2070,1760,19395,8047,13,11876,4160,953,1880,259,26248,1892,72,4046,588,484,978,3869,23761,665,1375,79351,2249,13,62408,4020,1557,11,272,17771,934,80720,665,917,6853,11,9517,29651,79507,11,653,16968,19234,519,13,622,34155,33614,1370,45973,934,80720,1826,9517,29651,79507,7930,29253,3869,16968,2449,294,6,14283,15572,261,11,389,951,40321,1821,38094,8467,25945,11,25945,41569,8467,1880,7930,15132,665,5636,2536,5201,283,5512,294,80720,653,50026,40280,13,356,17771,44351,1744,503,34155,7591,21200,978,294,49963,12329,1880,294,31769,2453,91312,27750,40321,1821,1370,294,81979,7930,15132,7138,4835,1880,5790,283,899,4893,13,1219,2727,39043,11,4864,33614,934,54386,7251,648,10253,15671,1880,951,31605,1821,951,1647,10830,22299,326,83508,6729,934,54386,264,44314,978,33670,11,7930,1826,665,20272,77554,14081,8047,4068,7591,9211,294,6,6750,288,294,52374,592,7379,26365,978,2629,285,13,27058,37067,11,85114,11,12108,1474,283,273,11,294,6,1334,9517,66,483,7930,1760,73899,514,4160,953,1880,5293,261,44351,409,326,48968,45317,648,4319,74775,11,272,17771,3869,13510,39723,259,77025,326,1056,978,11,294,6,1334,9517,54961,361,409,4160,953,5019,1760,978,1414,514,4160,953,13,5034,1913,409,20662,87810,308,17771,6502,35597,272,1269,11,10071,7970,11,503,34155,25692,85815,55162,10036,13510,6316,14896,13,11876,39555,294,58591,73511,7769,11,409,1208,17536,11,409,1647,23008,52827,1880,951,15132,98385,52088,66474,15132,653,7970,514,4160,953,13,622,34155,72006,312,1195,25134,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,856,6492,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,17,704,315,220,20,369,24613,300,13071,627,198,791,19114,596,1984,374,539,9539,83280,11,323,279,33811,8111,311,387,14738,40146,13,578,1495,37856,6070,11,78925,11,323,20406,13537,1990,6848,13,23212,11,279,4221,1511,374,3629,55861,11,3339,433,5107,311,3619,1148,279,19114,374,4560,311,20599,627,198,8142,279,19114,1587,1456,311,3118,1063,6105,304,4799,315,1701,5933,323,33268,7384,11,1521,3585,527,539,13750,8040,477,7396,555,6029,13,24296,11,279,1495,5764,3892,25420,477,31715,47869,430,35453,533,505,279,8244,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,627,198,28589,11,1418,279,19114,1253,617,1695,34334,11,872,1984,374,539,1664,1824,61869,477,36961,11559,10666,11,902,26338,279,66343,2410,315,279,8982,13,128009],"total_dur
