They also use storytelling techniques to make their points more relatable, such as comparing vaccination to a \"grand débat\" or explaining the complexities of vaccination like a detective trying to solve a mystery. Additionally, they show empathy for those affected by the disease and emphasize the importance of prevention.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that some parts of the speech feel somewhat disorganized, with the speaker jumping between different ideas and examples without fully developing them. This can make it slightly harder to follow their train of thought at times. Overall, however, the speaker's passion, creativity, and ability to connect with the audience are strong, making their message more persuasive than not.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,6502,4502,9189,47592,84228,64591,11,10071,1370,9953,409,47165,11,272,17771,62891,27138,11,272,17771,409,1055,84,1685,593,28463,4684,76366,1744,409,1370,9953,409,79036,3869,653,11884,978,10367,67628,13,7508,818,308,17771,294,69537,541,11,5019,16968,514,38900,3869,653,55847,11,76076,951,4020,85,6091,13348,645,9465,505,53410,1880,514,43849,11,27584,15265,6800,27138,1744,503,26248,547,13,95178,77776,5636,10775,978,1765,1208,30545,483,11,1744,1765,3625,14027,1354,11,3869,4538,3937,3869,13510,13,1708,1105,11,87320,272,17771,28463,4684,76366,30,2394,118904,561,409,3488,13,622,49152,2852,23423,978,11,42676,272,17771,6316,80444,409,25626,7591,14034,11,10071,7970,11,3900,1826,24560,85424,11,41199,16968,514,27584,1744,4864,9189,1370,648,653,28800,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,65381,1647,55847,11,3900,379,264,653,4046,70,42625,7591,23827,519,7010,7643,20028,11,3900,379,264,514,57705,12339,27389,688,333,951,14027,1354,13,18925,12333,12,6496,12,593,294,31109,7187,11,1880,4864,1446,2192,25945,1206,1334,11,665,44314,519,16968,514,27584,294,31109,84921,7930,264,14175,285,294,39982,14081,2836,16339,951,8811,17491,13,34447,3869,9517,6583,25108,1215,653,23496,4381,556,11,409,47929,4502,9189,47592,51913,13109,11,28699,15760,8065,14027,258,11,6033,77433,3869,15265,7970,1841,1764,11,48488,5636,4684,76366,294,31769,23827,261,13,1708,1105,11,4864,9189,9148,554,11,1647,81337,11,389,11412,259,9011,9211,951,13458,2852,409,43905,3273,17060,2428,11,389,308,26248,6502,4839,1133,63669,409,39043,665,3846,4545,11,44829,503,98279,24281,1744,4502,9189,64609,283,64519,89,57926,978,1765,653,89781,16983,665,3738,294,6,3457,11,39043,841,550,15433,14687,6502,16968,3869,20272,665,7643,282,525,324,13,16062,16081,11,39043,10390,1395,14707,11,7643,270,4558,325,1370,273,409,47165,11,7317,391,99188,11,7930,274,6,1617,20234,6316,8811,329,648,46939,665,1685,325,13,2009,28439,409,3846,51655,1099,8511,13,16770,11,4864,63762,11,7643,1099,12339,1880,281,10515,684,11,389,60946,6502,42676,4864,757,834,13,34447,665,27584,27138,11,272,17771,3930,924,978,3055,648,13,356,17771,22299,4046,5192,1082,10039,87,13,19421,22299,4046,5192,1082,10039,87,11,39043,55729,648,1744,264,30870,1557,13,24703,7930,665,5891,29097,1826,48488,5636,9024,5019,653,1589,1082,10039,87,13,356,17771,1744,39043,55729,648,28463,13,432,5512,26235,11,6316,4046,4714,283,11,4160,556,27584,1208,65104,817,4173,275,1604,13,14465,9189,93569,6669,10670,1744,490,1791,13,350,77025,7970,949,13789,11,389,11412,1860,11967,33670,1744,39043,45441,78422,519,13,27058,62998,379,26248,1744,39043,308,6,22290,6316,11347,7010,20662,8811,329,648,949,4366,346,1744,11,1744,3625,38546,829,343,1157,5309,306,15132,5916,14014,13,34447,28463,11,1880,6800,11,1880,665,20272,11,26725,3625,2942,288,56311,23761,93381,21719,13,432,680,414,285,308,17771,802,65220,653,35019,339,2727,11,1647,16968,11,1880,6316,29253,85624,89714,1615,729,4088,7010,20662,8811,329,648,13,356,17771,436,613,519,409,25911,13,2009,2605,78,625,1133,1744,39043,665,264,409,70175,24875,288,11,22299,7010,40744,3625,8811,17491,3313,12828,8699,11,272,17771,1744,29449,6916,8047,11,29449,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,7930,14464,84,1339,1647,5363,5019,17317,1760,978,1414,45973,3625,30020,11,687,1188,951,259,13649,288,11,951,13307,3930,92713,11,7930,594,28111,306,665,16968,1486,653,4316,2159,46110,107954,266,1880,7930,5019,61512,274,6,370,1295,12155,2942,288,13,56744,72,27750,259,13649,288,11,389,665,264,3608,90859,6316,9517,2295,809,2439,3869,6033,69,3869,11,3460,288,409,5457,71269,33888,409,1208,63922,668,45973,3625,17188,665,37622,4725,13,4418,66,11,39043,665,21559,409,70175,24875,288,1880,3625,30179,812,665,21965,25626,10484,13109,1880,409,3355,268,308,17771,5043,13,362,32384,11,77433,3869,29449,14027,258,958,680,266,2428,11,10071,294,31109,9822,11,42676,27584,11,9517,2295,809,2439,3869,6033,69,3869,7930,912,38672,82,11,409,96308,33022,1821,763,1257,38647,7930,912,38672,82,11,10071,6502,1081,536,11,10071,17508,31914,580,5019,9517,306,969,25108,1215,514,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,665,54008,1291,12155,4225,35154,5809,14014,1880,1989,46138,409,29449,6916,8047,13,1952,264,84788,72,3869,9765,462,16339,951,88143,2311,11,3460,288,409,8381,15802,6160,1640,2428,4502,9189,55162,41881,11,10071,15878,3625,4824,76,1154,1080,74083,76743,2249,11,5019,2961,1553,4502,9517,2295,809,2439,3869,6033,69,3869,11,38682,8646,1765,1208,4197,13109,1880,48416,8977,3869,1208,4824,53410,13,16062,16081,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,389,264,84788,72,3869,43678,12155,20897,1056,4558,8696,1491,4558,6256,665,39538,266,2428,409,1208,3678,329,648,11,665,6033,409,69067,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433
