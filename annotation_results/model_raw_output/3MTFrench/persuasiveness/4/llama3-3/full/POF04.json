Additionally, some parts of the speech may not be as engaging or memorable for all listeners.\n\nOverall, the speaker does an excellent job of presenting their message in a clear and persuasive manner, but could improve by varying their tone and using more vivid language to capture the audience's attention.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,19421,85321,1880,9622,46138,11,7970,30362,13,14465,36731,97717,934,35329,379,264,951,76650,409,22463,1370,8318,9189,11,10071,7930,272,17771,60019,294,6,283,484,306,514,2605,1188,13,74656,11,4864,91507,9189,15473,444,466,6316,87810,13,11842,6502,73103,951,649,300,11405,417,7930,3073,306,7010,3625,15471,417,11,10071,73103,951,649,300,22463,7930,1081,27462,74699,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,3900,379,264,514,23744,52760,1880,272,17771,24955,2320,950,11,294,31109,7138,14379,324,5048,13,432,3251,288,951,1069,29423,1499,1572,80463,7930,665,326,41901,220,16,931,14848,34512,96559,9465,15907,46106,45740,2530,665,951,2606,4918,409,15395,316,75104,3869,1208,4160,458,1880,10253,4046,998,3742,13,35211,288,6136,288,11,3625,14848,88778,978,294,6,25108,645,13,2998,46152,11,27549,1826,46798,81,1056,8047,11,2847,288,11,11083,27549,1709,14081,1056,8047,28463,326,6,269,16458,554,11,27549,28130,33537,1339,653,311,275,1880,27549,28130,2579,263,1215,514,20897,556,10253,60404,11,3869,1208,5320,4618,294,22827,43453,45640,5553,326,6,20100,17403,13,14465,9189,44314,2852,934,22827,1089,1412,519,78771,409,350,10515,285,11,40970,4635,84,1744,73103,951,1841,969,38672,9620,11,10071,15890,514,36875,13327,1826,1558,978,23349,11,25945,77818,13,386,49404,23156,409,326,49152,1339,57485,978,37953,409,4538,45640,665,220,1114,2495,13,7695,326,26248,294,6,52009,1759,7637,978,3869,326,6,25108,273,93848,13,4997,266,1082,89,8065,350,10515,285,11,27549,3567,1339,45575,1208,55133,934,22827,924,5192,978,3869,3206,99277,13,34447,42138,45889,35881,2734,552,409,82134,4046,2032,12249,3600,11,27549,264,24560,69241,582,8047,1370,951,4244,10515,5512,77580,11,379,1437,1814,1370,326,6,87713,7010,951,36282,409,81939,11,5553,379,14240,278,11,9189,326,6,461,4618,409,348,10670,3625,33651,4881,649,395,355,1744,16968,514,38900,74282,77422,14707,13,1708,1105,11,5019,2503,8977,75804,88253,665,79071,84064,265,11,1208,649,580,2249,1744,15907,220,1591,11990,294,89048,302,5518,45441,1208,55133,7829,62940,20487,665,8941,29005,713,13,34447,272,17771,28463,326,6,485,592,7379,3930,924,846,13,28460,79507,5019,25400,665,1028,11,2145,425,11191,294,6,76370,76195,13,650,969,3904,25945,78060,11,6316,87810,1744,523,5485,265,653,409,35573,3869,55056,261,13,27058,4046,265,43406,11,272,17771,665,220,679,19,13,356,17771,6316,37291,409,220,1627,8261,42138,1481,283,8890,258,39973,1744,4864,757,36731,92759,8047,9952,6316,38920,4046,61673,409,52571,1759,1880,409,4913,36527,13,44564,719,43989,409,2558,556,3930,1323,2727,3930,2847,1104,978,1880,389,264,326,41901,79196,68862,3625,649,288,7010,3625,503,569,1354,951,14464,1821,409,350,10515,285,11,7010,326,6,306,564,8047,3869,326,6,541,265,60172,13,34447,503,34155,653,28800,1208,83067,409,1208,34561,94943,7330,52760,665,28130,46320,665,514,46494,13,19421,14707,7216,89,45325,1744,17317,57038,59148,1653,40744,3460,288,409,649,5599,41476,11,951,29465,4282,11,951,5309,288,11,10071,951,10485,276,1441,11,951,25595,23045,645,76145,1370,51173,13,3206,21134,42775,409,38317,264,39587,24560,409,3625,57705,978,6091,261,27448,1640,81235,11,3869,75249,514,594,16167,13,393,9425,78422,10515,81235,11,5019,274,6,395,7889,3930,15439,2145,4088,13,4072,645,14848,20272,514,21134,2463,11,84568,14848,76826,24560,27981,5512,42844,51854,65838,13,19421,39015,11,17317,57038,13550,285,87320,3625,52571,1759,14848,34280,978,951,36282,294,6,5923,1907,367,1880,1208,5636,409,2960,8261,13,2009,17634,1133,665,13200,3869,326,31769,28769,25692,348,32029,3930,4382,11,8065,24657,11,9465,6316,4244,39883,665,103915,3545,1880,6316,4244,39883,77580,13,34447,39015,11,17317,841,44314,2439,1744,409,2027,344,13109,10748,11,1744,13510,409,43153,802,9769,9004,13,9589,54312,1744,26077,447,22827,274,59858,1826,60019,92759,978,41199,2960,8261,30,3206,12717,65285,266,409,270,4558,325,1826,1744,26633,4244,10515,10610,677,645,409,29449,9192,2727,24724,6667,12844,3460,306,3930,326,13649,13,1952,20272,409,326,69537,978,9761,519,9952,25945,85114,409,3846,934,54386,25692,46524,7010,514,36754,13,34447,76776,11,84568,56311,23761,27981,5512,665,17332,11,3846,7930,1826,64284,11,1841,3900,274,6,74972,294,22827,47838,955,294,39982,1291,93828,11,73103,409,1208,94868,4618,1400,848,648,11,73103,294,22827,264,43406,31807,337,1143,77580,11,15878,39999,14842,5019,653,7591,65,3102,978,51199,11,66090,951,649,569,20969,13,25145,72,409,15265,6666,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,
