{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T18:08:13.51600753Z","response":"**SCORE: 4**\n\nBased on the transcript, I found the speaker's message to be effective and convincing. The reasoning appears rigorous, with logical connections between ideas. The speaker starts by setting the context of their concern about antibiotic resistance and then presents a specific solution (bacteriosines) as an alternative to traditional antibiotics.\n\nThe tone is engaging, and the speaker uses anecdotes (e.g., mentioning their own experience with antibiotic-resistant bacteria) to make the message more relatable and memorable. The use of simple language and analogies helps to explain complex concepts, making the speech accessible to a broader audience.\n\nHowever, I didn't find the speech to be perfect, which is why I scored it 4 instead of 5. While the speaker does provide some specific examples and data points to support their claims, they could have done more to establish credibility and authority on the topic. Additionally, the speech relies heavily on the audience's understanding of scientific concepts (e.g., bacteriosines), which might not be familiar to all listeners.\n\nOverall, I believe the speaker effectively crafts a convincing message that conveys their concern about antibiotic resistance and presents a potential solution.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,48109,74533,665,220,508,1135,11,503,26248,547,220,1591,8261,1880,1765,514,1486,294,69537,24889,13,24703,3567,14687,23761,514,5636,72006,9880,409,829,17536,13,19421,5019,61512,11,27549,1826,7317,13215,8047,13,46408,82113,648,4538,12985,294,31109,11091,268,20487,8065,934,83223,13,12095,503,26248,547,11,4864,94297,23761,281,7379,3869,272,24889,46206,27549,11,272,17771,66021,934,80720,829,275,13,3489,6853,92215,841,6502,23589,265,3869,6316,15907,42626,15564,13,19421,66021,934,80720,2098,355,593,4538,90551,92174,42138,503,34155,653,305,9769,79,2223,13,3341,7010,514,38900,409,503,26248,547,11,326,39982,9769,79,2223,1826,74450,68,409,100016,409,33689,2540,648,13,46706,514,38900,409,503,26248,547,11,3625,293,533,14081,919,4046,12821,96559,11,5318,978,1880,4538,409,1055,84,31807,380,5048,11,3869,326,91655,951,33209,8467,11,3869,5457,409,13510,89429,355,46956,8047,13,46706,514,38900,409,503,26248,547,11,3625,8811,17491,109488,645,11,3625,98385,16458,1439,1880,3625,1180,288,71546,5673,3074,2249,1370,1860,685,4382,13,14465,9189,7591,745,11,3846,308,17771,6502,66090,3930,463,8995,4632,3869,281,17270,326,6,11696,292,8065,326,42069,6798,3675,13,34447,514,18111,324,294,6,27588,385,18126,11,29449,38900,11,97487,513,834,65044,11,294,6,60917,12416,3625,27389,41115,951,13307,409,77323,11,653,18111,324,7930,513,21559,22299,514,81621,13,39783,3805,3273,17194,7294,1481,11345,560,39723,43905,1208,32118,8332,483,77580,1826,1323,1082,665,5353,13,27058,61512,11,1647,1984,1826,2700,12844,294,77025,5481,404,13,3959,27548,10253,33209,8467,3073,306,7010,1208,7138,15890,3625,293,533,28154,437,1572,13,24703,15132,951,22337,20243,2482,2558,3695,1370,951,293,533,978,4108,11,22299,44397,19395,648,409,47371,1137,5019,259,8977,294,81979,16948,2492,409,293,533,978,4108,1880,13080,1355,13,622,34155,4186,275,6316,67628,409,293,533,28154,437,1572,2558,3695,1370,6316,293,533,35285,409,1208,9943,265,63900,13,328,6,337,479,11,20662,293,533,35285,308,17771,6502,13171,409,3625,2558,556,665,409,71,1105,409,4538,39646,7138,75,13,46408,841,25692,514,20028,1744,37953,447,80720,1826,665,67754,822,325,11,272,17771,3869,13510,42676,27549,1826,89023,7881,8047,7010,326,55624,478,258,294,22827,40351,6033,294,22827,10065,13,356,17771,39587,3930,1327,265,554,11,27750,293,533,28154,437,1572,3869,31632,409,687,38965,39408,2259,2249,5019,68226,3625,14240,664,1291,1880,7591,23827,261,28130,18528,38094,2428,1880,28130,6070,13,2895,66096,3869,27750,44827,11,3900,264,45575,24560,3284,409,3625,14843,556,26633,893,59307,1989,1104,13327,645,665,5636,25626,10484,13109,13,19421,503,34155,4186,13109,3869,57485,28130,23878,13109,945,14081,8047,951,8811,17491,4225,978,87,648,4881,11,10071,28463,43153,33670,1154,1370,39474,10253,33209,8467,13,622,58736,2972,27467,12558,2734,1133,11,951,293,533,978,4108,3869,951,33209,8467,1880,3869,11083,293,533,28154,437,1572,13,19421,45575,42676,71686,45889,49301,3625,293,533,978,4108,3567,72,89810,31807,11451,288,3869,21797,33209,8467,11,27549,841,514,3567,26584,6502,3869,11083,293,533,28154,437,1572,13,1708,1105,11,3900,379,264,409,326,77025,5481,404,5019,1744,514,38900,409,99706,66167,6316,17422,13,362,17317,3625,52571,1759,409,46524,100198,951,27548,10253,33209,8467,31914,2492,1880,64032,1466,4978,13,34447,1208,38317,841,25692,20028,3663,3869,20662,81695,86806,13,46408,42182,23761,88778,8047,294,31109,51913,3294,11,951,55744,8467,409,1615,20372,367,951,33209,8467,3869,3625,19637,645,1647,32106,645,13,362,17317,26725,3869,9189,409,513,1491,31617,12329,5019,3869,326,6,306,404,1880,48416,8977,3846,1343,98078,48099,409,31807,4011,13,27058,841,56316,11751,261,7010,326,6,1334,1772,12,306,3904,648,3930,64160,13,27058,1744,1208,32118,8332,483,463,18297,325,1880,2536,1239,22550,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,82360,25,220,19,334,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1766,279,19114,596,1984,311,387,7524,323,40661,13,578,33811,8111,47999,11,449,20406,13537,1990,6848,13,578,19114,8638,555,6376,279,2317,315,872,4747,922,60595,13957,323,1243,18911,264,3230,6425,320,65,2540,3614,1572,8,439,459,10778,311,8776,46850,627,198,791,16630,374,23387,11,323,279,19114,5829,94066,320,68,13,70,2637,45391,872,1866,3217,449,60595,47056,24032,8,311,1304,279,1984,810,1375,15436,323,33596,13,578,1005,315,4382,4221,323,24291,552,8779,311,10552,6485,19476,11,3339,279,8982,15987,311,264,27927,10877,627,198,11458,11,358,3287,956,1505,
