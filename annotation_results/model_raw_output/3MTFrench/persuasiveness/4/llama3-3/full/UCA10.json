The speaker's use of rhetorical devices, such as metaphors (\"un mÃ©talisme\"), allusions (referencing the \"mÃ©talisme\" without explicitly defining it), and repetition (\"le mÃ©talisme\", repeated several times) creates a sense of unity and emphasizes their point about the interconnectedness of these concepts.\n\nHowever, I find some aspects of the speech less convincing. For instance:\n\n1. The speaker's argument relies heavily on abstract concepts and metaphors, which might make it challenging for listeners to follow or grasp the connection between these concepts.\n2. The language used is quite complex and dense, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.\n\nTo improve persuasiveness, I would suggest adding more concrete examples or analogies to illustrate their points, making the speech more relatable and easier to understand.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything or provide additional feedback! ðŸ˜Š","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,6316,57459,7930,28960,818,951,390,588,8839,4288,64545,12732,295,19289,10071,951,35030,292,1751,8467,1880,61397,1339,288,42587,15844,682,306,951,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,781,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,44618,11,514,36252,278,4918,665,1880,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,653,28800,5636,3062,409,1208,3488,13,34447,272,17771,60019,39015,1744,1208,3488,274,85217,19477,12059,7010,1647,21273,258,569,11,10071,41091,11,272,17771,28130,86,55169,13,4829,285,16968,3846,1744,503,6,92442,7319,1765,43905,1208,3488,13,38891,89,45325,934,31109,47838,14896,1744,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,40,4265,3021,311,1520,499,449,430,0,27623,232,198,198,29815,389,279,3984,36815,11,358,1053,15806,279,8982,596,24613,300,13071,1701,279,13167,330,7894,3210,11003,264,40661,1984,7673,439,11263,512,198,66068,25,510,16,12,20,60,198,198,76219,24557,25,21097,84,300,13071,315,279,8982,198,198,66913,25,55215,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,627,198,22818,279,6485,323,8278,7138,315,279,8712,14407,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,420,8982,264,220,18,704,315,220,20,13,578,19114,596,1005,315,87068,7766,11,1778,439,31768,1105,3573,359,36252,278,44618,4063,682,36807,320,42260,11627,279,330,76,10515,278,44618,1,2085,21650,27409,433,705,323,54515,3573,273,36252,278,44618,498,11763,3892,3115,8,11705,264,5647,315,31426,323,66159,872,1486,922,279,83416,2136,315,1521,19476,627,198,11458,11,358,1505,1063,13878,315,279,8982,2753,40661,13,1789,2937,512,198,16,13,578,19114,596,5811,34744,17345,389,8278,19476,323,31768,1105,11,902,2643,1304,433,17436,369,24475,311,1833,477,34477,279,3717,1990,1521,19476,13,198,17,13,578,4221,1511,374,5115,6485,323,29050,11,902,1253,4017,1202,40800,311,264,27927,10877,627,198,1271,7417,24613,300,13071,11,358,1053,4284,7999,810,14509,10507,477,24291,552,311,41468,872,3585,11,3339,279,8982,810,1375,15436,323,8831,311,3619,627,198,5618,1095,757,1440,422,499,4265,1093,757,311,38263,4205,477,3493,5217,11302,0,27623,232,128009],"total_duration":9725737523,"load_duration":200384,"prompt_eval_count":624,"prompt_eval_duration":1189720000,"eval_count":285,"eval_duration":8535254000}
