The speaker presents their ideas clearly and logically, but some parts feel repetitive or overly focused on specific examples rather than presenting a balanced argument. Additionally, there are moments where the language becomes too general or vague, which might make it harder for the audience to fully grasp the message.\n\nPlease note that this score is based solely on my understanding of the transcript, without any prior knowledge about the topic or the speaker's intentions.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1880,3625,21935,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,7930,15132,665,2035,409,1208,17536,11,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,5016,743,315,11470,4999,198,1271,15806,420,36815,11,358,690,2980,279,13167,315,98224,11,602,1770,2637,3508,279,1732,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,449,47999,33811,627,198,29815,389,856,6492,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,3146,18,334,704,315,220,20,13,578,19114,18911,872,6848,9539,323,74145,11,719,1063,5596,2733,59177,477,39532,10968,389,3230,10507,4856,1109,32644,264,24770,5811,13,23212,11,1070,527,14269,1405,279,4221,9221,2288,4689,477,40146,11,902,2643,1304,433,16127,369,279,10877,311,7373,34477,279,1984,627,198,5618,5296,430,420,5573,374,3196,21742,389,856,8830,315,279,36815,11,2085,904,4972,6677,922,279,8712,477,279,19114,596,34334,13,128009],"total_duration":5666557788,"load_duration":134052,"prompt_eval_count":830,"prompt_eval_duration":1561357000,"eval_count":137,"eval_duration":4104633000}
