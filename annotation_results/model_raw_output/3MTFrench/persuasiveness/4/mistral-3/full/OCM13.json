However, I can provide a score based on the written content alone according to the provided scale:\n\nDIMENSION = 4\n\nThe speech presents some compelling statistics and makes an argument for why it is important to focus on attracting Indian tourists. The speaker also suggests potential solutions and emphasizes the need for collaboration among various stakeholders in the industry. However, some parts of the speech may be unclear or repetitive, and there could be more specific examples or evidence provided to strengthen the argument. Overall, the speech seems persuasive but could benefit from additional details and a clearer structure.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,19422,4038,19337,28747,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,327,733,28705,451,8884,1514,484,2728,411,1415,7113,10425,28723,689,13768,2232,2110,28725,1521,5097,28723,13542,277,28742,374,15053,9628,28723,2678,27655,28764,481,28705,28750,28734,28740,28787,28723,16035,1338,485,1147,28705,28787,2422,462,15004,264,15545,357,28797,1206,423,340,543,2623,21056,28723,28705,29215,28708,13212,363,1228,955,305,28742,28762,28619,8768,934,543,28705,28781,28706,23227,340,4843,2669,543,5006,28737,634,7113,15099,1233,434,10568,28723,13542,28705,2650,28725,462,7113,10425,28725,277,28742,374,521,877,2345,412,1147,28705,28740,28734,28723,28705,29215,28708,13212,363,1228,955,305,28742,370,2306,28707,416,5082,340,1776,361,28705,10456,427,462,20351,19802,9078,438,424,501,340,26708,340,28705,28770,28734,28734,11076,281,28742,507,2397,381,28723,550,607,16906,6884,5620,24380,28705,28770,28734,28734,11076,28725,277,28742,374,28300,15396,543,4889,21801,28723,13542,9628,3418,28710,28725,2218,519,278,4221,426,7340,955,305,28742,28762,28619,8768,264,16065,1514,1289,8466,2669,6737,281,1238,8821,24303,3698,24265,28723,976,734,7705,28764,28723,19479,791,872,431,6702,462,307,28906,4110,12122,15349,2669,6737,281,1238,28804,334,28742,374,19341,7113,6508,28723,550,607,28725,27462,16906,28486,465,28764,28733,28728,607,14257,28764,634,1558,9603,28804,13542,9628,3418,28710,28725,2218,284,1058,955,1514,7113,15099,1176,722,11631,28725,356,3432,2448,340,1558,9603,28723,13542,277,28742,374,26941,955,461,28742,1585,8582,8052,634,7151,28723,351,563,864,3466,3670,7249,267,1147,16065,1514,575,4544,3025,14632,434,677,281,28742,4373,441,425,361,28725,312,1210,361,911,15349,15283,361,11844,16421,4601,7113,15099,28723,2332,3222,1759,381,1424,4110,481,1633,28804,2332,8668,14983,28725,526,1190,9804,28804,13542,2669,364,3950,3557,2219,24303,1829,1011,28804,550,607,305,28742,458,28764,25093,28804,351,563,864,934,430,886,4970,1197,28723,4926,2868,412,28725,7165,296,28725,1829,1011,28733,322,28733,288,28725,14128,7851,28725,8821,26590,631,14055,485,8466,462,15004,940,358,526,28742,3222,28725,940,358,955,8466,462,15004,934,5475,2741,28797,2422,3670,28146,28723,1343,26708,3466,340,1448,262,28725,8821,26590,631,934,2278,28723,976,734,28725,2218,284,1058,955,10404,7113,15099,1176,12306,28725,356,3432,2448,28725,526,28742,266,427,277,4276,340,1101,1337,287,848,335,340,1326,28541,934,340,285,4652,3160,263,1514,7944,4511,2208,677,1442,28723,14527,305,28742,28716,14924,301,28733,28754,309,28725,543,1846,28708,2394,28725,1514,7363,23254,4030,28725,911,10274,16906,28725,2144,8582,390,337,521,28725,2422,363,385,6768,28723,976,734,28725,277,28742,374,363,27097,28725,1521,337,264,5465,28725,277,28742,374,7944,28723,2661,337,264,462,1326,4545,294,2805,334,28733,28762,28725,1521,337,264,305,28742,28716,14924,301,340,4843,28725,5359,268,1344,28764,955,317,1554,28725,19255,5497,481,5835,340,3201,1116,481,11450,263,462,11853,28797,1176,1375,28723,976,734,28725,461,28742,14043,3228,28725,461,28742,14043,3228,28725,5359,281,28742,314,4854,815,22320,28725,955,16906,5271,5219,416,11223,340,3670,2470,28723,475,28742,14043,3228,955,3670,2470,26050,462,1101,935,2470,2278,28725,7944,16906,28723,13542,461,28742,14043,3228,955,11989,1011,16906,6419,11693,263,28797,634,3884,15099,934,467,602,1442,2422,459,267,26372,536,28725,16906,16906,791,311,1097,28764,28725,16906,28725,1147,3670,955,16906,8631,20650,15349,28725,2669,15216,1554,1514,932,441,425,361,28723,4709,28705,9730,20336,12303,10398,477,28705,28740,28746,1478,438,544,298,28705,28782,28746,646,1188,28723,4709,3284,28755,1020,8439,12303,657,574,7382,28725,910,14861,293,495,349,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,28725,613,28723,28706,2063,511,272,1338,11466,9949,264,4221,26455,2928,28804,1691,652,24685,10536,15138,28804,4709,28738,16804,12303,16627,11931,1203,2489,302,272,798,4397,2078,297,272,320,4943,3315,16373,28738,4211,28723,1791,2380,910,15627,378,28725,938,272,5436,302,272,9711,5397,297,272,4211,384,4019,1020,8439,28723,16104,9688,9880,624,1474,390,396,4372,387,456,1474,349,264,7420,304,378,659,298,347,2078,2818,356,272,5657,5397,297,272,9730,20336,4211,20148,28705,733,28748,16289,28793,315,3573,5090,15627,272,14861,293,9992,302,272,8666,297,456,1203,2489,1671,4870,2758,442,6399,302,272,17153,28742,28713,25087,28725,10294,28725,304,2187,3842,28723,2993,28725,315,541,3084,264,7420,2818,356,272,4241,3036,4411,4771,298,272,3857,5657,28747,13,13,3284,28755,1020,8439,327,28705,28781,13,13,1014,8666,15890,741,26295,13110,304,2870,396,5270,354,2079,378,349,2278,298,3232,356,6842,288,6735,25313,28723,415,17153,835,12308,4628,7151,304,10574,5004,272,927,354,15609,3352,4118,15790,15523,297,272,4779,28723,2993,28725,741,5099,302,272,8666,993,347,521,6206,442,21435,2468,28725,304,736,829,347,680,2948,9254,442,5566,3857,298,15974,272,5270,28723,21013,28725,272,8666,3969,14861,293,495,562,829,7949,477,4870,4162,304,264,3081,263,4693,28723],"total_duration":5874779586,"load_duration":246527,"prompt_eval_count"
