The speaker presents a clear argument and provides examples to support their claims, but there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous.\n\nThe speaker effectively frames the issue as one of finding solutions to allow biodiversity to recover in fragmented habitats. They also acknowledge the complexity of the problem and recognize the importance of involving local actors in the solution-finding process. However, there are some instances where the reasoning could be more rigorous:\n\n1. The speaker uses a simplistic analogy of a biche (deer) crossing a road to make their point about the importance of connectivity for biodiversity. While this analogy is effective in illustrating the point, it oversimplifies the complexity of real-world ecological systems.\n2. The speaker's argument that \"the role of my thesis is to bring knowledge on the human dimension of these solutions\" could be more nuanced. While it is true that the speaker's research focuses on the human aspect of biodiversity conservation, there are many other dimensions to consider as well (e.g., ecological, economic, social).\n3. The speaker's claim that \"the entire region finances the replanting of these areas\" could be more rigorously supported with evidence. While it is possible that some regions may provide funding for biodiversity conservation efforts, it is unlikely that the entire region does so.\n4. The speaker's call to action for local actors to \"rethink\" their approaches to biodiversity conservation could be more specific and actionable. Instead of simply encouraging local actors to \"rethink,\" the speaker could provide more concrete recommendations for how they can contribute to biodiversity conservation efforts.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous, the speaker effectively presents their argument and provides examples to support their claims.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1459,2460,7890,2257,29627,29892,432,29915,326,22094,712,7890,29871,22730,20081,29892,4875,707,21617,29884,427,11510,307,29892,427,3593,29892,2123,427,3147,698,262,2353,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,6701,316,3681,29892,427,4239,26893,29892,427,323,22928,29892,274,29915,342,5246,29889,1459,8474,29892,1444,26099,544,9061,818,610,631,712,26744,29871,1654,452,325,993,316,425,289,473,29890,283,280,29889,2581,301,29915,1794,22577,289,18041,1943,868,4158,361,6555,1750,452,24722,2298,1209,29948,782,640,5270,29889,853,20744,29892,7814,17631,4620,4110,17631,3906,553,22035,5313,1973,14458,13876,634,18165,29876,1379,29889,8748,1354,274,29915,342,325,17016,1671,8556,29892,966,3165,2708,29892,274,29915,342,325,17016,5695,1671,966,3778,2993,29889,1954,22094,29920,610,17488,13180,13545,832,1934,712,7890,29871,22730,1437,14836,29889,838,11867,29892,8532,2779,19882,29892,7890,452,7890,289,3498,29920,2331,427,3147,698,262,2353,19507,14090,1190,553,3147,16461,12935,29892,3503,7890,427,544,10281,553,2665,4285,23734,743,2123,7890,480,573,29920,553,904,5547,1671,7890,1437,13974,2265,29889,6803,7890,29892,1465,26814,13386,316,289,436,267,29892,966,5039,7719,3165,13116,29892,301,29915,25006,4371,29892,2123,301,29915,524,575,2450,29892,301,29915,351,2200,12896,13855,2689,966,4760,1446,1750,7890,3435,7853,519,634,301,29915,6698,743,720,29948,21553,1387,1750,19172,296,316,966,337,4926,29889,1720,269,29915,23121,8532,316,534,8885,553,6851,1671,19397,19172,276,316,1841,3891,29880,381,5278,3133,2131,904,21553,1387,29889,951,17889,316,611,266,17449,427,5646,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,932,9555,553,17043,790,2925,1190,425,9927,3165,9874,316,7015,6851,29889,341,1004,7561,29881,29892,301,29915,26739,362,634,301,29915,264,339,9061,29889,6803,301,29915,26739,362,29892,1444,28511,1671,1841,13094,553,1044,11620,1750,1539,29873,296,443,29871,19898,7015,6851,1671,8689,966,1444,1314,316,19397,29889,6803,301,29915,264,339,9061,29892,1444,966,1006,307,1173,9411,4348,27751,1671,7015,11382,1575,782,9426,29889,1459,17488,29892,14034,29920,1597,6815,3814,9221,23249,274,16555,2606,1908,29892,12796,1318,610,4239,784,1475,363,11521,5908,29889,997,289,4070,29892,712,7890,29871,22730,29892,263,3008,28230,316,27962,316,301,29915,1540,818,301,29915,18288,29889,1105,361,712,18097,7890,18331,29920,782,13222,29892,7890,19643,29920,16731,439,29915,309,302,29915,29891,263,2331,21394,316,904,5547,1671,7890,274,11665,7628,316,26814,13310,1318,29889,11948,7890,29871,22730,19872,1314,29892,1444,454,29758,6079,29892,7890,7890,28905,29920,18097,6701,29889,1174,1791,424,18097,6701,3479,946,1759,29892,634,7890,8992,29920,6079,18836,29892,1559,21975,454,13222,7890,6454,15325,1190,443,9221,12906,371,332,1750,7890,6309,29889,10016,288,23270,29892,29871,4277,8164,7848,330,5512,749,818,17103,270,29915,1540,610,3729,663,316,29892,3503,980,1702,13871,712,425,14326,1436,749,1671,427,337,9018,357,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,1794,8164,29899,5474,1841,1579,17192,381,29889,9194,280,1875,29892,7890,1671,2146,573,29920,26814,26786,1190,443,17887,2665,631,1045,11728,29892,7890,867,4895,29920,782,14858,28667,711,29948,29889,751,392,5646,818,17103,29892,7890,29271,346,13325,782,658,262,553,521,5793,1295,29889,3674,29892,18916,29892,7890,5246,267,2331,966,4439,1144,868,17103,29889,11948,7890,7890,19643,29920,325,568,16731,1750,3435,10259,4211,743,270,29915,21264,362,316,13047,316,425,5469,29889,8748,439,29915,309,1841,1579,17192,5582,21285,634,6314,19882,29892,3479,1095,307,1169,966,2298,11406,7844,29892,1671,19397,337,9018,357,553,28125,324,271,29948,279,1169,29899,517,29875,29889,390,465,332,29948,29892,7890,6773,29920,1437,506,271,882,634,2313,29878,23855,882,1224,425,301,275,5289,316,425,363,11992,634,7890,18331,29920,316,26814,21384,29889,360,29915,348,1775,262,29892,454,8182,275,882,316,301,29915,24031,553,427,1324,1314,8288,712,316,14984,966,19313,316,301,29915,24031,553,1044,11620,5932,743,29892,592,14924,818,425,10098,270,29915,932,9555,553,17043,790,2925,1190,425,16987,427,29871,19898,316,301,29915,2467,2529,9854,427,3444,29889,8748,8648,29892,553,25179,787,267,3022,29878,21017,634,1015,10500,29876,4999,1671,966,1044,11620,1180,2993,29889,28079,29871,4277,1671,439,29915,585,2186,29892,7890,29892,289,4070,29892,7890,2653,790,26477,1020,369,643,26814,3814,29889,11948,782,29899,6144,30001,29892,301,29915,24031,868,27264,484,13019,2653,5582,3911,5695,1020,369,643,5278,3814,29892,2123,6701,1601,357,818,3681,29892,634,6701,269,29915,309,427,263,8829,347,29892,8019,553,3581,369,1372,454,4158,361,6555,29889,4514,29871,317,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,29924,1430,13381,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,20657
