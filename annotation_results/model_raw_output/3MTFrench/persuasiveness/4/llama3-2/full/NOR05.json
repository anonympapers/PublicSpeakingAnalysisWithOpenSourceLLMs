Here's why:\n\nWhile the speaker does try to persuade the audience with their argument about using microwaves to create a clean and ecological fuel source, there are several issues that detract from the persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nFirstly, the language used is often unclear and lacks technical precision. The speaker jumps abruptly between ideas without providing sufficient explanations or supporting evidence. This makes it difficult for the audience to follow their argument.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's reasoning is not rigorous. They make claims about the potential benefits of using microwaves to create fuel without providing any concrete data or scientific backing. This lack of empirical evidence undermines the credibility of their argument.\n\nThirdly, the speech lacks a clear structure and logical flow. The speaker jumps between different topics (e.g., baguettes, biomass, etc.) without providing a clear connection between them. This makes it hard to follow the argument and understand how the various ideas are related.\n\nLastly, the tone of the speech is somewhat informal and lacking in professional polish. While this might be suitable for an academic or technical setting, it may not be effective in a public performance context where audience engagement and credibility are crucial.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for their topic are admirable, the persuasive power of the speech is limited by its unclear language, lack of rigorous reasoning, and poor structure.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,708,404,13,356,17771,4046,783,52985,1744,1208,628,455,472,951,48577,49733,5019,4538,8162,263,5019,13826,2084,3625,5954,2201,417,1880,409,841,513,15132,56316,6669,1572,294,49963,12329,3625,296,20243,2298,5019,20028,3625,44545,21041,409,326,49152,283,6400,13,46408,264,84850,4558,21152,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,423,49963,12329,6316,57709,13109,8162,263,5019,20028,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,13,13789,11,503,6,26577,648,1744,9189,9189,7631,10333,22299,39043,15572,68,11,934,17771,54312,1744,503,34155,20272,294,58591,337,370,354,13,7777,11,13085,89,1744,9189,274,6,4842,4558,44974,11,1880,9189,864,55506,653,9145,84,6672,11,16968,463,648,11,653,9145,84,6672,409,281,9011,2727,13,80905,463,648,11,4046,12821,309,978,466,7010,326,6,17060,292,2298,13,12095,9189,93569,89,1208,9145,84,6672,294,6,87290,451,10390,1395,11,27549,11412,23761,1437,30872,75,8047,11,1880,15265,31547,942,35737,84871,409,282,372,14014,13,423,6,31936,936,11,503,6,301,6,25632,6181,282,372,8047,294,58591,337,370,354,6033,294,6,33707,49090,483,13,622,34155,281,11399,68,1647,513,69,3972,11,503,34155,326,26248,1321,2439,1880,503,34155,15925,653,12046,579,44545,1260,13,1708,1105,11,308,26248,6033,3209,519,934,80720,1028,1370,273,13,622,49152,2852,6502,326,17771,54312,1744,1208,48687,665,9145,84,6672,13,622,34155,28463,12611,978,294,53149,9484,265,6316,47838,5634,28154,2933,5636,91329,1640,2428,13,39783,5634,28154,2933,7930,312,1911,519,3625,99309,348,1821,48577,409,326,31769,64374,665,6033,899,481,665,477,9769,13,356,17771,5634,28154,2933,274,53149,6853,1208,17536,8065,58617,13,5034,17536,8065,58617,11,272,17771,43905,5634,20712,2942,2428,294,6,4775,483,39892,1880,10065,7930,25692,23761,5276,8047,665,4046,64374,13,4366,51173,11,293,536,1557,11,1208,5945,375,409,326,6,351,2265,10745,1826,28463,514,66304,13,356,17771,1208,1744,272,17771,46680,265,1208,55133,3488,409,86374,13,12535,281,4168,265,503,49963,12329,20662,39538,13559,30,435,1339,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,13,13789,11,281,1791,6985,11,503,98146,26577,648,294,31109,13988,15433,978,7930,274,53149,6853,1208,281,556,8065,41380,13,5034,281,556,8065,41380,11,272,17771,1208,7591,49241,30945,2428,294,31109,5634,28154,2933,294,22827,14036,764,12339,274,5770,19472,11,5019,39929,470,782,8747,11,3930,95917,7970,11,7591,70,13559,2536,9955,729,481,11,10253,12303,6033,12046,579,6033,3900,44545,1260,13,11842,11,3900,10253,12303,6033,12046,579,13,12535,9964,439,33614,1208,17536,8065,58617,9952,409,8162,263,5019,20028,409,326,6,44545,1260,30,13789,11,3900,47090,47929,1744,7010,6316,57709,13109,409,8162,263,3900,379,264,951,26467,98151,442,3326,10515,8467,9465,665,3567,2303,425,13,19421,7930,11,665,11751,519,409,3729,9952,1208,17536,8065,58617,11,39043,20272,1744,514,60821,2428,56445,3869,30870,15610,13,13789,11,22299,272,17771,54008,266,11,1069,89,6502,30870,484,978,22299,23464,978,11,39043,5353,6316,39676,3869,326,55624,57663,409,1208,17536,8065,58617,13,1219,2727,40744,3625,9517,12821,4065,13,2206,11,272,17771,39676,8528,73267,11,3869,1208,5788,409,523,61047,11,1880,44351,1208,7591,49241,30945,2428,7930,2558,1082,514,44545,1260,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,21965,326,6,329,1104,13109,409,7643,1296,13,24971,1744,41091,11,3900,47090,1744,503,34155,100162,409,4647,625,978,11,5019,1097,73511,15171,1208,44225,11,1880,514,3729,951,102369,2439,98151,442,3326,10515,8467,11,5019,1097,73511,15171,3625,523,5763,1759,409,1208,17536,8065,58617,11,1880,44351,11,39043,7591,49241,11,3625,523,5763,1759,409,1208,17536,8065,58617,11,1880,44351,1208,5788,409,44545,1260,13,13789,11,3900,379,264,49733,4502,11,1744,294,6,14283,18111,324,11,7643,1296,11,9189,274,17771,7591,70,9011,2641,11,3869,20028,15265,83187,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,11,46206,9189,11,3869,2807,265,15265,1343,78,2427,20372,292,2298,11,25145,72,48488,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,459,7185,36815,4999,198,6153,38663,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,3146,17,334,704,315,220,20,13,5810,596,3249,512,198,8142,279,19114,1587,1456,311,51041,279,10877,449,872,5811,922,1701,19748,654,4798,311,1893,264,4335,323,50953,10633,2592,11,1070,527,3892,4819,430,35453,533,505,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,627,198,5451,398,11,279,4221,1511,374,3629,25420,323,37856,11156,16437,13,578,19114,35308,60845,1990,6848,2085,8405,14343,41941,477,12899,6029,13,1115,3727,433,5107,369,279,10877,311,1833,872,5811,627,198,16041,398,11,279
