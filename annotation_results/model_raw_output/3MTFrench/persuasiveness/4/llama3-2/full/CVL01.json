Using a clear and concise structure to present their argument.\n2. Providing specific examples and anecdotes to illustrate their points.\n3. Showing enthusiasm and passion for their topic, which makes it more engaging and persuasive.\n4. Addressing potential counterarguments and concerns, demonstrating thoughtfulness and consideration of alternative perspectives.\n\nThe only aspect that prevents me from giving a perfect score is the occasional use of colloquialisms and informal language, which might not be universally understood or appealing to all audiences. However, these minor flaws do not significantly diminish the overall persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nPlease note that this evaluation is based on my understanding of the transcript and may vary depending on individual perspectives and cultural backgrounds.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,445,2852,53070,1474,6870,9189,1153,261,6316,86806,1880,4382,3488,13,85046,308,7404,1481,5164,3869,5636,35149,2933,10071,6316,523,581,283,13,1708,1105,11,7970,11,4864,9517,79,66522,11,82291,308,7404,1481,5164,1208,17258,273,308,7404,83097,10071,39723,308,7404,63484,1481,283,264,11,272,17771,54312,1744,22299,39043,2536,949,445,6496,11,503,34155,42587,978,6316,13033,31037,7930,9189,264,14175,285,409,64972,60946,265,3846,1744,4864,834,2852,13,19421,272,17771,13033,31037,11,272,17771,1208,96282,951,1879,288,1880,272,17771,39015,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,3206,30532,1744,1208,96282,951,1879,288,1826,653,704,321,281,15433,55180,2428,665,37417,13,46408,11412,29557,10367,665,67781,294,31769,645,261,326,79351,11,1218,20995,11,3869,64972,917,43711,71,1693,3625,46430,1056,1154,1880,3869,64972,60946,265,3846,1744,22011,76385,978,59110,13,2998,67781,11,409,13026,4881,14240,29246,14848,1647,376,978,1744,1208,13033,31037,29557,83,1339,294,69537,978,1126,8065,6225,3930,2624,2530,13,5034,96282,951,1879,288,1826,1218,361,409,326,6,833,351,19395,978,346,4088,11,4502,653,68061,59110,1879,68,665,27584,27138,934,35329,40142,326,6,90446,11,3625,326,4558,69,288,60946,969,64972,3846,7930,1826,22011,13,356,8458,51913,2058,1339,39587,3625,2389,36807,409,78199,1880,409,6225,11,22299,37953,447,54386,665,1826,3663,3869,951,5105,268,1769,11,951,78199,7930,14848,1208,27584,78605,685,11,6033,87158,326,54386,1826,3663,3869,951,1370,7987,288,11,951,78199,7930,513,594,28111,306,11,10071,7930,308,6,546,6502,1208,27584,47371,4144,11,19227,1744,6666,6033,14944,13,4366,51173,11,4502,4864,62163,653,33013,79351,409,757,21273,10670,653,297,1082,2933,7930,121839,13,7695,11412,409,779,72,1744,4864,841,25400,62163,6502,409,757,21273,10670,653,297,1082,2933,7930,121839,11,7930,7591,33936,11,10071,653,297,1082,2933,7930,121839,13,4418,66,11,1208,96282,951,1879,288,11412,2536,71686,4046,376,332,458,5019,3625,33013,4558,2396,1218,29410,11,294,6,1056,301,4558,14668,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,3625,33013,4558,2396,7930,14848,951,5945,79155,409,13550,978,71,2711,1880,7930,14848,3930,8811,3869,1208,44178,16271,1880,76076,78199,463,8696,11,10071,11412,44767,91878,3625,33013,4558,2396,1218,29410,11,834,51480,2428,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,66056,7930,14848,653,12544,3930,8859,425,21308,13,2998,20272,11,272,17771,22299,4502,4864,44314,2852,9952,3625,5945,79155,409,53345,1474,5615,9004,2442,812,13,356,17771,78422,532,11,3900,379,264,26633,5636,7010,7643,37417,11,503,34155,18757,84228,16339,1744,1208,96282,951,1879,288,91878,3869,1208,32118,6489,404,8082,46206,3625,33013,4558,2396,1218,29410,13,23097,375,41881,45325,42676,9189,14240,74466,46110,11,1744,9189,27114,466,951,1615,625,288,11,389,1826,42587,5512,2536,21430,11,514,46110,24932,2431,78,7930,60172,829,57459,665,6672,11,9189,264,61158,301,978,13,19421,14707,11,272,17771,77433,8065,13033,68,11,3869,59394,6316,3273,1082,11,77433,3869,1208,96282,951,1879,288,11,11412,39587,23761,653,91116,5636,31914,580,1880,5636,32118,2727,15105,5019,3625,33013,4558,2396,1218,29410,13,34447,1913,54960,11,834,4791,72,11,3900,379,2665,275,45325,11,1880,14707,11,3900,7970,4978,11,3900,379,264,653,106954,11,3900,30870,713,11,35149,11,308,285,83097,11,31385,277,11,4864,312,1195,25134,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,8815,4999,198,6153,15884,5403,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,512,198,16,13,12362,264,2867,323,64694,6070,311,3118,872,5811,13,198,17,13,81200,3230,10507,323,94066,311,41468,872,3585,13,198,18,13,72030,36232,323,11939,369,872,8712,11,902,3727,433,810,23387,323,66343,13,198,19,13,9356,287,4754,5663,16774,323,10742,11,45296,3463,31514,323,18361,315,10778,39555,627,198,791,1193,13189,430,29034,757,505,7231,264,4832,5573,374,279,28961,1005,315,82048,447,532,13978,323,42887,4221,11,902,2643,539,387,61528,16365,477,33352,311,682,30994,13,4452,11,1521,9099,41859,656,539,12207,57160,279,8244,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,627,198,5618,5296,430,420,16865,374,3196,389,856,8830,315,279,36815,323,1253,13592,11911,389,3927,39555,323,13042,36576,13,128009],"total_duration":42955903189,"load_duration":159155,"prompt_eval_count":793,"prompt_eval_duration":3380224000,"eval_count":180,"eval_duration":39575101000}
