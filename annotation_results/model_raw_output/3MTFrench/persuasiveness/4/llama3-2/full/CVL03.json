{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T00:03:23.856445486Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasive power of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by:\n\n1. Establishing credibility: The speaker shares their personal experience and expertise in the field, which helps to establish trust with the audience.\n2. Providing specific examples: The speaker gives concrete examples of the effectiveness of the therapy protocol, including statistics about the reduction of symptoms.\n3. Appealing to emotions: The speaker highlights the emotional toll of trauma on children and emphasizes the importance of helping them cope with their experiences.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 1 point because:\n\n1. Lack of counterarguments: The speech does not address potential counterarguments or criticisms that might be raised about the therapy protocol.\n2. Overemphasis on statistics: While statistics can be persuasive, the speaker's focus on numbers may come across as too technical or detached from the human experience.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a strong case for the effectiveness of their therapy protocol, and their passion and commitment to helping children with PTSD are evident.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,3665,89,11,3900,379,264,653,9880,409,36959,68,11,272,96287,1208,2457,294,22827,11159,12267,3930,83977,1056,404,3675,13,64105,64,20272,220,23,8261,1744,1208,5837,7379,390,818,6316,6671,409,1709,67100,11,5636,409,220,2636,296,4618,46415,11,951,11990,841,16458,5512,1880,653,13026,88661,1143,3709,278,3395,481,1880,304,478,318,481,409,9781,372,3689,261,8841,2428,13,24703,934,54386,829,275,1370,45973,11,272,17771,1744,220,1490,4,294,6,40997,84440,82133,52895,716,951,35665,11540,12249,2132,288,1880,9908,1744,1208,7591,4099,11,409,326,6,1149,1291,24560,951,923,22155,11,6033,951,21965,409,8631,1772,442,266,2428,13,1952,25692,26725,665,296,41901,71751,409,29449,17536,23761,17302,978,3869,6316,81695,409,10237,13,19421,16578,3869,42067,51913,10610,1133,11,389,11412,68226,52895,716,85114,12104,9769,9004,1765,514,1317,45369,13,1952,11412,68226,594,25526,404,951,3611,17724,294,31769,652,978,5979,22589,13,1952,11412,68226,594,25526,404,653,27065,294,6,1354,978,2407,13109,15690,11,6316,281,14140,738,5048,13,1952,11412,20028,951,80181,1634,2922,6496,11,389,40142,951,8381,25082,13,65381,3846,4545,2922,6496,11,389,35737,9604,265,7010,21965,409,8631,1772,442,266,2428,13,6178,72,11,389,42775,273,409,270,4558,325,11,46152,6824,68,3869,38211,326,6,6581,292,582,13109,294,31109,98652,7317,391,332,2428,13,1952,11412,68226,75144,7010,294,6,475,288,26077,2317,68,27584,665,6671,409,1709,67100,13,19421,5019,68226,38211,20662,98652,11,20662,3057,1557,7317,391,332,2428,11,503,34155,34280,978,665,272,21336,653,12541,409,65827,3675,8841,1640,2428,11,7930,264,15925,26725,3625,49301,951,2960,33903,294,41901,69,1821,13,19421,389,28130,264,10045,978,665,21965,3284,305,39883,4714,332,2428,11,6316,76680,4714,579,294,58736,3571,11,9952,326,26248,579,294,22827,35030,292,2908,7930,274,53149,6853,514,83187,459,1286,66601,13,19421,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,6316,76680,4714,579,4754,8082,13,1708,1105,11,3613,81,4558,79507,11,4068,39043,513,39904,949,34447,272,17771,25945,4382,13,445,41901,61827,11412,96586,594,25526,265,13,1952,11412,25400,71751,20662,22337,978,3395,593,7930,1826,514,83187,459,1286,66601,13,356,17771,6316,22337,978,3395,593,389,74282,77422,25945,14707,13,1952,1208,2916,9486,26725,3625,49301,665,9822,11,7546,54960,73151,38469,13,19421,44829,389,11412,1208,74333,45347,220,1954,4520,514,27138,1744,1208,22337,978,3395,375,264,274,6,6581,295,13,33150,25646,409,27750,220,1954,4520,11,389,11412,390,1658,263,466,326,41901,61827,3869,4538,83187,9517,54961,442,266,2428,13,19421,272,17771,51625,285,42625,3869,3846,4545,2922,6496,409,326,31769,85,2328,3930,98395,99136,2428,11,934,54386,11412,9604,265,3930,35030,292,2908,7930,44829,325,85877,11252,1208,961,4046,49975,64829,11,7930,1826,4189,978,3869,42067,51913,10610,1133,934,35329,379,50590,7015,13,19421,39587,389,3567,14687,48416,8977,3625,12104,9769,9004,1772,442,266,8467,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,220,8258,60404,15132,1522,5512,7010,3846,1760,511,1286,11,15890,3625,60404,82133,23933,1435,2761,65220,41091,13,19421,389,264,3625,6954,59307,100246,597,1910,8467,13,5186,12416,6316,72709,11,6316,86806,72709,409,89714,11,389,264,6316,35916,11,6316,48416,1516,409,326,6,1149,72,39883,99136,2428,409,326,6,541,265,409,220,5728,14697,19421,55398,81991,220,18,46415,42138,1208,1913,3930,1760,511,1286,13,64105,64,11,39043,17317,29557,60019,409,17317,13510,934,54386,264,6033,1653,951,44585,5615,45632,1880,7477,295,8467,11,934,54386,11412,68226,75144,5019,550,5615,466,3846,12544,409,8631,1772,442,266,2428,7010,326,6,475,685,409,326,6,2910,10515,4090,1880,961,412,3869,30517,514,38900,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,66343,2410,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,512,198,16,13,40498,287,38769,25,578,19114,13551,872,4443,3217,323,19248,304,279,2115,11,902,8779,311,5813,7095,449,279,10877,13,198,17,13,81200,3230,10507,25,578,19114,6835,14509,10507,315,279,27375,315,279,15419,11766,11,2737,13443,922,279,14278,315,13803,13,198,18,13,29154,6260,311,21958,25,578,19114,22020,279,14604,26936,315,30988,389,2911,323,66159,279,12939,315,10695,1124,37586,449,872,11704,627,198,11458,11,358,1053,37910,220,16,1486,1606,512,198,16,13,68502,315,5663,16774,25,578,8982,1587,539,2686,4754,5663,16774,477,63836,430,2643,387,9408,922,279,15419,11766,13,198,17,13,6193,87292,389,13443,25,6104,134
