{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T01:33:16.186141613Z","response":"**Scale:** 1-5\n**Dimension:** Persuasiveness of the speech (effectiveness of crafting a convincing message, rigor of reasoning)\n\n**Score:** 4/5\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using a relatable scenario to introduce their research topic. They demonstrate a good understanding of the issue and provide some context about the importance of water treatment. The use of simple analogies (e.g., comparing an emulsion to vinaigrette) helps to make the technical concept more accessible.\n\nThe reasoning is generally rigorous, with a clear structure and logical flow. However, there are moments where the speaker seems to assume that their audience has prior knowledge about certain scientific concepts (e.g., thermodinamique). Additionally, the speech could benefit from a stronger conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the significance of their research.\n\nOverall, while not perfect, the speech is well-organized and engaging, making it an effective public performance.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,18434,519,75804,88253,7010,653,38900,39723,1208,2869,38469,1826,95529,81,5512,6960,13,80905,514,47929,1826,15987,4669,514,22234,1744,9189,47592,7010,15265,3273,1557,13,41621,45366,48908,55398,81991,326,49455,265,25646,3930,38900,665,71686,45889,76145,1370,1860,290,1880,389,1370,273,27584,293,1188,35657,294,6,14283,1765,21725,13,38891,89,11,653,45640,3869,30517,326,77025,1330,5019,48908,57625,1565,514,2092,294,31109,88026,35597,304,30992,15171,13,61651,14707,41091,11,4864,841,42775,273,6502,3930,16968,39015,21273,355,13,8242,79071,14896,409,5636,7317,66749,11,389,25692,13510,11,514,89714,409,326,93847,13,19421,97507,11,1841,326,93847,1826,64284,13,41621,665,1615,316,83256,95917,359,11,45441,220,1041,220,931,89016,1370,459,13,19421,39015,11,1208,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,11,272,17771,11,4068,1826,54312,934,35329,82133,20028,3625,23112,6863,2142,665,653,459,1765,21725,30,81501,3625,65838,409,45640,5019,39929,409,326,93847,13,61651,14707,11,77818,43765,5019,84440,11,3900,29253,951,14645,7930,29557,73468,409,1421,10993,326,93847,11,6033,379,264,27584,20662,7591,998,982,40936,5019,934,35329,44829,325,712,556,45575,779,333,13,1952,264,14707,23423,978,1765,88026,3869,75144,3625,123299,9004,14645,11,10071,514,5945,5979,272,17771,934,54386,1826,653,28800,5636,81786,1880,934,54386,20272,653,28800,40970,294,6,306,408,554,29449,1615,20372,367,294,93847,13,4366,1615,978,17187,11,3846,87264,48488,21965,23008,1880,390,316,81235,4046,39624,10515,81235,409,1421,10993,43905,326,93847,934,54386,69152,13,2009,26600,285,7930,43989,100162,11,272,17771,409,18027,261,326,93847,7010,1208,84921,3930,3284,33670,409,1208,78467,1430,7010,326,41901,2842,40280,13,19421,272,17771,1208,16968,326,6,853,84,409,1208,38317,1765,514,89714,294,93847,1880,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,50501,1851,79,8047,409,80080,14645,7930,29557,73468,294,49152,13603,6316,94721,60128,294,93847,16968,665,2800,519,82653,1133,13,6178,72,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,665,54008,1291,11,272,17771,6316,14240,2070,3930,89714,11,1208,19266,36235,951,7625,919,3930,305,3159,294,41901,66876,13,39783,4046,76,34003,11,272,17771,16968,71357,514,296,19010,853,409,26633,12046,3422,17317,296,6,20243,1748,13,1252,28800,22299,25400,11,514,348,2259,343,265,1744,9189,296,19010,853,89,33670,294,6,395,40366,4538,4046,3415,49834,4371,1037,13,16233,1739,1744,41091,11083,4046,76,20813,84568,15132,653,28800,40970,33818,8467,13,7695,274,6,74972,409,342,412,2392,294,6,17156,458,41569,2428,32118,5317,978,3869,409,326,93847,11,3900,7937,409,78467,1430,67965,6853,13,27058,19266,62219,27750,4046,76,20813,11,3900,379,264,6316,6425,14707,4382,7930,17317,1826,6587,8047,1370,6316,8198,76190,8047,1208,9139,2658,258,309,2428,13,79873,265,13,12095,4864,841,18728,2192,55455,11,7138,75,1001,11,3625,26633,40321,5512,82133,513,19266,62219,13,2009,5945,5979,11,272,17771,934,35329,11412,20028,1744,503,6,1617,1438,1317,67380,11,51854,49301,11,51854,5347,33903,11,11412,27584,35597,5636,13,38891,89,514,8286,934,35329,2267,664,14687,5019,5708,261,40744,3625,7625,919,665,65022,934,80720,513,19266,62219,13,27058,4043,1155,326,39982,14081,8047,16968,39043,11,4864,91507,75144,6316,2869,38469,7930,15572,68,1765,514,27584,82660,3527,934,22827,1488,10367,13,39783,39654,7930,264,1208,21744,39883,409,312,2002,404,326,6,17156,458,41569,2428,1880,409,1208,74333,45347,326,93847,13,19421,514,5945,5979,11,272,17771,1744,22299,26725,3625,1488,45632,8065,25646,294,22827,4545,11,7643,39654,264,348,395,306,293,3102,978,13,7695,2267,664,969,45575,409,5636,665,5636,294,31769,64374,5019,5088,268,404,1208,76038,13,19421,272,17771,409,39015,1744,503,55624,651,1188,13,3341,4864,296,6,14310,86577,409,48021,665,99225,61480,6316,2869,38469,7930,29557,25945,1744,3625,78957,513,293,3102,306,40970,83457,13,27058,45602,11,4864,91507,9189,13510,11,7591,20672,6316,4020,1557,6144,23994,409,20622,354,51725,409,1841,20337,7930,6348,64,22011,1370,951,8162,12,2159,288,13,1952,1208,21744,39883,294,6,3342,5615,9211,1208,12454,2987,3930,1208,7479,409,1208,39654,13,1611,80444,11,27549,513,30870,1557,40970,83457,13,19421,39587,11,389,44829,325,51791,261,326,93847,409,85722,5636,82653,2428,13,33150,40970,11,4864,91507,23761,665,14240,266,9952,9189,13,356,17771,6502,9952,39043,1744,4864,91507,9517,65272,1215,514,89714,409,326,49455,519,829,3728,13109,13,34447,3900,11412,6044,8977,3869,4538,82620,13,1952,90096,519,653,46110,28800,3869,326,6,15433,22660,13,19421,665,3846,4545,11,7010,514,38900,11,3900,379,264,84871,294,81979,52571,1759,7930,11,22299,41091,11,58673,484,306,1765,3625,46106,4046,74199,332,5512,13,4366,346,1744,21725,1826,14707,11,10071,3900,2267,664,969,13550,978,71,3981,4538,1208,88026,13,33150,40970,11,272,17771,5019,4068,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,
