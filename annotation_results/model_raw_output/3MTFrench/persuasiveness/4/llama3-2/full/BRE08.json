{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T00:51:37.100233971Z","response":"What a unique transcript!\n\nTo evaluate the persuasiveness of this speech, I'll consider the following aspects:\n\n1. **Rigorous reasoning**: The speaker presents a thoughtful analogy between paté and foie gras, which is an interesting way to illustrate their point about the role of authorities in international development. They also provide some historical context, mentioning the recognition of local authorities' importance by the United States in 2005.\n2. **Credibility**: The speaker appears to be knowledgeable about the topic, citing a specific book (Mattess) and using technical terms like \"mergouvé\" (which I had to look up). Their delivery is also confident and enthusiastic.\n3. **Emotional connection**: While the speech doesn't have a traditional emotional appeal, the speaker's passion for their subject matter is palpable. They use rhetorical devices like repetition (\"l'amère de la fiction...\") and exclamations (\"Près que c'est bon que des viettes!\") to engage the audience.\n4. **Organization**: The speech has a clear structure: introduction, main points, and conclusion. The speaker transitions smoothly between ideas.\n\nBased on these factors, I'd give this speech a score of 4 out of 5 (SCALE). While it's not perfect, the speaker effectively crafts a convincing message that is engaging and well-organized.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,84276,11,4635,2852,53070,45325,514,6033,326,58591,12339,409,15265,79245,949,14465,9189,22114,16968,11,39043,13085,89,514,6033,326,58591,12339,409,15265,79245,3869,326,31769,61492,8047,11,834,519,8065,89802,409,1208,51223,9780,37526,13,62293,16968,514,5201,1744,4864,9189,21559,11,272,17771,514,89802,11,326,31769,5481,593,409,326,26248,579,82620,304,978,59728,580,1880,304,89171,978,274,17771,10415,8047,13,11876,27865,35933,53397,2109,1466,77,306,326,58591,12339,409,1208,17422,9189,757,13510,74466,11,1880,14707,665,220,679,20,11,653,52571,324,1097,39965,467,586,264,653,56984,528,275,360,978,1880,274,35329,1826,18970,283,52274,653,33013,42625,13,4702,1133,11,5088,24201,60172,1765,3625,63922,668,294,52152,41116,7930,56311,48021,9465,84440,11,326,6,27887,68238,1880,951,27865,35933,53397,951,326,6,269,14295,951,38682,919,11,951,1081,8699,951,76235,3808,1880,27584,951,36252,897,7298,65735,3846,409,9822,7010,326,26248,579,8065,82620,13,14465,296,55624,978,22550,5636,11951,10253,27865,35933,53397,409,94527,10398,283,1441,513,55467,11,3930,6800,10398,283,1441,513,55467,11,66021,934,41901,20272,11,46152,15132,54008,67882,1180,1924,665,326,58591,11067,13,19421,503,34155,326,6,1617,1815,409,7591,23827,261,49733,326,62595,4253,1697,8082,409,27750,1180,38647,1353,12249,44521,1339,45889,28800,18713,9225,5512,514,1647,454,1286,538,2428,409,326,6,27887,68238,7010,3625,8106,288,19227,645,1744,326,26248,579,409,82620,13,41621,9189,7631,10333,25692,85815,11,10071,934,17771,3846,1744,39043,2349,1744,3846,45441,326,6,27887,68238,6033,3625,27865,35933,53397,7930,945,79738,949,7695,86100,10415,261,47289,97495,6316,38920,24291,648,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,514,3352,978,1880,514,12018,648,50087,13,14465,9189,3327,2428,13,7695,47090,6669,10670,1208,1156,48099,2655,38135,22299,653,41840,409,12018,648,50087,13,19421,65735,3625,76680,2490,3682,275,17724,951,4398,2655,367,3916,11,3846,41840,513,9517,884,981,978,294,22827,81336,15433,1188,11,5016,1880,45441,834,519,11,2098,10670,326,6,27887,68238,13,4275,87264,54312,934,22827,1879,96559,934,31109,27865,13109,53397,87264,63828,13178,547,5019,3488,1215,6316,79036,2655,38135,409,326,6,27887,68238,949,356,17771,83195,326,31769,447,12031,3930,60014,100063,733,60768,11,22299,8065,21901,409,514,3352,978,1880,514,12018,648,50087,13,27058,61512,11,41199,514,65385,951,65838,220,777,1490,11,951,27865,35933,53397,296,109960,306,951,6299,294,6,329,978,76931,1880,1370,28130,88411,11,1880,28130,1367,87453,552,84568,513,15132,737,981,14014,22299,951,1180,38647,63828,13178,1769,409,27750,82620,13,33150,1486,27584,42676,220,1049,20,11,3625,7140,83345,285,16456,3458,22144,1188,28130,436,57332,22299,15131,20487,5019,93381,71933,3625,1665,22589,3930,2606,978,29583,5019,514,82620,13,362,32384,11,13678,478,274,6,1354,38096,7010,653,3488,52985,48488,5636,3544,409,3846,1744,17317,26725,43306,2439,409,1208,85182,77,685,62940,20487,1880,27584,1208,85182,77,685,409,12155,21935,13,8242,3900,379,665,264,2515,91640,81621,7010,6316,45455,4558,325,409,3352,978,13,65381,326,78337,294,31109,21797,13109,294,6,533,38647,11,17317,44521,919,1120,1133,39587,294,31109,21797,13109,294,22827,6800,3675,15878,5019,3154,519,665,41518,265,60128,1880,665,733,60768,13,19421,3930,7970,3352,978,11,4864,94297,9189,13510,11,503,41901,16796,51296,978,13,2394,12416,1744,272,17771,7970,1744,951,3355,47003,13,1708,1105,11,5019,47929,4502,326,6,27887,68238,66167,514,48021,653,10484,13109,357,978,3930,38900,11,66651,45325,3869,7643,65827,10431,7010,653,459,13,25145,72,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,5016,36815,4999,198,1271,15806,279,24613,300,13071,315,420,8982,11,358,3358,2980,279,2768,13878,512,198,16,13,3146,49,343,20857,33811,96618,578,19114,18911,264,43766,56203,1990,3352,978,323,12018,648,50087,11,902,374,459,7185,1648,311,41468,872,1486,922,279,3560,315,11527,304,6625,4500,13,2435,1101,3493,1063,13970,2317,11,45391,279,18324,315,2254,11527,6,12939,555,279,3723,4273,304,220,1049,20,13,198,17,13,3146,34,1171,3225,96618,578,19114,8111,311,387,42066,922,279,8712,11,33264,264,3230,2363,320,40917,434,8,323,1701,11156,3878,1093,330,1195,70,283,52274,1,320,8370,358,1047,311,1427,709,570,11205,9889,374,1101,16913,323,42702,13,198,18,13,3146,2321,41964,3717,96618,6104,279,8982,3250,956,617,264,8776,14604,14638,11,279,19114,596,11939,369,872,3917,5030,374,75649,481,13,2435,1005,87068,7766,1093
