Is their reasoning rigorous?)\n\n**SCALE:** 1-5 (not at all to very much)\n\nAfter analyzing the transcript, I would give the following score:\n\n**TASK:** 4\n\nThe speaker presents a compelling argument by using a relatable analogy (comparing molecular biology to finding someone in a cathedral) and explaining complex concepts in simple terms. They also highlight the importance of their research and its potential impact on society.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give it a perfect score (5) because there are moments where the speaker's enthusiasm and passion for their work might come across as slightly over-the-top or overly technical, which could potentially alienate some listeners.\n\nOverall, the speech is well-structured, engaging, and effectively conveys the importance of the researcher's work.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,45325,665,5542,409,15765,8646,1208,2035,409,1208,31747,15433,46140,11,653,274,93006,42138,1474,12558,409,6216,288,13,41621,379,264,716,346,424,10333,951,2960,33903,409,48577,11,16968,409,96642,13,24703,7591,91312,665,27584,27138,7010,43905,653,52314,409,18445,13,39783,45165,23349,1448,10610,5512,648,13,19421,14707,11,7216,89,45325,934,31109,2849,1130,11,272,17771,24068,321,13,7695,379,264,5636,665,296,3675,8065,22337,978,3395,11,96642,7930,513,7591,501,18680,665,27584,27138,7010,951,18445,4244,388,13,43987,26178,11,4502,389,54606,818,3869,1208,31747,15433,46140,11,1880,1744,4864,9189,62163,409,46524,100198,1647,8941,8137,1989,7930,513,71451,39015,11,39043,10025,593,409,9189,59394,48488,409,27138,13,350,6,5164,1969,1744,9189,10025,16339,74466,409,841,6502,514,46524,13,4366,45973,11,4502,503,34155,52579,1208,27389,936,1516,294,6,64316,653,74672,22761,569,1765,1208,83067,409,342,14081,569,11,9189,12584,89,68226,514,2109,52424,25945,100198,13,19421,27584,514,46932,519,45369,3930,27138,13,41621,5019,23577,46131,39723,3900,11412,11,42676,389,1826,1880,4068,13,19421,14707,11,1120,1133,11,1647,42775,6824,68,3869,75831,653,74672,22761,569,13,34447,22337,978,3395,12267,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,6316,22337,978,3395,65,1640,2428,11,22299,389,665,71451,7010,1208,2849,1130,11,10071,7930,27549,87264,13171,409,282,747,15171,15907,13,12095,4864,25400,326,34155,326,39982,3159,11,9952,6316,41263,20712,294,31109,3738,68,76651,11,27549,3567,14687,39587,665,4046,3455,1880,48021,6316,41263,20712,13,34447,294,31109,47838,76651,13,2009,719,409,3846,74672,22761,569,87264,39587,409,68226,8657,13391,416,1133,6316,22337,978,3395,65,11,8065,19910,409,1208,91653,483,1448,10610,2852,648,11,272,17771,326,39982,360,12339,13,3341,97507,11,3738,288,294,6,24677,6341,2278,4558,55923,653,436,57332,21901,44186,13,12095,84568,15132,60014,85,22626,842,299,1220,6033,60014,85,22626,14269,11,21965,81786,6033,1522,14014,11,45602,25692,39929,951,1615,978,45045,13859,266,8467,13,4702,68,934,81991,1370,51173,2211,882,1208,10237,409,1208,2849,1130,11,6033,514,82620,294,31109,8811,329,648,13,34447,4068,11,75804,88253,11,4864,66517,5019,64290,404,3846,74672,22761,569,22337,978,3395,12267,13,19421,14707,11,503,34155,86595,978,653,326,2117,74672,519,13,7695,47090,6669,10670,46777,7970,99077,259,8047,11,22299,14240,519,326,6,408,8047,40321,5048,409,1208,22337,978,3395,375,13,19421,39587,46777,22337,978,3395,375,2322,61512,6316,951,3698,2259,19941,2278,21041,3930,326,2117,13,14465,51441,294,6,306,583,1565,1370,8318,27750,11990,409,67239,5512,11,514,6033,326,41901,2470,1880,95256,3326,263,11,73103,7930,282,77065,3869,3846,13,1708,1105,11,3154,519,9189,13510,1744,259,17771,3869,1208,1925,11,6316,1370,2957,27750,11990,409,22337,978,3395,20975,11,272,17771,9131,12266,13,356,17771,5019,39043,1744,7010,326,31769,61673,11,389,69152,1208,8162,2269,839,2428,665,342,412,10010,13,62408,2869,38469,11,27549,757,29557,409,296,6,625,1598,12329,16968,665,9511,67763,13,65381,1208,2035,294,49963,12329,951,34083,11,503,49963,1082,951,98385,733,30872,2641,1206,988,409,45889,10532,337,3695,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,11,294,59858,12018,648,5636,38920,934,22827,6800,274,481,13,19421,3869,1208,2035,294,49963,12329,951,24547,47003,6033,951,20547,288,97262,8839,29005,4282,11,503,49963,1082,6316,8162,2320,17194,5019,4846,3625,733,30872,2641,1206,988,1880,3625,8678,805,13,921,20234,733,60768,11412,2018,8977,6316,22337,978,3395,375,13,19421,77433,3869,653,8162,1355,2474,11,4046,61673,1880,7010,1208,1167,12267,11,1880,7010,653,6141,3357,324,1744,4864,11715,1295,11,4864,94297,8678,805,1208,23878,13109,409,97332,409,220,3101,22337,20243,2482,96642,46777,513,95959,13,19421,27584,11,4864,5019,41098,79196,52424,73103,7930,282,77065,3869,3846,13,34447,11,1647,42775,841,274,6,1138,37093,6502,39015,1773,291,598,13,445,6,434,768,3930,52571,324,274,17771,409,60946,265,13,19421,5019,41091,11,272,17771,3869,342,59858,409,60946,265,87320,3625,22337,20243,2482,79196,14081,14014,15132,2107,4893,409,51881,66,14014,13,1708,1105,1744,3625,46106,308,7085,13,27058,39043,11,503,6,49921,1082,28130,18528,13,19421,5019,64290,404,3625,22337,20243,2482,3625,5636,18041,15844,2278,21041,11,503,6,26577,648,27584,409,3625,1097,73511,15171,665,3625,1437,27561,15844,13,4366,51173,11,665,2035,665,40321,519,11,1370,653,47838,13,80905,39043,11,7010,514,2766,294,49455,263,404,11,514,342,2534,2269,74960,8065,326,31769,3395,12267,409,2486,467,13,62408,8791,458,11,7930,11,4864,326,6,25632,12339,11,11412,29557,10367,3869,84871,294,81979,52571,1759,409,64972,22842,13,19421,39587,64972,60946,265,326,6,9011,2727,22337,20243,2482,7930,513,14240,664,1188,13,1252,28800,22299,4502,4864,28130,21559,514,7970,342,2534,2269,74960,5019,2109,52424,326,6,472,342,14081,569,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,
