Starting with an attention-grabbing fact that sparks curiosity and sets the tone for the rest of the talk.\n2. Providing concrete examples and analogies to illustrate complex concepts, making them easier to understand.\n3. Showing enthusiasm and passion for the topic, which is infectious and engaging.\n4. Using a clear and logical structure to build an argument, starting with the problem, then presenting potential solutions, and finally highlighting the benefits of their approach.\n\nHowever, I would deduct one point because the speech could benefit from more concrete data or evidence to support some of the claims made. For example, while the speaker mentions that they found a correlation between the activity and symptoms, it would be helpful to see specific numbers or statistics to back up this claim.\n\nOverall, the speaker does an excellent job of crafting a compelling narrative and presenting their ideas in a clear and concise manner.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,64105,64,33614,1744,15265,272,5976,2933,34501,818,1370,514,293,57567,409,326,31769,47262,13109,13,29124,588,484,978,11,15265,272,5976,2933,25692,453,318,1992,7010,220,16,11,914,305,13,356,8458,92215,23761,6316,9517,52274,2354,5019,3625,91329,16549,288,11,10071,5019,1647,29005,2727,409,60120,18247,56447,333,8467,11,326,6,1735,333,1826,16968,47838,13,97148,261,9952,20662,4046,47262,13109,5019,46524,951,7317,391,552,9721,15844,13,4366,51173,11,5019,9517,998,72540,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,5019,18027,261,76076,951,28405,5247,19266,265,4749,2249,13,507,2005,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,41959,19266,265,42743,2848,17675,13,62463,12936,7607,6824,68,665,326,6,6517,519,367,409,26633,98151,299,5919,3869,326,55624,57663,3930,272,5976,2933,7930,11412,96586,4667,261,653,8045,10733,7930,11412,96586,12936,8646,4046,47262,1133,665,16513,514,272,5976,2933,13,1252,28800,22299,653,1798,266,11,220,508,13615,13,5019,514,1080,12844,13,62408,15105,1826,10045,8047,81186,46206,11939,93381,46429,409,1208,8811,329,648,409,62145,5019,514,1080,12844,11,514,89714,35030,52777,324,11,2605,61652,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,13,507,2005,11,39723,3625,98151,28787,2142,11,272,17771,294,31109,294,6,13885,1572,409,8198,17422,11,10071,3846,308,17771,6502,951,11148,1220,409,10025,593,13,5186,12416,45889,65838,11,20662,41959,2605,61652,44767,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,22299,951,26483,2396,409,1208,15572,68,6033,409,326,31769,447,31059,265,13,5034,41959,665,16513,11,46206,3625,6978,1370,649,325,773,818,11,308,17771,6502,10737,978,3869,28130,99568,3675,13,362,64160,409,7809,57288,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,9189,29465,5741,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,9189,29465,5741,11,665,16513,11,3869,274,6,306,11588,68,934,35329,17317,2322,2221,556,1765,653,2700,62868,1413,409,6149,13,2998,4725,11,9189,12584,89,917,8023,15265,348,87960,8065,955,409,6149,1880,3869,1208,6149,665,1194,978,13,4366,86633,11,1880,3869,1208,6149,665,1194,978,11,5019,51913,2058,27750,46838,351,43711,1392,11,3900,2267,664,14687,46524,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,272,1260,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,7695,2267,664,14687,1744,1208,41959,45441,51625,1082,1880,934,80720,45441,4642,7010,653,12025,547,13,14465,91507,312,59976,265,11083,1560,652,1220,13,7695,47090,46524,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,272,1260,13,622,34155,665,49564,978,326,6,9035,13109,98151,34395,46206,220,4370,6978,7010,6316,88100,14707,51625,1082,11,7930,1826,514,912,88,2933,65827,17243,2428,13,14465,757,36731,92759,978,3869,51854,1719,75104,409,20662,4197,13109,13,5034,1448,978,4474,1826,1208,18757,24918,5019,95917,359,409,27750,6978,13,14465,91507,9189,390,1658,977,3869,51854,32116,13,2876,64656,11,1208,1448,978,4474,1880,1208,18757,24918,97958,25945,7482,46206,27750,6978,13,622,34155,824,5979,978,5553,42844,56321,8261,1880,503,34155,100162,1744,326,6,9035,13109,43989,908,978,8065,12104,99757,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,13,19421,272,17771,6316,22710,265,7930,11412,29557,10367,409,75831,6316,41959,97252,35965,8047,7010,653,18111,324,463,1557,5019,3625,6978,7930,82133,29557,10367,3846,7930,82133,68226,513,5534,7420,3869,25400,13,65381,6316,348,87960,10737,8047,1765,514,7364,3930,7970,383,324,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,512,198,16,13,28757,449,459,6666,25313,370,7278,2144,430,76883,41328,323,7437,279,16630,369,279,2800,315,279,3137,13,198,17,13,81200,14509,10507,323,24291,552,311,41468,6485,19476,11,3339,1124,8831,311,3619,13,198,18,13,72030,36232,323,11939,369,279,8712,11,902,374,50600,323,23387,13,198,19,13,12362,264,2867,323,20406,6070,311,1977,459,5811,11,6041,449,279,3575,11,1243,32644,4754,10105,11,323,5616,39686,279,7720,315,872,5603,627,198,11458,11,358,1053,37910,832,1486,1606,279,8982,1436,8935,505,810,14509,828,477,6029,311,1862,1063,315,279,8349,1903,13,1789,3187,11,1418,279,19114,34945,430,814,1766,264,26670,1990,279,5820,323,13803,11,433,1053,387,11190,311,1518,3230,5219,477,13443,311,1203,709,420,3802,627,198,28589,11,279,19114,1587,459,9250,2683,315,45167,264,29722,19775,323,32644,872,6848,304,264,2867,323,64694,11827,13,128009],"total_duration":48904640739,"load_duration":158386,"prompt_eval_count":767,"prompt_eval_duration":3157203000,"eval_count":208,"eval_duration":45746829000}
