{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T22:52:21.177288765Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by sharing personal anecdotes and experiences that illustrate their passion for archaeology and the importance of studying the past. The use of rhetorical devices such as metaphors (\"le c≈ìur de ma recherche\") and vivid imagery (\"les escalettes que j'ai dit\") adds depth and emotion to the speech, making it more engaging and memorable.\n\nThe speaker also uses logical reasoning and scientific explanations to justify their research and its significance, which helps to build credibility and trust with the audience. Additionally, the speaker's use of humor and self-deprecation (\"Je n'ai pas vraiment d'offre des emplois vous proposer\") adds a human touch and makes the speech more relatable.\n\nHowever, the speech could be improved by providing more concrete evidence or data to support their claims and arguments, as well as addressing potential counterarguments or criticisms of their research. Overall, the speaker's persuasive abilities are strong, but there is room for refinement and development.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,2564,3489,438,503,49152,2852,15925,514,27138,11,503,34155,59148,1653,326,6,1132,978,5673,648,13,423,6,370,541,11,9952,326,6,19010,535,11,3625,9477,958,472,14014,13,19421,44829,11,653,9880,11,503,34155,5293,978,3869,1647,21134,44453,1291,409,57625,4618,11,6316,34923,648,9517,52274,2354,409,1208,503,44886,26248,15925,934,22827,887,8047,665,83067,409,96586,5438,83391,41416,1640,1157,13,2009,76305,17194,7930,1826,3930,7591,631,11,1208,6671,3930,81621,11,264,31632,409,3846,1744,326,93825,38831,66867,8047,409,57625,4618,5438,978,848,2428,13,3489,438,503,6,6292,552,648,513,2322,83,11,389,20272,3663,3869,45889,37539,811,13,44564,45740,2530,1826,409,10430,9952,951,47104,71151,14707,11,10071,951,47104,304,47391,1441,5019,29449,264,43406,1880,7930,16006,306,409,17317,4046,70,5741,5553,294,81979,83229,86709,13,11583,31025,484,31539,294,6,25280,8065,4631,73899,11,1370,51173,11,272,17771,653,96839,39723,3900,379,264,28800,409,7591,65,3102,978,1880,3900,47090,20028,409,326,54386,9189,14240,799,11,409,326,54386,9189,14240,799,11,97507,13,19421,409,326,54386,9880,45347,8065,9511,67763,3869,3460,404,3625,1400,4558,2392,951,447,37907,934,35329,1826,27389,13570,3930,27138,7930,39904,13,921,20234,25661,10010,11,40351,11,18694,11,33632,519,11,1826,653,23496,84,11,6316,54613,9952,4538,348,20243,84,1880,15907,357,343,16862,13,622,34155,9964,22011,43153,46106,1880,76776,11,43153,75559,7930,56311,1370,86633,296,6,485,72684,1208,30179,768,294,31109,8811,329,648,4225,2635,31037,54008,20712,13,19421,409,3846,1486,409,76235,11,7930,326,6,485,65023,84,11,503,34155,9964,22011,76826,1208,9517,42098,409,27750,8811,17491,11,3869,326,31769,331,6853,951,6732,5438,978,848,8467,1880,409,43153,22673,13,2009,1080,12844,409,7643,38317,11,272,17771,409,259,1992,294,17771,1826,3212,1208,961,1744,71925,6960,27750,30020,7010,3625,52088,66474,409,77323,951,22673,459,5979,15564,13,23262,3675,11,1370,51173,11,294,6,485,65023,84,3869,27138,409,274,59858,1488,15760,11,46206,3625,6216,1900,409,1208,9517,65272,93424,11,653,44351,11,39723,326,6,292,8047,1880,1647,2848,24201,324,7546,1604,274,59858,3276,52760,3091,424,546,1826,11,10071,259,77025,60019,6502,5804,467,20811,13,19421,9964,834,3625,10237,82,11,934,35329,379,107902,951,10237,82,11,10071,4864,308,34155,6502,60019,6316,8198,4839,68,13,2998,20272,11,3846,15132,951,36788,7930,58673,484,306,409,21497,288,11,1841,1370,86633,11,1880,9964,834,1744,326,26248,579,308,17771,6502,8657,285,519,13,1708,1105,11,76076,49301,11,503,41901,56127,326,31109,97045,1880,951,342,1821,13,19421,4864,52571,3625,4294,4893,409,27750,8811,17491,4225,2635,1924,13,24703,15132,3625,17188,6033,3625,293,533,28154,14295,11,3869,31632,409,27389,3532,1133,11,409,86696,8508,9004,665,35130,13,622,6,434,61055,409,85877,440,261,326,6,1846,45,409,27750,80727,13,356,17771,3869,13510,1208,11917,78422,99188,409,1208,30179,768,409,27750,80727,7010,3625,1560,936,66692,1744,503,34155,22011,13,9424,688,11,4864,66517,523,283,2067,519,13,34447,1208,9517,5807,1137,11,272,17771,7010,1208,44229,20712,20028,89504,3625,10237,82,13,24703,523,283,295,978,841,513,1589,8047,3869,326,6,461,4618,13,356,17771,409,1370,43406,3869,15907,25912,11,71686,77433,3869,28130,34922,11,272,17771,934,35329,17317,15473,46452,409,28130,17536,81621,13,19421,97507,11,46152,15132,14707,5636,293,402,2402,7930,908,306,9952,13,423,944,20712,11,272,17771,46110,5803,266,11,10071,934,54386,274,17771,12694,6502,326,6,97675,13,24971,25945,7706,17194,13,356,17771,653,96839,19227,1001,27389,936,556,1880,4864,308,34155,6502,60019,294,6,1885,265,951,8654,385,285,9189,10045,261,13,362,424,64,1814,26725,27750,84228,14295,934,54386,28130,961,409,45165,1018,978,11,10071,326,6,434,306,13327,308,17771,6502,514,80410,409,513,28605,46777,5634,258,5019,20028,653,42775,7930,17317,11939,818,7930,17317,14464,306,1841,11,42138,16968,11,934,22827,60172,11,1208,9284,11,272,17771,514,88768,11,46110,42463,13,25145,72,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,11821,4443,94066,323,11704,430,41468,872,11939,369,39211,2508,323,279,12939,315,21630,279,3347,13,578,1005,315,87068,7766,1778,439,31768,1105,3573,273,272,89412,409,7643,38317,909,323,43120,41545,3573,645,1560,936,66692,1744,503,34155,22011,909,11621,8149,323,20356,311,279,
