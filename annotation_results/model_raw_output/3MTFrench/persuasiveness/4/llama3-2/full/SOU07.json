{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T00:18:03.932643439Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by:\n\n1. Starting with a relatable example (grippe and rume) to engage the audience.\n2. Explaining complex concepts (biomarkers, genetics) in simple terms, making them accessible to non-experts.\n3. Providing specific examples (identification of biomarkers in moche, comparison between patients and healthy individuals) to illustrate their point.\n4. Showing enthusiasm and passion for their research, which is contagious and makes the audience more receptive to their message.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the speaker's argument relies heavily on assumed expertise (e.g., \"we all know the symptoms of en rume\"). While this may be true in certain contexts, not everyone in the audience may have prior knowledge or experience with these topics. To make the message more persuasive and inclusive, the speaker could provide more context or explanations to help listeners understand the underlying concepts.\n\nOverall, I think the speaker does a great job of presenting their ideas in an engaging and clear manner, making it easy for the audience to follow along and be convinced by their argument.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,356,17771,1208,80091,409,1208,25703,375,1880,951,436,3972,13,9589,54312,934,35329,379,264,951,47104,653,436,3972,1880,7010,1208,71632,30,9580,3869,41091,13,507,2005,11,97507,11,97507,13,356,96287,6502,3930,282,411,321,409,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,13,1952,74282,77422,26725,3625,12104,9769,9004,294,41901,436,3972,13,452,26248,326,31109,301,7930,4020,273,665,1097,1604,3869,1208,83067,13,19421,389,513,3288,6502,25945,665,57128,13,43987,26178,11,13085,89,1744,9189,47592,21965,409,1080,60244,12339,7010,514,29340,13,38891,89,13,356,17771,6502,4046,1325,306,13,1952,841,25692,6502,60019,47929,13,7695,47090,48908,46131,653,32118,4919,2727,20028,409,51309,29340,598,13,445,6496,11,7010,29449,29340,11,514,32118,4919,2727,25692,85877,440,261,1208,22337,20243,495,68,409,1080,60244,12339,13,19421,17317,13510,11,3869,6666,11,9189,665,47592,21965,13,41621,10025,42221,951,5945,79155,1841,4298,2249,44496,3395,5518,13,12095,8791,458,409,68226,85877,440,261,951,22337,20243,2482,71269,333,8467,7010,29449,29340,11,7591,8385,729,75467,324,11,7930,17317,1280,2428,1208,30179,768,6033,326,6,370,77467,978,294,31109,8811,329,648,13,64105,64,29557,294,6,20311,29449,3941,409,17536,11,409,59394,951,35030,292,24469,13,1952,308,26248,6502,5019,40744,3625,8811,17491,13,4366,51173,11,1208,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,11,75804,88253,11,5019,1208,1891,8372,72684,11,3900,47090,20028,951,7177,60538,2436,13,3959,98385,5935,82,409,30276,13,34447,389,841,25692,6502,7631,261,653,33632,519,409,56321,8261,409,20028,951,5935,82,409,30276,13,1708,1105,11,8065,20272,11,951,7177,78422,10515,8467,13,34447,3625,7177,78422,10515,8467,11,16968,3846,934,35329,841,22011,11,272,17771,11,4502,3900,379,264,11,8065,6502,11,6316,27472,934,35329,2107,548,13,7695,841,834,6502,4502,20662,27472,5353,1208,8811,329,648,13,1611,5636,11,3900,1080,30872,668,23008,13,46706,7643,83067,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,1120,1133,653,76057,501,52760,409,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,13,5034,27472,294,22827,1167,5055,15207,8657,275,5019,2211,882,20662,8811,329,648,11,7930,15119,1557,3625,53542,1880,7930,274,53149,6853,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,11,2536,22013,442,2428,13,11842,22013,442,2428,11,39043,76605,13510,1744,3625,12104,9769,9004,56311,2961,1553,7010,8893,3869,326,49455,265,11,3846,7930,1826,17634,84,514,15439,77411,13,2009,1486,4068,66167,934,85217,14848,26725,951,23878,35933,17108,65832,48416,84,5512,11,46152,14848,3930,8811,9952,951,7177,409,1208,17536,409,26725,3625,49301,11,22299,78551,1880,75831,3869,326,6,1334,20272,513,20028,15907,14307,8065,7643,6962,519,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,26577,648,409,46524,951,39538,1132,38647,7010,28130,29340,11,5019,85877,440,261,1208,8811,329,648,5636,259,35657,11,5019,64972,1391,40538,3625,8811,3536,11,44351,1744,28130,463,1557,13,81501,1208,55133,48901,409,7643,83067,11,503,34155,20272,26633,79165,75419,13,88125,14896,11,4864,9189,16796,22011,1744,1208,27472,294,22827,1167,5055,15207,8657,275,5019,2211,882,1208,8811,329,648,13,34447,389,25692,6502,20028,16968,653,1179,68,934,80720,88411,11,3869,259,331,19010,316,11,5019,326,57286,664,1291,13,1708,1105,11,503,34155,3608,90859,3846,27584,15207,11,10071,46206,326,22827,4647,1557,13,1252,67781,11,653,6160,38469,389,69152,71151,1208,4647,1557,665,37622,934,6,8629,44618,83597,13,1611,2249,90272,14896,3062,11,503,34155,20272,85114,1367,28154,2436,46206,1208,4647,1557,11,1880,503,34155,3608,90859,951,22337,20243,2482,71269,333,8467,11,7930,274,6,613,372,29580,41869,25843,11,1120,1133,42676,514,15207,304,47391,10515,290,1826,5318,978,13,43987,26178,11,503,6,26577,648,409,46131,4502,272,17771,24068,321,46206,326,6,87713,13,14465,36731,11751,519,3930,934,35329,1826,9071,978,409,46131,4502,11,294,6,434,321,1130,7930,2605,1188,409,3930,29340,11,951,6978,1880,4864,3625,9616,9952,951,924,75004,15878,13,11876,33651,4881,22337,20243,2482,15890,4864,9189,1370,273,11,7591,809,15974,294,6,1334,6316,409,1380,79,12339,13,19421,75804,88253,11,46152,3073,306,951,14645,5019,3625,85877,440,261,7010,514,29340,13,423,10515,440,261,6316,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,87264,56316,28463,4382,1744,951,85877,440,5512,665,436,3972,13,34447,77433,8065,39538,277,441,324,3930,18111,324,11,389,25692,2961,5615,466,409,7631,261,514,46110,945,324,3869,951,60404,409,490,15969,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,6
