{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T22:30:47.370803477Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would give a score of **4** out of 5 for the persuasiveness of the speech.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses storytelling and everyday examples to make their point about how online retailers use data to influence consumer behavior. They also demonstrate an understanding of the psychological factors that drive purchasing decisions, citing research on emotional decision-making. The speaker's tone is conversational and relatable, which makes their message more engaging and accessible.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a point because some parts of the speech feel a bit too casual or anecdotal. While the use of personal experiences can be effective in making a point, the speech could benefit from more formal language and structured arguments to make it even more convincing. Additionally, the speaker's criticism of online retailers feels somewhat superficial and doesn't fully explore the implications of their claims.\n\nOverall, I think the speaker does a good job of crafting a persuasive message that resonates with listeners, but there are areas where they could improve to make it even more effective.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,15089,514,47929,11,9189,47592,15878,294,2182,8065,40970,6316,37291,1367,14081,3904,978,326,6,87713,294,48968,2249,40021,35933,13,1252,51173,11,272,17771,1208,38605,4550,324,409,23126,727,11,1647,49348,52827,11,1880,503,34155,7591,21200,978,3930,20028,653,25500,342,69628,2933,72476,266,13,19421,5019,39043,11,4864,91507,1765,8339,5019,78605,1215,951,15471,417,409,1421,6672,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,653,82711,294,6,472,22660,3930,7528,13,1952,757,281,46651,951,15471,417,11,951,1421,47003,409,36105,11,951,577,7031,1824,4010,11,951,296,11206,351,4428,11,293,1116,11,951,586,35933,1765,5690,13,14465,312,20822,275,653,17258,713,294,98279,301,31307,57992,1765,7011,481,83,13,19421,8065,1620,11,503,6,613,66522,1647,56984,409,1421,6672,11,1744,4864,326,34155,79196,68862,514,39580,93658,7010,653,1486,1375,2852,13,9648,55755,22011,11,503,34155,59062,978,3869,99490,9952,1647,100007,23665,11,1620,69068,514,57992,1765,7011,481,83,11,514,16968,264,1323,546,978,294,6,69175,3016,11,5636,293,20243,2058,11,17258,784,978,1370,326,31769,44294,665,348,11178,324,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,3846,82711,294,6,472,22660,3930,7528,11,3846,6636,6316,32118,4919,2428,86906,99188,1880,1891,53904,2428,11,66228,8047,1370,3625,379,42685,1821,3869,31632,951,12823,3930,7528,11,21273,86396,757,9781,16339,11,281,17194,1880,1375,11967,13,46706,514,4382,719,11,409,757,20028,99490,514,54206,75289,466,13,34447,4068,25692,57375,20028,39043,30,80905,71357,66021,934,85217,14848,409,1208,33537,8047,1765,41091,11,1208,2457,12,6496,18920,13,5034,2457,12,6496,18920,11,1208,1541,8047,45165,23349,305,11368,556,1826,409,1208,1391,10610,648,3930,7528,13,1252,28800,1344,2877,519,665,9859,13,34447,436,395,554,89,45325,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,1744,1208,2457,12,6496,18920,11,3900,379,264,28463,409,326,6,28400,467,11,409,326,6,17060,6082,13,445,6,1735,333,409,7011,481,83,11,665,36788,409,59471,11,6824,68,3869,1491,19010,12329,3869,31632,409,57951,11,409,1615,316,18543,1759,1880,294,6,88988,11,3625,22639,2515,84,14014,1765,3846,33651,2249,45740,2530,8065,32118,4919,278,13,3489,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,7010,1208,83067,951,8403,5019,68226,23761,5625,285,1880,99490,11,3869,31632,409,27750,4046,76,41356,7930,15132,665,84440,30,39783,14240,799,86595,8047,11,8065,84364,409,220,1049,19,11,6316,54613,11,2425,355,409,272,6009,21935,11,20605,265,1744,326,6,17060,6082,4046,20202,64829,28068,64,436,57332,3062,7010,514,85424,409,35881,1854,13,445,6,17060,6082,4046,20202,64829,11,1765,864,52985,665,9859,11,294,22827,81337,11,17317,57038,1208,2457,12,6496,18920,7930,17317,29557,294,6,613,1430,15878,991,1762,46429,42563,11,1880,409,326,49455,265,11,17317,57038,20662,4046,49975,7930,17317,77635,3869,8065,1620,59394,6316,1156,7711,8065,48226,6496,409,1208,2457,12,6496,18920,11,10071,8065,21901,1744,45441,45165,23349,479,514,3016,11,8065,62974,409,1208,33537,8047,7010,514,38900,3930,7528,13,4366,346,1744,514,342,69628,2933,8065,1620,1826,14707,4046,6323,3675,12155,72476,1900,11,1880,272,17771,14707,41091,7930,3625,2665,9667,11,1880,1370,8339,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,369,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,627,198,791,19114,13750,5829,48929,323,18254,10507,311,1304,872,1486,922,1268,2930,30282,1005,828,311,10383,11761,7865,13,2435,1101,20461,459,8830,315,279,24064,9547,430,6678,23395,11429,11,33264,3495,389,14604,5597,28846,13,578,19114,596,16630,374,7669,1697,323,1375,15436,11,902,3727,872,1984,810,23387,323,15987,627,198,11458,11,358,1053,37910,264,1486,1606,1063,5596,315,279,8982,2733,264,2766,2288,16736,477,50750,2426,13,6104,279,1005,315,4443,11704,649,387,7524,304,3339,264,1486,11,279,8982,1436,8935,505,810,16287,4221,323,34030,6105,311,1304,433,1524,810,40661,13,23212,11,279,19114,596,19347,315,2930,30282,11321,14738,59915,323,3250,956,7373,13488,279,25127,315,872,8349,627,198,28589,11,358,1781,279,19114,1587,264,1695,2683,315,45167,264,66343,1984,430,29280,988,449,24475,11,719,1070,527,5789,1405,814,1436,7417,311,1304,433,1524,810,7524,13,128009],"total_duration":7658675302,"load_duration":232045,"prompt_eval_count":757,"prompt_eval_duration":1457011000,"eval_count":205,"eval_duration":6200908000}
