{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T23:41:31.16235248Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"Oxitanie\", \"Tourisme\"), emotional appeals (\"cinq fois la population française\"), and logical reasoning (\"Mataise est prospégative\"). The speaker also shows enthusiasm and passion for their topic, which is contagious and helps to engage the audience.\n\nThe reasoning appears to be rigorous, as the speaker presents data and statistics to support their claims about the importance of tourism in Oxitanie. They also acknowledge the challenges and complexities involved in attracting new tourists and offer suggestions for how to address these issues.\n\nHowever, I would deduct one point because the speech is not entirely free of flaws. For instance, the speaker's use of rhetorical devices can sometimes feel overly dramatic or even manipulative (\"cinq fois la population française\"). Additionally, some of the points made in the speech could be further developed and supported with more concrete evidence.\n\nOverall, I believe that the speaker presents a convincing and persuasive case for the importance of tourism in Oxitanie.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,507,12825,3625,84064,417,3930,14986,44618,13,921,20234,76132,11,3900,5208,13,19421,272,17771,25945,14707,13,3263,42441,89,665,220,679,22,13,39783,54613,1765,220,22,7010,514,38900,264,23933,351,978,90053,409,1208,3197,66522,13,64105,64,50590,348,2784,1744,326,88766,87,13145,648,1826,1208,220,19,68,88100,409,9822,5019,1208,7432,40,951,14986,75460,4046,376,14381,13,19421,49733,11,514,14986,44618,11,272,17771,653,991,5481,648,1765,220,605,13,64105,64,50590,348,2784,1744,326,22827,85877,408,9484,409,46131,39043,513,514,37417,52138,26193,93381,396,409,84364,409,220,3101,11990,294,6,485,65023,355,13,41621,9189,66651,42463,220,3101,11990,11,272,17771,272,6009,37291,1208,7187,93424,13,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,36731,5804,467,20811,1744,326,88766,87,13145,648,264,26725,3625,3869,16968,5019,15907,294,1439,20662,48659,3016,51453,13,1708,1105,13085,89,13,12535,958,1018,461,22299,514,308,9769,10367,25692,20028,5019,15907,294,1439,30,356,17771,43453,14986,17194,13,41621,11,42676,9189,45165,15292,89,45325,47592,951,2109,31539,30,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,73953,1744,3625,14986,75460,1280,1188,28463,11,389,63669,409,2109,31539,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,951,10105,13,89454,1082,6033,3846,10219,265,1765,26725,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,294,69537,361,484,404,11,312,2002,404,1880,20028,19443,404,27750,87325,14986,75460,13,3489,6853,1920,355,48021,665,2035,30,3489,37907,22639,11,934,2053,12823,30,19421,87320,6502,6316,48659,75467,30,41621,326,6,52659,13550,285,30,89454,1082,1826,463,2203,19395,1413,13,29124,45317,648,11,59471,11,75467,12,354,85005,11,15983,38469,11,20662,38317,3613,68495,16968,514,38900,66021,934,80720,11,66021,1744,16968,514,38900,1826,11866,76366,7010,3846,46494,13,1611,84364,6033,409,78060,11,20662,38317,1826,3062,13,1708,1105,11,4864,73953,1744,12155,14986,75460,1280,80463,11,389,63669,11,934,54386,513,24671,409,1131,2009,293,858,333,409,1647,42775,1826,409,282,15433,52424,3625,7970,4978,98733,5512,13,46706,326,39982,9769,23774,11151,321,11,1208,98052,2060,11,3625,6732,31070,8467,11,1880,27584,9189,11,4502,9964,439,379,653,11,7010,26317,6299,13,1708,1105,11,272,17771,83195,11,3900,379,264,12366,11,272,17771,7970,13,7695,379,264,514,1647,10167,91340,356,24540,11,3900,379,264,326,39982,9769,23774,409,9822,11,10071,274,1815,89,1744,84440,11,46152,15132,665,5542,409,4143,1133,665,22199,261,514,84751,1280,3675,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,25632,12339,11,503,6,25632,12339,11,10071,294,58591,978,1869,53819,11,1744,9189,5945,10176,408,23577,409,3846,4545,13,622,6,25632,12339,1744,3846,4545,35737,514,1131,1252,4545,3062,11,7970,9189,13,19421,503,6,25632,12339,1744,87158,9189,91026,978,951,31070,288,1826,103763,5512,7010,29449,7317,6491,556,11,9189,9189,958,299,1414,89,11,9189,11,1765,3846,1744,9189,45366,20028,11,5019,64972,3625,1046,361,484,404,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,87068,7766,1778,439,54515,3573,46,87,13145,648,498,330,56050,44618,4063,14604,35730,3573,66,6009,37291,1208,7187,93424,4063,323,20406,33811,3573,44,460,1082,1826,463,2203,19395,1413,1865,578,19114,1101,5039,36232,323,11939,369,872,8712,11,902,374,89534,323,8779,311,16988,279,10877,627,198,791,33811,8111,311,387,47999,11,439,279,19114,18911,828,323,13443,311,1862,872,8349,922,279,12939,315,32083,304,51715,13145,648,13,2435,1101,25670,279,11774,323,84140,6532,304,51647,502,32753,323,3085,18726,369,1268,311,2686,1521,4819,627,198,11458,11,358,1053,37910,832,1486,1606,279,8982,374,539,11622,1949,315,41859,13,1789,2937,11,279,19114,596,1005,315,87068,7766,649,7170,2733,39532,22520,477,1524,14951,22948,3573,66,6009,37291,1208,7187,93424,1865,23212,11,1063,315,279,3585,1903,304,279,8982,1436,387,4726,8040,323,7396,449,810,14509,6029,627,198,28589,11,358,4510,430,279,19114,18911,264,40661,323,66343,1162,369,279,12939,315,32083,304,51715,13145,648,13,128009],"total_duration":53594338723,"load_duration":147548,"prompt_eval_count":709,"prompt_eval_duration":3053030000,"eval_count":230,"eval_duration":50540662000}
