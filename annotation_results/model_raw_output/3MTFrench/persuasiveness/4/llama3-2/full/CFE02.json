They use metaphors (e.g., \"J'aime les d√©chets\" - \"I love trash\") to make complex concepts more accessible and relatable. The speaker also demonstrates a clear understanding of the scientific principles behind lignin valorization, which adds credibility to their argument.\n\nHowever, I deduct one point because some parts of the speech feel like a poetic monologue rather than a structured, persuasive argument. While this style can be effective in conveying emotions and ideas, it may not fully convince skeptical listeners or provide concrete solutions to specific problems.\n\nOverall, the speaker's enthusiasm and creative storytelling skills make their message more engaging and memorable, which is crucial for inspiring others to support sustainable initiatives.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,26248,547,3625,7591,331,1441,13,41621,26483,19610,829,33288,665,27584,27138,13,57702,1208,10484,13109,1343,5169,13703,817,409,7591,331,1441,934,54386,264,934,31109,296,1130,1765,20662,3197,66522,11,64972,4499,5512,264,3212,1744,3625,7591,1985,5512,13,1708,1105,11,4502,389,864,77,1339,779,258,409,12155,7591,331,1441,11,259,21198,5019,2558,556,3930,26365,1291,11,389,69152,3930,66304,11,272,17771,14707,4635,84,13,46706,8941,11741,1339,11,1208,2849,1130,305,3538,13,34447,11,389,78422,12339,28463,8065,21765,220,1041,11990,409,52021,1370,459,11,409,1647,7591,331,1441,27389,69,68862,13,5034,72700,483,11,26633,90272,75164,3682,60224,3930,66304,13,1952,841,829,275,6502,75249,20028,45575,389,326,26248,1437,30872,273,5019,2558,556,409,326,31769,64374,13,435,2957,1826,54312,409,21273,258,30,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,46838,404,569,64656,33254,424,1208,72700,483,951,1344,8836,288,13,14465,52571,42463,1744,72353,668,264,14448,69068,3846,7591,331,1441,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,4864,56445,46939,1370,8464,6316,5017,978,3869,1208,72700,483,13,14465,25400,21559,951,463,339,978,1572,5019,1208,9517,533,1553,8065,53052,409,27750,19670,288,294,6,61263,70,48099,13,46408,312,59976,3930,97418,951,1376,288,11,97507,11,39043,296,26248,16603,3625,1400,31539,49806,288,13,9240,68,829,16458,554,8841,1640,2428,13,432,5512,495,266,409,829,19266,36235,369,51084,9952,1208,2849,1130,305,3538,13,27058,1208,65827,268,404,11,4864,25400,30179,6960,653,47838,7591,331,1441,13,386,5014,12,466,417,436,2642,645,409,7643,38672,82,11,514,72006,12,39754,74801,438,13,34447,4502,9189,23933,10333,3846,7591,331,1441,11,934,54386,25692,46131,490,32453,7010,1208,11277,409,1208,4671,8511,13,27058,28130,10607,11,4864,9517,1072,285,757,1765,665,281,3023,265,13,32429,4502,9964,274,6,300,993,13559,22299,39043,46206,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,11,272,3433,978,41091,11,7591,331,1441,5636,7591,331,1441,11,39043,2489,13,51097,26633,463,339,978,11932,75460,15132,19227,1001,37608,36527,7930,514,1913,79738,1370,71751,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,13,39783,80444,409,88247,2428,5790,10676,978,11,6160,536,78130,11,63828,1414,665,36292,1880,90551,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,8162,1474,978,376,2428,11,4864,326,6,49133,7010,3625,4647,485,417,951,9986,645,13,14465,514,490,33462,554,11,4864,326,6,44803,325,11,4864,75765,829,31807,4011,32118,4919,2428,13,1252,2816,25692,23761,1744,2486,467,11,5019,3869,312,10398,15170,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,7010,3625,757,392,645,409,12155,31547,1572,11,1208,348,87960,3869,1208,81645,11,1208,1080,593,409,12155,43116,17144,11,1370,1647,42775,1880,665,14448,285,519,1880,4046,67,5615,9211,22299,1208,4671,483,11,503,6,391,45808,6316,6425,27220,8065,1323,16491,951,88247,8467,2425,355,3930,281,10515,5898,13,19421,97507,11,9189,23933,10333,11,9952,653,1437,258,409,68567,44618,28463,11,389,25692,20028,1860,11967,514,38900,13,4418,66,97507,11,46152,15132,19227,1001,37608,36527,7930,33537,306,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,8162,1474,978,376,2428,11,503,6,49133,3625,78352,409,326,6,867,75,1082,11,389,523,2428,13,2009,9517,79,10515,306,11,389,2109,1339,326,6,90446,13,19421,4160,321,6496,11,39587,503,34155,5906,409,17571,951,297,398,325,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,5016,36815,4999,198,6153,15884,5403,1555,279,1495,11,358,4265,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,11263,1473,9,9,59742,84,300,13071,68063,220,19,14,20,198,198,791,19114,18911,459,23387,323,11782,19775,430,13750,390,50369,872,11939,369,41329,323,19297,13,2435,1005,31768,1105,320,68,13,70,2637,330,41,6,64,547,3625,7591,331,1441,1,482,330,40,3021,23701,909,311,1304,6485,19476,810,15987,323,1375,15436,13,578,19114,1101,32216,264,2867,8830,315,279,12624,16565,4920,72700,258,14448,2065,11,902,11621,38769,311,872,5811,627,198,11458,11,358,37910,832,1486,1606,1063,5596,315,279,8982,2733,1093,264,76534,1647,77828,4856,1109,264,34030,11,66343,5811,13,6104,420,1742,649,387,7524,304,94165,21958,323,6848,11,433,1253,539,7373,28008,44929,24475,477,3493,14509,10105,311,3230,5435,627,198,28589,11,279,19114,596,36232,323,11782,48929,7512,1304,872,1984,810,23387,323,33596,11,902,374,16996,369,34147,3885,311,1862,22556,28271,13,128009],"total_duration":46382776476,"load_duration":224584,"prompt_eval_count":804,"prompt_eval_duration":3472713000,"eval_count":195
