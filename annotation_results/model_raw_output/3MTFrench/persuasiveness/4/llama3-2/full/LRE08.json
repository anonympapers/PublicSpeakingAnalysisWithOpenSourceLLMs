{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T01:15:16.903407171Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 3 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker starts by using some interesting linguistic devices, such as made-up words and rhyming couplets, which can be engaging and memorable. However, the content of the speech is somewhat unclear and disjointed, with the speaker jumping from one topic to another without much coherence. The use of vague terms like \"4 de vie\" and \"vocallifier\" also makes it difficult to understand what the speaker is trying to say.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's tone and language are often playful and humorous, which may not be effective in conveying a serious message about environmental issues and waste management. While some listeners might appreciate the creative approach, others may find it distracting or even confusing.\n\nOverall, while the speech has some engaging moments, its persuasiveness is limited by its unclear content, disjointed structure, and lack of rigor in reasoning.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2009,356,978,6489,285,9189,687,978,6316,87810,11,326,6,90446,409,12155,99309,523,268,370,417,7930,15132,6502,3625,4865,13,12095,4864,308,41901,1370,273,55455,409,20662,87810,11,3900,379,50590,11,12155,387,1354,11,3625,293,17724,11,12155,387,1354,11,1880,264,55455,3869,31050,277,13,81245,97958,28463,32592,514,44630,409,1488,8039,11,409,26365,1291,409,85434,13,19421,3900,274,6,329,263,1215,665,28130,10479,588,3869,26317,54698,7930,97958,15878,6316,294,2182,11,3869,30711,68636,13,12095,14707,934,81991,46131,11,934,6,60917,12416,39929,11,389,264,342,3326,978,1880,20272,513,26483,15610,11,3900,43989,28130,11457,355,294,6,14283,23008,9211,514,47838,73173,13,34447,3900,264,39043,3869,27389,35573,57625,15610,11,649,391,978,1880,23761,934,6,2933,282,9011,73,283,978,11,1486,409,29449,73173,11,25500,25595,4618,1880,665,490,978,1130,13,34447,8065,78060,11,934,17771,54312,934,35329,13835,11,272,76832,308,17771,6502,6316,293,5599,6672,11,272,76832,1826,653,25945,6141,265,13,3700,698,8536,11,3625,26365,47003,17317,22641,306,13,2998,67781,11,514,76354,11,514,513,95959,2922,6496,11,11412,326,6,269,12329,7010,409,51651,3044,11,11412,3625,513,757,66517,519,7010,13,19421,39587,11,45602,29557,30532,7010,409,51651,3044,86595,8047,409,27389,4120,29449,50026,40280,11,409,40192,404,44767,12155,220,19,409,17536,11,409,12253,543,3125,12155,594,40751,7138,75,645,1880,46131,27584,7010,75831,409,80080,13,43987,26178,11,4502,4864,9189,834,11,220,6843,11,220,22956,11,272,17771,6502,3625,523,2142,3930,326,2117,11,568,258,13,7695,274,6,74972,665,20272,79071,14896,294,22827,28800,40970,13901,13,7695,274,6,74972,409,1208,10484,13109,409,7591,9211,665,57625,4618,11,46777,76132,11,1208,9517,16588,13,12095,14707,11,1880,665,1206,1334,11,220,6843,220,931,52021,409,7591,331,1441,13,921,20234,76132,11,46777,14464,519,11,4160,556,653,4502,39587,11,220,2031,4,409,28130,7591,9211,665,57625,4618,11,45441,45602,8024,665,1206,1334,3869,220,10617,15395,437,409,7591,331,1441,13,356,17771,39587,44351,7010,20662,52088,978,8637,2428,11,665,665,26305,42463,44767,3625,96642,3230,35933,409,326,6,25108,273,11,19227,1744,1208,6573,277,13109,11,3577,290,28405,5979,12339,6033,35597,14425,24918,1880,1647,4876,2428,11,1744,1647,46494,274,6,1354,38096,665,26633,3585,13,4418,66,11,665,220,16,11,22299,11083,87892,11,1880,28800,409,259,3527,91298,11,80740,3869,1925,11,4864,296,41901,91507,7591,10551,16339,1880,7591,848,261,3625,85114,342,2191,729,1880,3419,23202,2053,409,7591,9211,13,19421,272,76832,11,54401,409,64972,60946,265,1208,1515,2428,1880,1208,79641,1132,68,409,1208,5788,951,7591,331,1441,11,665,26633,11,9465,3600,11,1491,75473,8082,1880,1156,10610,3370,27389,8644,333,11,4864,296,41901,91507,10045,261,85114,33013,98942,409,9517,23475,1880,272,76832,54401,409,29068,29449,5945,265,11,272,17771,29449,31807,7232,11,951,1913,552,11,10071,44767,5019,64972,14448,12329,12155,7591,331,1441,13,34447,6666,7010,326,58736,20243,1516,409,3846,42775,11,46777,304,1321,306,11,46777,13033,68,42463,13,19421,272,17771,5019,45602,1744,4864,296,6,61375,3869,9189,75804,88253,13,71823,20263,16222,118904,283,751,668,11,4864,9189,3008,535,9189,3869,7643,934,37093,1880,7591,67,978,35115,12155,961,1291,519,3869,1208,39879,37093,13,25145,72,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,18,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,1701,1063,7185,65767,7766,11,1778,439,1903,5352,4339,323,22408,1631,287,5743,2641,11,902,649,387,23387,323,33596,13,4452,11,279,2262,315,279,8982,374,14738,25420,323,85884,291,11,449,279,19114,30102,505,832,8712,311,2500,2085,1790,78925,13,578,1005,315,40146,3878,1093,330,19,409,17536,1,323,330,85,511,543,3125,1,1101,3727,433,5107,311,3619,1148,279,19114,374,4560,311,2019,627,198,50674,11,279,19114,596,16630,323,4221,527,3629,57169,323,70946,11,902,1253,539,387,7524,304,94165,264,6129,1984,922,12434,4819,323,12571,6373,13,6104,1063,24475,2643,15763,279,11782,5603,11,3885,1253,1505,433,82398,477,1524,31715,627,198,28589,11,1418,279,8982,706,1063,23387,14269,11,1202,24613,300,13071,374,7347,555,1202,25420,2262,11,85884,291,6070,11,323,6996,315,78477,304,33811,13,128009],"total_duration":45895914752,"load_duration":141458,"prompt_eval_count":798,"prompt_eval_duration":3428616000,"eval_count":193,"eval_duration":42466645000}
