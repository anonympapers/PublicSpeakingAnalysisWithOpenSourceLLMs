They then explain the concept of meta-digestion and its potential application in waste management. The analogy used to illustrate this process is creative and helps to simplify a complex idea.\n\nHowever, the speech lacks coherence and logical flow. The speaker jumps abruptly from introducing their thesis topic to explaining the different groups of bacteria involved in the meta-digestion process. This sudden shift in focus can be confusing for the audience.\n\nAdditionally, the use of overly technical language and obscure terms like \"méta-nogènes\" may not be familiar or accessible to all listeners. The speech could benefit from a clearer structure, more concise explanations, and fewer technical jargon.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's enthusiasm is contagious, their message could be strengthened by refining their delivery and making it more engaging for a broader audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,65673,11,7643,1925,11,503,34155,6316,25626,48659,3869,9189,63991,3913,13,14465,91507,20028,6316,270,4558,325,1765,514,89714,951,7591,331,1441,13,2057,72,39015,11,60019,11,9964,44496,5916,261,8065,7591,331,1441,1880,272,17771,653,10484,14240,799,5019,39043,13,34447,27549,1826,11,1826,54312,1744,4864,51441,1028,9148,8646,1744,9964,439,1208,12155,978,13283,42676,6502,15878,77558,6316,281,13649,6853,30,14465,91507,9189,3327,72684,39723,1826,7643,1925,13,74656,97717,11,4864,514,2322,668,1208,1925,3869,1208,281,69628,11,272,17771,1515,2428,13,19421,281,18826,11,272,17771,1120,1133,5019,45602,1744,4864,77438,635,58673,15610,1765,20662,76680,8637,2428,13,16233,92622,9189,11,1744,1208,3682,13109,294,31769,339,978,331,1441,11,1744,17317,2558,19941,11,15132,665,282,788,2902,552,13,1708,1105,11,7930,92215,23761,14448,69068,4046,39624,10515,81235,1370,32118,2629,1773,5512,367,13,507,2005,11,10071,27549,1826,54312,934,17771,75249,1208,32118,2629,1773,5512,367,30,19421,14707,11,16968,71357,11,272,17771,4839,1133,3846,934,35329,513,39904,7010,29449,72601,21552,333,13,48109,60534,2439,11,17317,4170,978,26692,11,44829,17317,48041,275,2439,951,19637,645,1880,3930,56086,11,9952,514,43014,17317,17258,85,2439,2558,556,409,326,31769,64374,13,29179,321,6496,11,4068,503,34155,63991,51084,1647,70927,3869,11083,1370,7298,13,46706,12155,281,5599,37907,11,39043,76605,9189,3846,1744,326,54386,92215,296,57286,276,12329,13,19421,14707,11,3846,15132,26725,3625,7591,331,1441,2942,8467,11,9952,3625,2800,1900,38450,17724,11,6033,35597,3625,7558,2439,5945,484,5512,7930,841,56311,5636,23761,92465,5512,13,27058,57625,294,31109,887,8047,11,84364,409,1208,4647,12583,978,409,12155,281,5599,37907,11,5019,23761,23761,32118,2629,1773,5512,367,13,5783,434,519,11,308,17771,54312,6502,30,1221,846,79507,11,4864,42775,273,1765,951,1367,14081,3904,811,5019,9189,13510,11,3698,3675,409,32118,2629,1773,5512,367,17317,17258,85,2439,2558,556,9952,19227,6033,19227,7591,331,1441,13,2998,51092,11,503,6,19680,1082,20662,5788,13,27058,45602,11,4864,66517,58673,15610,11083,3539,5512,3869,1208,13826,25108,818,11,19227,83597,409,57128,13,40602,398,29150,1826,514,21134,3869,58673,15610,13,2998,51092,11,86100,3869,274,59858,294,6,11968,288,11,44829,3869,42067,297,4469,818,1880,665,5589,32118,2629,5392,540,4558,4978,11,7930,54206,514,32118,2629,5392,13,3206,1665,333,1826,4382,11,19227,29449,85424,11,58673,484,978,5636,5019,2558,556,5636,5019,342,40538,5636,13,2998,59157,13109,11,46777,3539,978,8024,3869,653,57951,409,293,533,978,4108,11,95917,359,9952,6316,34501,71269,52760,13,43987,26178,11,13085,89,5392,788,1744,79380,294,6,11968,288,45441,8811,1037,11,1744,3846,3347,547,11,65396,11,54613,841,25692,514,69241,9779,13,5034,5788,1826,2961,49530,8047,11,272,17771,5019,45602,11,1744,4864,7515,38966,3869,11083,3539,5512,951,4787,409,42775,23669,11,22299,653,1069,1557,26878,265,6033,6316,91317,10737,8047,13,27058,1913,404,11,4864,296,6,8039,19010,1082,514,16968,11,54401,409,9189,13510,11,3698,3675,409,32118,2629,5392,11,17317,17258,85,2439,2558,556,9952,326,6,49575,409,12155,7591,331,1441,2942,8467,5019,1744,12155,281,5599,37907,2558,285,306,326,31769,64374,409,2486,467,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,83463,334,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,3146,18,14,20,334,13,198,198,791,19114,8638,555,38787,872,17850,8712,11,902,5084,7185,323,9959,311,279,10877,13,2435,1243,10552,279,7434,315,8999,1773,15505,290,323,1202,4754,3851,304,12571,6373,13,578,56203,1511,311,41468,420,1920,374,11782,323,8779,311,40821,264,6485,4623,627,198,11458,11,279,8982,37856,78925,323,20406,6530,13,578,19114,35308,60845,505,33018,872,17850,8712,311,26073,279,2204,5315,315,24032,6532,304,279,8999,1773,15505,290,1920,13,1115,11210,6541,304,5357,649,387,31715,369,279,10877,627,198,50674,11,279,1005,315,39532,11156,4221,323,40634,3878,1093,330,102843,2629,5392,540,4558,4978,1,1253,539,387,11537,477,15987,311,682,24475,13,578,8982,1436,8935,505,264,49479,6070,11,810,64694,41941,11,323,17162,11156,503,71921,627,198,28589,11,1418,279,19114,596,36232,374,89534,11,872,1984,1436,387,60862,555,74285,872,9889,323,3339,433,810,23387,369,264,27927,10877,13,128009],"total_duration":48226129302,"load_duration":145664,"prompt_eval_count":773,"prompt_eval_duration":3357328000,"eval_count":204,"eval_duration":44868049000}
