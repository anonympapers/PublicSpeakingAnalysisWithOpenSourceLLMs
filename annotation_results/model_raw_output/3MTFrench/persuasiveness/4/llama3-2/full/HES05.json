The speaker also uses logical reasoning to connect their ideas, making it easier for the audience to follow their argument.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give a perfect score is that the speech could benefit from more concrete evidence or data to support some of the claims made. Additionally, some parts of the speech seem to be more focused on entertaining the audience rather than providing a rigorous argument. However, overall, the speaker does an excellent job of conveying their message in a clear and engaging manner.\n\nScore:
