{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T01:19:13.816575981Z","response":"**SCALE:** [1-5]\n\n**DIMENSION:** Persuasiveness of the speech\n\n**TASK:** Evaluate the transcript of the public performance.\n\nAfter analyzing the transcript, I would give a score of **4.2**.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by providing historical context and specific examples to support their argument. The use of statistics (e.g., \"10 times more\") adds weight to their claims. Additionally, the speaker's passion and enthusiasm are palpable throughout the performance, making it engaging for the audience.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 0.8 points because some parts of the speech feel somewhat disconnected or lacking in depth. For instance, when the speaker mentions specific examples of American influence in Tahiti (e.g., \"99% of our ears...\"), they could have provided more details to make their point more convincing. Additionally, there are a few moments where the language becomes slightly too formal or dry, which might detract from the overall impact.\n\nOverall, I believe the speaker presents a strong case, but with some minor areas for improvement.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,64105,64,348,1339,9189,1744,220,1484,4,409,12155,16536,2249,665,503,34155,75804,88253,15132,1179,5512,409,79869,648,11,10071,39043,348,1339,9189,76776,934,35329,379,264,220,3965,8261,1880,42844,84364,294,22827,93128,1355,72,4558,593,11,272,17771,39015,79869,648,7930,1179,1339,15907,16536,2249,409,12460,275,648,13,19421,272,76832,308,17771,1744,326,22827,951,13026,4881,94320,645,7930,57705,14081,1082,11,20662,12976,1097,39965,467,259,1339,3675,4502,28800,4635,361,13,14465,66517,6316,1296,1765,3625,1097,39965,1771,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,11,3869,12460,275,648,7010,3625,14701,645,409,326,6,533,4088,3735,84267,648,93424,13,19421,71151,3625,15471,417,294,6,90446,3735,84267,26584,1375,9011,17187,1208,21425,13109,44579,677,1018,276,2428,8065,70927,409,12460,275,648,13,34447,220,5599,1477,1208,30179,768,951,1097,39965,1771,8065,27584,4545,13,3383,39965,467,7930,19477,3159,16968,409,27584,16968,8065,1317,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,11,1208,2307,18757,24918,934,35329,513,8175,68,8065,220,508,68,97739,9326,13,19421,272,17771,39587,39015,1744,503,55624,651,1188,13,14465,77438,635,52895,716,326,27688,8047,294,31109,14701,273,409,12460,275,648,11,503,6,329,1082,1685,593,1097,39965,8511,13,11876,20662,12976,19428,9465,3625,1097,39965,1771,1880,3625,3735,84267,3675,11,308,6,546,312,5259,84,1370,3625,84939,2852,7930,22641,306,76776,8065,32118,97495,1208,5457,409,326,52152,41116,56404,4558,9459,7010,20662,14701,273,13,3206,42775,409,38317,1765,3625,39104,951,281,14460,3869,2700,409,55133,65285,266,13,11876,45383,11,22299,389,3625,9859,76,1339,3869,326,31769,5481,593,11,97958,81786,7010,3625,272,6009,5438,575,2053,409,326,6,533,4088,3735,84267,648,93424,13,19421,27750,14701,645,97958,1097,39965,33903,33670,294,93825,93424,13,11842,6502,6316,15235,648,1097,39965,8511,11,27584,4502,665,220,972,1032,11,514,2126,2727,294,6,269,6941,39037,11,54368,288,12155,1080,2902,1553,13,1611,829,83187,20770,11,15878,326,69537,541,409,6652,11,7930,841,65827,72,61799,6502,4538,1180,68,13,19421,9189,23933,10333,49733,11,326,31109,951,513,14630,29059,1439,951,281,14460,11,39723,326,54386,4160,275,653,294,20432,2933,1097,39965,467,11,6136,978,1765,514,74206,3678,9383,3675,13,34447,96308,6316,10383,1097,39965,8511,1880,653,5536,12108,33670,514,5541,76378,266,1880,326,62595,1859,1370,3625,84939,2852,13,1611,5636,11,3625,293,6750,14014,1880,46106,8235,3946,1097,39965,1771,97958,52579,409,220,605,37291,5636,81786,1744,3625,8235,3946,951,46106,17089,7010,514,2700,409,26365,1291,2442,97110,97110,9465,220,972,1958,1880,220,972,4370,13,2998,220,972,1774,11,220,777,293,6750,14014,9314,531,4558,8135,3846,934,81991,1208,26365,1291,2442,97110,97110,13,56744,72,84440,11,25654,276,3209,2852,11,304,124524,2852,1880,26725,3625,46106,97958,1097,39965,1771,13,5034,88602,3159,20198,6960,11,9637,38672,83,556,2215,85,1339,26633,293,6750,14014,55467,11,1280,41098,978,55520,1880,220,806,11,1880,97507,11,220,806,293,6750,14014,1097,39965,1771,13,1952,13085,45575,326,6,58400,82653,2428,11,10071,76776,3674,409,20662,30179,768,13,2998,46106,11,3625,348,526,19010,56276,1097,39965,33903,409,9637,38672,83,285,1880,951,14701,645,922,4918,3869,1208,1913,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,653,459,5192,425,2848,2159,409,56321,44230,294,6,4775,483,1097,39965,8511,7930,3381,409,76076,7230,1572,1572,35597,75804,88253,11,79641,494,2439,951,11599,75460,1880,951,8528,6388,2249,13,3206,1665,333,1826,39587,409,20028,74282,66014,8065,7230,1572,3675,514,220,777,68,97739,9326,11,7930,20272,48901,409,28130,81621,463,1557,13,3341,514,20272,294,55624,978,911,261,4538,87810,463,1557,1880,409,74282,66014,326,6,4775,483,1370,86633,4046,376,526,12339,409,76076,409,27750,264,3742,11,25692,29557,10367,8065,7230,1572,3675,294,6,395,3471,7245,38284,1880,87011,7521,1133,1208,2860,13109,409,28130,3608,13109,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,66068,68063,510,16,12,20,60,198,198,334,76219,24557,68063,21097,84,300,13071,315,279,8982,198,198,334,66913,68063,55215,279,36815,315,279,586,5178,627,198,6153,42118,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,3146,19,13,17,334,13,198,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,8405,13970,2317,323,3230,10507,311,1862,872,5811,13,578,1005,315,13443,320,68,13,70,2637,330,605,3115,810,909,11621,4785,311,872,8349,13,23212,11,279,19114,596,11939,323,36232,527,75649,481,6957,279,5178,11,3339,433,23387,369,279,10877,627,198,11458,11,358,1053,
