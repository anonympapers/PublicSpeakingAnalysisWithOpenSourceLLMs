Starting with a hook that grabs the audience's attention: the question about \"b√¢tonner\" and \"connens\" that relates to ice cream, but ultimately leads to a discussion about vision.\n2. Providing clear explanations of complex scientific concepts, such as the cascade of 9 molecules in the eye, making it accessible to a non-expert audience.\n3. Using analogies and metaphors to help illustrate the points being made (e.g., comparing the cells in the eye to mutants X-Men).\n4. Showing enthusiasm and passion for the topic, which is infectious and makes the audience more engaged.\n5. Providing specific examples and results from scientific studies (e.g., the improvement in vision in mice) that demonstrate the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that the speaker's tone is somewhat formal and lacks a strong emotional appeal to the audience. The speech is well-structured, but it doesn't have a dramatic or emotive edge that would make it truly unforgettable.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,3869,26725,13,14465,91507,1081,20099,1370,9189,1153,261,6316,38920,3488,13,9605,9189,86100,89,409,1208,326,77025,40807,4502,4864,9189,834,3625,78199,11,293,9011,783,261,1880,390,818,949,14465,36731,3738,1744,3625,5636,342,414,1969,82,294,6,40997,9189,665,23423,64,1188,3869,1208,2840,580,13,34447,75804,88253,11,4864,841,91507,6502,9189,89504,409,2840,580,10071,409,1208,11376,13,19421,97507,11,3625,293,9011,783,1215,1880,3625,4635,288,15132,951,2849,2482,30179,812,7010,29449,99225,321,1880,17317,29557,73468,409,46131,13,11876,293,9011,783,1215,17317,29557,73468,409,46131,326,6,1036,4168,1880,3625,4635,288,17317,29557,73468,409,46131,514,9880,13,12535,1826,54312,1744,39043,34501,818,949,1708,1105,3613,81,4558,79507,11,3869,326,55624,57663,409,27750,2849,2482,11,17317,57038,6316,43118,409,220,24,22337,20243,2482,22299,45366,31307,46131,665,62321,11,7930,34501,818,85434,1880,9880,13,445,1105,593,1208,41263,20712,17782,7010,326,6,52822,321,11,272,17771,25692,85815,1647,4046,56745,11,82133,2107,466,1208,41263,20712,1880,513,1380,4150,10367,514,1984,5019,61166,1880,43678,20662,41263,20712,665,653,74206,1984,7930,11412,2961,1553,55398,6,2933,272,5976,2933,13,4366,45973,11,274,35329,379,264,6316,70673,648,7010,514,7970,34501,40280,409,27750,2849,2482,1880,409,27750,22337,20243,2482,11,45575,1208,43118,274,6,1138,37093,13,356,17771,514,4865,5019,5636,409,220,966,220,931,84939,2852,11,86696,4046,911,1821,7930,15132,9604,1157,294,31109,8811,329,648,78422,99188,9024,1744,326,54386,917,6853,1208,9517,83,16235,77678,12267,13,46706,20662,8811,329,648,11,653,951,60120,7930,22011,1744,259,65948,582,19010,2482,11,3846,934,80720,42182,20028,11,1826,5318,978,13,80905,22299,7010,1208,47528,951,88754,1630,50559,7930,1370,6316,27472,15132,85114,951,48577,49742,17724,13,34447,32150,47668,3869,27750,88754,1630,50559,7930,14848,951,2307,17258,3415,17260,11,3625,6978,2700,38647,409,27750,34684,41518,306,28130,48234,46110,3869,46110,13,423,6,370,541,11,3900,41518,1208,11376,409,85434,1841,27549,1826,16120,13767,648,22299,665,2863,285,1768,66522,11,76826,46152,14848,6316,48416,1516,3930,35641,409,11376,514,9880,1841,27549,1826,390,834,15138,77422,272,4896,265,7364,1880,8065,1620,46152,3567,72,89810,42738,2249,13,12535,92215,10539,20028,5019,3625,91878,949,3402,39614,514,36963,1370,51173,11,272,17771,3284,13,27058,45602,11,389,92215,45453,7420,514,36963,5318,978,9952,1208,2373,1156,48099,409,3846,36963,16968,22299,326,6,768,934,54386,45453,7404,6316,2267,1088,294,6,2419,540,4714,383,7010,653,38900,13,62408,15105,3869,653,9859,11,272,17771,1208,76680,4714,648,78422,67592,13,46408,264,4635,84,51854,94499,9400,8467,27750,36852,59307,65838,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,1744,829,5142,668,523,12339,409,45453,7420,46777,27472,409,60120,1880,39043,62163,28463,48488,409,27138,13,1611,5636,11,5636,409,1208,4647,12583,978,951,60120,4294,4893,409,1208,9517,83,16235,77678,12267,15132,75804,88253,35597,304,5259,84,13,2009,5636,92759,519,87264,39587,409,52895,716,653,89714,5019,779,78756,3625,12104,9769,9004,409,20662,8811,329,648,28800,1179,68,1208,27472,13,1952,1826,14707,294,69537,541,1765,3846,1486,13,356,17771,3846,1744,503,6,434,61055,409,20028,41199,220,679,20,13,33150,39381,409,23008,9211,1208,5353,46206,46777,8893,11,503,34155,14240,21178,978,1208,43118,409,220,24,22337,20243,2482,7010,653,83597,409,20897,285,409,9517,83,16235,77678,12267,13,19421,3869,31632,409,40744,27750,44827,11,503,34155,84788,72,3869,75831,6316,13726,43118,9952,71686,26633,33013,98942,22299,9189,45366,514,46131,665,3122,13,39783,22337,978,3395,375,3869,281,9011,2392,409,2107,466,1208,41263,20712,1880,6316,47838,22337,978,3395,375,3869,281,9011,2392,409,43678,1880,1380,4150,10367,514,1984,8065,272,5976,2933,13,445,52152,7761,409,27750,26633,22337,20243,2482,7010,326,6,52822,321,409,1208,20897,285,264,14175,285,294,58591,73511,15171,1208,11376,42844,51854,5347,33903,13,356,17771,6316,25945,39892,281,17194,1880,7477,99188,13,3341,45889,5347,33903,409,47371,292,2492,1880,76680,4714,10515,8467,46206,1208,20897,285,1880,5142,978,14707,8024,3869,51854,65838,46206,326,6,87713,13,14465,436,5615,424,2852,934,22827,9880,27750,100246,1826,29557,376,546,294,31769,74199,404,653,36963,35030,292,2908,7930,44829,325,91878,27750,6978,93381,21719,409,9517,83,16235,77678,12267,264,27389,4120,28130,48234,1880,39929,18757,1317,67380,13,25145,72,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25
