{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-27T01:37:51.405076425Z","response":"**EVALUATION**\n\nAfter reading the transcript, I have evaluated the public performance using the dimension \"persuasiveness\" and the scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much).\n\n**SCORE: 2.5/5**\n\nThe speaker's message is somewhat convincing, but there are some weaknesses that prevent it from being more effective.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* The speaker tries to engage the audience with a personal anecdote and uses rhetorical devices like metaphors (\"déménagement des déplacements\") to make their message more relatable.\n* They provide some details about the technology they're proposing, such as \"l'hide-conmécation,\" which shows that they have done research on the topic.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* The speech is somewhat disorganized and jumps between different ideas. This makes it hard to follow and can confuse the audience.\n* Some of the language used is overly complex or technical, which may alienate some listeners who are not familiar with these terms.\n* The speaker's argument could be stronger if they provided more concrete examples or data to support their claims.\n\nOverall, while the speaker shows some promise in crafting a convincing message, there is room for improvement in terms of organization, language, and supporting evidence.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,5034,3355,23775,1826,653,7591,6489,71933,951,7591,64635,3625,5636,42587,5512,409,12155,49301,13,445,6,454,321,1295,264,1208,326,13649,409,4294,87782,294,58591,804,3625,1522,11467,3869,9284,13,5034,10758,7855,9465,3846,62891,1880,1208,43905,1200,114776,6900,89,4170,84,1291,514,99988,292,264,28154,268,11,274,17771,20272,9964,1180,77776,3869,31632,294,22827,4865,593,9559,978,3869,1208,3355,23775,1370,653,48924,901,13,38891,89,1744,9189,961,10333,665,9467,3095,41199,3273,275,4918,5019,48908,7010,6316,14701,273,13,16062,1522,52760,5019,20028,409,1208,628,647,8047,4046,56745,6033,5019,15265,11715,1295,11,7591,6595,68,514,4865,593,8065,4545,39723,1208,15119,451,6155,57332,326,6,41540,68,934,22827,47838,1860,290,17782,665,3663,13,2009,10121,264,326,93847,304,1880,83457,802,481,1880,9189,42775,273,2439,4538,5395,664,7010,514,1522,52760,13,41621,86768,89,3869,326,6,1885,265,1880,409,1208,628,647,8047,11,10071,6316,628,647,8047,1826,665,75,48099,13,452,17771,19477,3159,978,264,28154,268,11,77438,635,3625,69241,9779,1370,951,4865,14295,15878,1488,13,41621,7631,10333,25692,85815,87320,514,1522,4558,1001,264,523,13109,951,4865,14295,3930,36754,13,7695,308,17771,46680,969,1001,7631,978,85877,408,265,6033,409,48021,3869,1647,1860,290,16968,3869,1370,261,15878,1488,1841,272,17771,62891,5019,9189,18713,84,424,514,7970,28405,66,10610,1133,409,326,49152,290,13,386,23034,4502,15265,11715,1295,264,24560,94616,978,25692,85815,1744,15265,1860,290,308,6,4202,1339,6502,10121,978,11,10071,514,6225,1488,3869,1208,281,9011,1557,1744,326,6,277,2171,978,7591,376,52659,272,17771,3625,1370,30148,1880,653,8818,17194,259,14041,1370,8318,3625,1522,11467,11,8065,9517,75,6496,67239,978,409,281,556,3869,43116,51271,11,7591,52439,55506,15265,1860,290,5019,9189,20028,264,28154,268,8065,281,57332,48734,13,77411,3869,326,49455,265,11,7591,1897,84,409,1208,628,647,8047,1370,40970,409,220,1272,7591,911,5512,13,4242,4558,325,3869,67807,3930,955,409,10045,261,653,4865,593,15878,1488,1880,65461,69068,13,27058,379,2961,1553,11,503,6,4683,14081,3904,2852,326,100017,409,1208,2869,38469,11,326,6,8727,15204,76,20243,367,13,356,17771,6316,2869,38469,7930,69152,1208,41263,20712,5019,1380,4150,10367,951,44827,13,1952,841,6502,4046,447,13154,514,4865,593,7010,6316,17258,273,1206,978,354,5048,8065,10025,593,409,18713,30970,1208,20545,3930,11715,1295,13,622,49963,1082,1208,41263,20712,30547,3869,326,6,52822,321,11,76190,8047,653,6816,4838,13,12095,3625,7317,9769,20975,1826,8065,9189,665,20272,11,296,26248,33614,1744,7010,653,384,412,25646,11,3625,5440,17724,11457,355,9189,2700,10333,3846,16081,5019,379,75144,951,7990,288,21965,29465,4282,13,11876,7317,9769,2392,1826,665,20272,9952,9189,11,17317,4160,552,6502,1208,41263,20712,11,1880,15132,39587,52579,1370,13051,13,2998,9517,1264,978,11,326,100017,409,1208,2869,38469,11,326,6,8727,15204,76,20243,367,264,653,2033,1860,25843,13,46408,841,41518,9964,5320,2249,6502,514,7970,34501,40280,409,326,49152,290,11,12266,409,30711,977,3625,17320,1841,272,17771,4502,66167,2389,258,978,3869,326,55624,57663,409,1208,22239,483,409,11715,1295,425,13,14465,42775,273,11,1180,77776,11,9952,514,19477,3159,294,49152,290,3869,11737,11,5019,4046,447,13154,28130,1344,51111,9952,20662,46798,1018,22235,13,27058,514,4545,11,17317,74533,665,10474,409,1760,354,575,425,1841,3900,17317,66167,3625,1719,75104,409,77463,11,409,9314,87782,1880,409,60128,3869,46524,13,362,32384,11,389,5019,969,1097,73511,15171,13,445,93847,98642,951,11715,6429,11,16968,665,40192,66262,11,1208,77463,13,19421,9189,5019,23577,44351,11,84568,7631,306,3869,326,6,15433,519,514,23744,52760,11,5019,20028,15265,628,647,978,13,7695,757,66167,35597,48488,409,42775,11,10071,4502,9189,348,2784,82,23761,6666,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,36,5711,52,3579,334,198,198,6153,5403,279,36815,11,358,617,26126,279,586,5178,1701,279,13167,330,32390,84,300,13071,1,323,279,5569,505,220,16,320,1962,520,682,8,311,220,20,320,1225,1790,570,198,198,334,82360,25,220,17,13,20,14,20,334,198,198,791,19114,596,1984,374,14738,40661,11,719,1070,527,1063,44667,430,5471,433,505,1694,810,7524,627,198,53957,82,1473,9,578,19114,16696,311,16988,279,10877,449,264,4443,50750,1295,323,5829,87068,7766,1093,31768,1105,3573,67,17060,10610,3531,951,7591,64635,909,311,1304,872,1984,810,1375,15436,13,198,9,2435,3493,1063,3649,922,279,5557,814,2351,57515,11,1778,439,330,75,6,8727,
