{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T22:31:24.095376076Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would give the speech a score of 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using logical reasoning and providing concrete examples to illustrate their points. The speaker's argument is well-structured, starting with a clear introduction that sets the stage for the rest of the speech. They then present their main idea - that there needs to be a unified approach to recognizing civil status across Europe - and provide evidence to support this claim. The speaker also addresses potential counterarguments by acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the need to balance individual freedoms with state sovereignty.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the speech could benefit from more specific examples or data to further illustrate the problems caused by the current system. Additionally, some listeners may find the language used to be slightly too technical or legalistic at times, which might make it harder for non-experts to follow along.\n\nOverall, however, I believe the speaker makes a compelling case and effectively conveys their message.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,34447,1744,20272,12,6853,409,19189,265,3869,28800,95199,268,949,14465,36731,16422,17194,1880,503,34155,9964,22011,3625,52314,8431,82,13,27058,9189,11,3900,841,274,6,74972,3738,1133,1744,409,4382,16287,13109,23541,13,2998,59157,13109,11,3625,52314,8431,82,11,272,17771,14707,5636,1744,39043,13,356,17771,326,6,49575,951,1180,288,7930,3613,68495,15265,17536,409,15265,4415,24918,55398,81991,15265,10237,13,3298,68,409,4415,24918,11,409,89360,11,409,35881,12416,11,272,17771,15265,48454,294,6,1748,13109,16422,307,2428,1765,1208,88265,15132,1672,38096,82,26725,3625,97222,1744,9189,47592,1645,9383,16968,8065,1317,409,15265,17536,13,33150,19910,409,326,6,33758,95199,26193,11,1880,5636,46680,969,1001,7010,514,38900,1218,1291,11,272,17771,64079,5019,841,6502,23761,11,841,15132,6502,42345,978,8637,81235,312,5259,355,294,22827,14240,266,653,47838,13,12095,9189,35881,579,89,409,30517,261,3625,4156,59307,11,5019,9189,44152,27584,27138,5019,4046,81,3212,7010,653,47838,21935,11,653,14240,266,3930,62321,409,829,5945,424,467,295,978,11,5019,653,2098,355,978,409,16456,3458,66014,653,1180,68,11,66021,934,35329,841,8024,6502,3869,829,83187,82291,13,2998,1794,2727,11,7010,3846,21935,11,26317,97222,78871,41518,355,13,41621,308,58736,1601,1339,5636,16422,307,81235,13,452,6,24677,402,52009,6824,68,3869,14240,664,1291,27750,96642,15082,1880,9071,10333,409,88817,9211,6316,3738,68,38793,951,83229,86709,409,64079,13,27058,51913,2058,11,653,13088,373,11826,11,12985,978,665,9822,11,1208,282,9011,1557,817,11,11083,91806,1439,11,409,409,43406,13088,373,3930,37194,11,41079,51084,665,1708,3516,24812,13,2998,37622,1744,16422,17194,11,503,34155,951,704,8839,3869,7643,46096,13,11876,45593,2655,367,3916,11,3625,83229,70,91555,95199,729,11,3625,18027,5512,11,3625,35881,6948,409,1208,6377,409,12437,409,326,6,33758,95199,26193,11,3625,94527,7546,288,409,1208,6377,95199,26193,11,951,97222,409,326,6,87713,13,8242,3625,447,37907,11,4864,296,53149,84,648,5019,27389,4120,3625,97222,3930,6681,2303,268,95199,268,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,10045,261,2192,27584,6316,6425,13509,1604,13,27058,62998,841,6502,75831,653,1180,68,5016,1765,514,43014,87264,1672,38096,11,665,14902,9952,3625,29124,83,1900,11,951,97222,21901,2908,12249,11,7930,841,92215,56316,23761,1323,285,665,5353,13,1252,1180,68,294,57286,266,8431,95199,268,13,34447,55455,308,17771,28068,978,11,1880,22299,653,4046,447,31059,265,17194,11,503,49152,685,665,88817,11943,514,77411,4046,447,31059,265,9465,294,22827,81337,11,3625,1218,32029,951,29124,83,1900,1880,409,326,49455,265,11,1208,22848,978,951,23496,355,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,279,8982,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,20406,33811,323,8405,14509,10507,311,41468,872,3585,13,578,19114,596,5811,374,1664,12,52243,11,6041,449,264,2867,17219,430,7437,279,6566,369,279,2800,315,279,8982,13,2435,1243,3118,872,1925,4623,482,430,1070,3966,311,387,264,43790,5603,311,49183,8431,2704,4028,4606,482,323,3493,6029,311,1862,420,3802,13,578,19114,1101,14564,4754,5663,16774,555,61708,279,23965,315,279,4360,323,279,1205,311,8335,3927,61077,449,1614,47059,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,4832,5573,374,430,279,8982,1436,8935,505,810,3230,10507,477,828,311,4726,41468,279,5435,9057,555,279,1510,1887,13,23212,11,1063,24475,1253,1505,279,4221,1511,311,387,10284,2288,11156,477,5897,4633,520,3115,11,902,2643,1304,433,16127,369,2536,18882,15916,311,1833,3235,627,198,28589,11,4869,11,358,4510,279,19114,3727,264,29722,1162,323,13750,390,50369,872,1984,13,128009],"total_duration":7607255234,"load_duration":197848,"prompt_eval_count":657,"prompt_eval_duration":1301042000,"eval_count":207,"eval_duration":6305392000}
