Is it effectively crafting a convincing message?\n\nSCALE: Given that this is an evaluation of the instructions, not a speech, I think the scale should be from 1=not clear to 5=very clear.\n\nTASK: [Given only one number as an answer - based on the scale described]\n\nScore: 4 (The instructions are generally clear and easy to follow.
