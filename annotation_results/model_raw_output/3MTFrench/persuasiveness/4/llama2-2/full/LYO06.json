The speaker presents their argument in a clear and structured manner, starting with an attention-grabbing hook and ending with a call to action. They also provide some evidence and examples to support their claims.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the reasoning could be more rigorous. For instance, the speaker's assertion that \"nobody comes from the countryside\" is not entirely accurate, as many people do come from rural areas. Additionally, the speaker could have provided more specific examples of how the action public could help to reestablish continuity in the ecological corridor.\n\nOverall, while the speech presents a convincing argument, there is room for improvement in terms of rigorous reasoning and evidence-based support.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,10014,2190,7187,24290,353,518,29871,1459,2460,7890,2257,29627,29892,432,29915,326,22094,712,7890,29871,22730,20081,29892,4875,707,21617,29884,427,11510,307,29892,427,3593,29892,2123,427,3147,698,262,2353,29889,3938,329,29899,5474,6701,316,3681,29892,427,4239,26893,29892,427,323,22928,29892,274,29915,342,5246,29889,1459,8474,29892,1444,26099,544,9061,818,610,631,712,26744,29871,1654,452,325,993,316,425,289,473,29890,283,280,29889,2581,301,29915,1794,22577,289,18041,1943,868,4158,361,6555,1750,452,24722,2298,1209,29948,782,640,5270,29889,853,20744,29892,7814,17631,4620,4110,17631,3906,553,22035,5313,1973,14458,13876,634,18165,29876,1379,29889,8748,1354,274,29915,342,325,17016,1671,8556,29892,966,3165,2708,29892,274,29915,342,325,17016,5695,1671,966,3778,2993,29889,1954,22094,29920,610,17488,13180,13545,832,1934,712,7890,29871,22730,1437,14836,29889,838,11867,29892,8532,2779,19882,29892,7890,452,7890,289,3498,29920,2331,427,3147,698,262,2353,19507,14090,1190,553,3147,16461,12935,29892,3503,7890,427,544,10281,553,2665,4285,23734,743,2123,7890,480,573,29920,553,904,5547,1671,7890,1437,13974,2265,29889,6803,7890,29892,1465,26814,13386,316,289,436,267,29892,966,5039,7719,3165,13116,29892,301,29915,25006,4371,29892,2123,301,29915,524,575,2450,29892,301,29915,351,2200,12896,13855,2689,966,4760,1446,1750,7890,3435,7853,519,634,301,29915,6698,743,720,29948,21553,1387,1750,19172,296,316,966,337,4926,29889,1720,269,29915,23121,8532,316,534,8885,553,6851,1671,19397,19172,276,316,1841,3891,29880,381,5278,3133,2131,904,21553,1387,29889,951,17889,316,611,266,17449,427,5646,29871,4277,29892,274,29915,342,270,29915,932,9555,553,17043,790,2925,1190,425,9927,3165,9874,316,7015,6851,29889,341,1004,7561,29881,29892,301,29915,26739,362,634,301,29915,264,339,9061,29889,6803,301,29915,26739,362,29892,1444,28511,1671,1841,13094,553,1044,11620,1750,1539,29873,296,443,29871,19898,7015,6851,1671,8689,966,1444,1314,316,19397,29889,6803,301,29915,264,339,9061,29892,1444,966,1006,307,1173,9411,4348,27751,1671,7015,11382,1575,782,9426,29889,1459,17488,29892,14034,29920,1597,6815,3814,9221,23249,274,16555,2606,1908,29892,12796,1318,610,4239,784,1475,363,11521,5908,29889,997,289,4070,29892,712,7890,29871,22730,29892,263,3008,28230,316,27962,316,301,29915,1540,818,301,29915,18288,29889,1105,361,712,18097,7890,18331,29920,782,13222,29892,7890,19643,29920,16731,439,29915,309,302,29915,29891,263,2331,21394,316,904,5547,1671,7890,274,11665,7628,316,26814,13310,1318,29889,11948,7890,29871,22730,19872,1314,29892,1444,454,29758,6079,29892,7890,7890,28905,29920,18097,6701,29889,1174,1791,424,18097,6701,3479,946,1759,29892,634,7890,8992,29920,6079,18836,29892,1559,21975,454,13222,7890,6454,15325,1190,443,9221,12906,371,332,1750,7890,6309,29889,10016,288,23270,29892,29871,4277,8164,7848,330,5512,749,818,17103,270,29915,1540,610,3729,663,316,29892,3503,980,1702,13871,712,425,14326,1436,749,1671,427,337,9018,357,29889,838,943,29892,432,29915,1794,8164,29899,5474,1841,1579,17192,381,29889,9194,280,1875,29892,7890,1671,2146,573,29920,26814,26786,1190,443,17887,2665,631,1045,11728,29892,7890,867,4895,29920,782,14858,28667,711,29948,29889,751,392,5646,818,17103,29892,7890,29271,346,13325,782,658,262,553,521,5793,1295,29889,3674,29892,18916,29892,7890,5246,267,2331,966,4439,1144,868,17103,29889,11948,7890,7890,19643,29920,325,568,16731,1750,3435,10259,4211,743,270,29915,21264,362,316,13047,316,425,5469,29889,8748,439,29915,309,1841,1579,17192,5582,21285,634,6314,19882,29892,3479,1095,307,1169,966,2298,11406,7844,29892,1671,19397,337,9018,357,553,28125,324,271,29948,279,1169,29899,517,29875,29889,390,465,332,29948,29892,7890,6773,29920,1437,506,271,882,634,2313,29878,23855,882,1224,425,301,275,5289,316,425,363,11992,634,7890,18331,29920,316,26814,21384,29889,360,29915,348,1775,262,29892,454,8182,275,882,316,301,29915,24031,553,427,1324,1314,8288,712,316,14984,966,19313,316,301,29915,24031,553,1044,11620,5932,743,29892,592,14924,818,425,10098,270,29915,932,9555,553,17043,790,2925,1190,425,16987,427,29871,19898,316,301,29915,2467,2529,9854,427,3444,29889,8748,8648,29892,553,25179,787,267,3022,29878,21017,634,1015,10500,29876,4999,1671,966,1044,11620,1180,2993,29889,28079,29871,4277,1671,439,29915,585,2186,29892,7890,29892,289,4070,29892,7890,2653,790,26477,1020,369,643,26814,3814,29889,11948,782,29899,6144,30001,29892,301,29915,24031,868,27264,484,13019,2653,5582,3911,5695,1020,369,643,5278,3814,29892,2123,6701,1601,357,818,3681,29892,634,6701,269,29915,309,427,263,8829,347,29892,8019,553,3581,369,1372,454,4158,361,6555,29889,4514,29871,317,5454,1307,11759,17185,515,29871,29896,29922,1333,472,599,304,29871,29945,29922,1201,1568,29889,4514,4571,29924,1430,13381,11759,797,596,9426,29892,920,20408,294,573,338,278,12032,297,445,1301,924,29892,474,29889,29872,1696,437,278,2022,17583,25554,263,17953,3277,2643,29973,1317,1009,24481,12912,2065
