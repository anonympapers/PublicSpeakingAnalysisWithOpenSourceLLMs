They use vivid imagery and metaphors to convey the gravity of the situation, such as \"Les coups de ma track des SS-plops sur les échines courbées\" (\"The blows from my tracks [as in, the sound of footsteps] of the SS on bowed shoulders\"). This creates a powerful emotional connection with the audience.\n\nThe speaker also uses rhetorical devices like repetition (e.g., \"Je n'arrive pas en tendre les cris... Je n'ai entendu encore que le silence\") to emphasize the impact of their message. Additionally, they highlight the importance of remembering and honoring the victims by saying \"Ces hommes-là, ils ne sont pas vraiment mort. Ils existent.\"\n\nOverall, the speaker's passion, sincerity, and ability to convey complex emotions through storytelling make their speech persuasive and engaging.\n\n**Dimension: Persuasiveness**\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message that is meant to persuade the audience to care about the topic and remember the victims of historical events. The reasoning is rigorous because it is grounded in personal experience and emotional connection, making it more relatable and impactful.\n\n**Task:** Based on the provided transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of this speech as 5 (very much) on a scale from 1 to 5.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,757,5945,10176,729,294,31109,17571,951,9734,70,1572,3869,468,14643,13,622,34155,4635,84,48488,409,48577,7010,7643,17536,13,5034,628,455,472,294,6,306,969,25108,645,15132,10237,288,13,11876,46106,11,4864,3625,16796,824,1072,66021,1744,4864,308,34155,6502,15925,1208,5457,409,30517,261,1208,56949,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,55162,10036,30517,261,20662,85059,13,622,34155,55162,10036,60946,265,87320,220,868,220,931,28408,65832,84764,1188,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,3625,447,37907,29449,20545,13,37211,2182,89,11,90053,409,17317,11,9189,326,6,306,73602,11,90053,409,17317,3900,379,264,514,21847,13,62463,53542,41518,355,7010,3625,757,484,2439,409,326,6,90446,13,81245,14848,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,951,29135,409,20545,13,5034,2385,11,514,42775,1826,3869,51010,16167,7010,3625,1841,462,31539,13,11876,4020,1725,409,7643,3839,951,18679,2320,54789,1765,3625,4046,331,1572,2126,65,14014,13,11876,2107,2469,1765,688,3625,3355,3145,11,10071,46152,841,834,64,1188,55455,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,934,85217,5320,29580,71686,23589,265,653,47838,9880,13,12623,11,503,34155,326,6,69068,27750,46681,409,326,6,90446,1880,5636,503,34155,1208,12155,8047,13,14465,308,6,1138,535,6502,665,8541,265,3625,60053,11,3625,1043,747,14295,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,14465,308,34155,69379,84,35597,1744,514,21847,13,1708,1105,11,4864,757,36731,259,3514,978,5553,1208,60642,14081,1598,13,19421,272,17771,28463,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,8666,978,951,2960,33903,1880,951,2960,33903,294,6,283,19456,425,1765,1208,7591,403,367,28408,31037,13,7695,296,59858,1323,554,1339,3869,1647,16536,4618,11,272,17771,7591,403,978,13,6178,72,11,4864,841,348,11206,2852,6502,1744,7643,17475,8047,11,3846,1744,7643,17475,8047,11,3846,1744,4864,308,34155,11,3846,17475,3125,1765,326,39982,9769,23774,409,326,6,1111,13,622,34155,93974,11,1880,503,34155,93974,27750,6959,13,622,34155,6463,4502,35597,11,35597,11,294,49455,265,2199,13,43987,26178,11,46152,15132,39015,13,622,34155,2579,292,258,978,3625,326,4558,85,417,11,503,34155,2579,292,258,978,3625,20043,2249,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,81245,15132,409,1055,355,32118,69,417,7010,6316,4046,10946,409,11939,11,409,30481,11,1744,1208,60642,14081,1598,757,29557,83,1339,13,622,34155,3625,4043,1155,1339,7010,3625,46496,13,7695,296,6,546,44314,978,13,622,6,25632,12339,68226,9189,20028,97448,75804,88253,11,7643,11939,5019,3846,42775,13,356,17771,653,42775,13,14465,5534,2852,294,6,1132,978,38469,60642,76743,556,13,7695,6824,68,11,9189,514,23933,10333,11,3846,21847,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,6233,648,409,514,1437,12329,13,622,34155,6233,648,409,69241,9779,514,21847,1370,951,78199,13,19421,26725,3625,78199,7930,757,296,6,2706,306,665,757,77065,3869,326,6,461,4618,11,26725,3625,78199,1744,4864,41380,7010,27750,10083,598,11,503,34155,6233,648,409,3625,22641,261,294,6,370,541,665,41091,1880,76826,409,9189,3625,20028,97448,13,62463,53542,2922,6496,11,46152,841,15132,6502,60019,10237,13,81245,3073,306,13,81245,15132,7010,29449,69067,13,81245,15132,7010,3625,47289,6489,625,1154,13,81245,15132,7010,26725,3625,78199,7930,3625,14848,326,6,434,1155,13,34447,6666,11,38494,685,13,62463,76145,15132,46874,5512,19443,404,11,15878,1744,54613,841,274,41901,264,716,20822,81541,13,19421,45575,11,39043,87264,34561,3904,3846,38838,409,3197,11,1437,285,519,20662,4046,54761,1088,12,67380,11,45602,887,978,447,8047,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,3984,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,11263,1473,9,9,7092,25,220,20,320,1225,1790,33395,198,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,11821,872,4443,3217,323,21958,5552,311,279,8712,13,2435,1005,43120,41545,323,31768,1105,311,20599,279,24128,315,279,6671,11,1778,439,330,24641,4020,1725,409,7643,3839,951,18679,2320,54789,1765,3625,4046,331,1572,2126,65,14014,1,3573,791,46303,505,856,14242,510,300,304,11,279,5222,315,60802,60,315,279,18679,389,85473,28004,1865,1115,11705,264,8147,14604,3717,449,279,10877,627,198,791,19114,1101,5829,87068,7766,1093,54515,320,68,13,70,2637,330,30854,308,6,1138,535,6502,665,8541,265,3625,60053,1131,14465,308,34155,69379,84,35597,1744,514,21847,909,311,47032,279,5536,315,872,1984,13,23212,11,814,11415,279,12939,315,48384,323,79025,279,12697,555,5605,330,34,288,53542,2922,6496,11,46152,841,15132,6502,60019,10237,13,81245,3073,306,1210,198,198,28589,11,279,19114,596,11939,11,100226,11,323,5845,311,20599,6485,219
