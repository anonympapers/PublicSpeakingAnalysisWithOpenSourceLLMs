{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T20:08:19.243418556Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would give a score of 4 out of 5 for the persuasive speech.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by:\n\n1. Starting with an engaging anecdote about a child using a tablet, which sets the tone for the rest of the speech.\n2. Clearly articulating the consequences of poorly designed technology on workers' mental and physical well-being.\n3. Providing specific examples from their research, such as the example of Peugeot workers struggling to adapt to new robotized tools.\n4. Offering practical solutions to improve the design of these tools, making them more intuitive and user-friendly.\n5. Showcasing their expertise by mentioning their observations and filming of operators at work.\n\nHowever, I would deduct one point because the speech could be even more effective if it included:\n\n1. More concrete data or statistics to support the claims about the negative impacts of poorly designed technology on workers' well-being.\n2. A clearer call to action for the audience, such as specific steps they can take to promote better design in their own organizations.\n\nOverall, I believe the speaker presents a compelling and thought-provoking argument that effectively persuades the audience to consider the importance of designing intuitive and user-friendly technology.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1744,20272,653,36963,33632,519,42676,389,25400,2322,6316,21354,668,7010,3625,69236,5019,1208,43905,55133,37291,13,61651,14707,25945,100198,11,3900,20272,3846,13033,68,13,5034,21354,668,1826,19227,1001,97301,333,1744,27584,653,33632,519,7930,308,26248,56316,24560,665,3729,9952,1208,1391,1466,1762,665,1685,593,9888,276,42625,13,356,17771,22299,4502,514,272,5976,2933,1880,1208,2869,38469,97958,6935,65,462,447,5512,11,22299,4502,3900,66517,1339,48901,294,22827,16968,13,5034,5780,1826,45575,514,33482,1133,409,326,77025,40807,13,46408,3698,1395,514,71132,11,27549,514,69241,332,84868,479,13,12095,1208,2869,38469,1826,14707,2267,635,11,27549,25692,39587,409,43406,653,45165,23349,961,97820,5019,326,6,87713,13,34447,1744,3846,1522,275,45575,11,87158,3625,12933,841,15132,6502,4502,97301,22589,1744,39043,13,3489,37907,15132,3625,1615,978,45045,1765,15265,4197,13109,949,29179,3457,3625,4860,1744,4864,757,17477,7010,11083,88817,8696,13,38891,89,5392,788,1370,51173,1744,9189,62299,1200,978,7853,324,1765,3625,523,4558,4978,409,97044,46206,5250,94522,1880,1744,20662,5780,274,17771,6502,6316,21354,668,11,10071,1208,17536,513,274,49455,12585,285,8047,9952,1208,88265,9189,3567,74466,5155,261,10071,8941,514,1400,5741,1826,294,31109,3930,35019,339,2727,13,33150,5636,259,35657,11,514,1400,5741,409,26633,3930,35019,339,2727,1370,81645,45441,50026,220,4728,1400,41476,409,3930,35019,339,2727,1370,9880,13,19421,14707,45575,11,4502,15265,348,1082,817,308,17771,6502,95234,11,1370,97301,333,11,6502,51794,3869,75144,11,4502,27549,308,17771,6502,514,33482,1133,409,15265,1560,40807,11,9189,47592,26633,10105,13,5034,55133,11,9189,45366,58673,15610,40970,83457,13,34447,7010,6316,93486,22299,653,28800,9880,11,6316,81645,46777,2132,42463,13,43359,607,1001,12,37526,308,17771,39587,6502,60019,6316,3072,13,5034,513,95959,6425,13,19421,665,20272,11,1208,86806,11,272,17771,1744,9189,5276,74466,15265,76407,409,58673,15610,13,9605,9189,39732,74466,8065,52962,1133,409,15265,704,321,11,10071,20662,18475,264,653,16081,19329,275,333,13,3341,20662,37291,11,272,17771,9189,7930,12584,89,409,35573,3698,1565,1880,1208,7015,483,409,15265,704,321,13,41621,12584,89,409,35573,296,17060,269,12329,951,44827,1880,23761,52309,333,8065,40970,409,9517,66,26803,5019,379,945,404,8065,5636,83457,13,350,35657,2442,412,569,11,3846,16081,19329,275,333,11,264,28800,3625,10405,11540,3916,13,27713,3242,2540,15265,14707,85815,1880,15265,5178,13,41621,12584,89,27584,25692,85815,8065,25646,294,22827,4545,665,436,5615,424,1208,85434,1880,594,25526,404,951,25595,77660,39929,326,98279,4099,294,93825,1765,5794,8047,13,41621,12584,89,28463,20028,951,56549,1759,6033,14707,951,79165,26317,60404,3869,326,31769,56745,11,1370,51173,13,9995,265,3869,4196,11,272,17771,409,20028,665,80444,1744,46206,5250,94522,20662,6900,11540,1604,45441,16961,8047,87451,1208,43656,951,1772,288,13,27058,39043,11,503,6,49133,3625,1200,978,7853,1759,9465,653,42775,1880,4864,3625,98896,11,503,6,44803,325,28130,52962,1133,1880,503,6,1748,57609,951,15082,39723,3900,29253,653,4046,11707,9465,514,52962,1133,951,12933,1880,3625,9604,265,951,1200,978,7853,1759,13,3959,15082,39723,3625,1200,978,7853,1759,97569,20028,653,5149,82113,42625,12267,5019,274,6,20311,3869,28130,704,321,13,2998,5589,11,4864,30714,951,10105,5019,1744,3625,348,1082,4881,12585,285,5512,1880,46106,704,8839,69125,3567,72,89810,409,45165,1018,4893,70175,294,41901,69,1821,22299,20662,21354,668,13,2998,294,81979,4751,288,11,503,34155,13458,16968,71357,10253,1200,978,7853,1759,409,64032,466,6316,3930,35019,339,2727,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,369,279,66343,8982,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,512,198,16,13,28757,449,459,23387,50750,1295,922,264,1716,1701,264,21354,11,902,7437,279,16630,369,279,2800,315,279,8982,13,198,17,13,54504,28664,15853,279,16296,315,31555,6319,5557,389,7487,6,10723,323,7106,1664,33851,13,198,18,13,81200,3230,10507,505,872,3495,11,1778,439,279,3187,315,5250,94522,7487,20558,311,10737,311,502,12585,1534,7526,13,198,19,13,67118,15325,10105,311,7417,279,2955,315,1521,7526,11,3339,1124,810,42779,323,1217,22658,13,198,20,13,7073,66,4522,872,19248,555,45391,872,24654,323,39970,315,20197,520,990,627,198,11458,11,358,1053,37910,832,1486,1606,279,8982,1436,387,1524,810,7524,422,433,5343,512,198,16,13,4497,14
