They start by setting up a common human experience (searching for light in the dark) and then gradually build upon it to introduce their research topic. The use of everyday objects like sugar and fabric makes the concept more accessible and intriguing.\n\nThe reasoning is also rigorous, as the speaker takes the audience through their thought process, from identifying the phenomenon to exploring its potential applications. They provide concrete examples and demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms.\n\nHowever, I deduct one point because some parts of the speech feel a bit informal or casual, which may not be suitable for all audiences or contexts. Additionally, some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for better clarity. Nonetheless, overall, the speaker presents their ideas in an engaging and convincing manner that effectively communicates their message to the audience.\n\nScore:
