They use simple language to explain complex medical concepts, making it easy for the audience to understand. The speaker also provides specific examples and anecdotes that illustrate their points, which makes the information more relatable and memorable.\n\nThe reasoning is rigorous, with the speaker providing a clear explanation of the importance of understanding thrombosis and its mechanisms. They also share their own research experience and challenges, which adds credibility to their argument.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give it a perfect score because there are moments where the speech feels a bit too technical or detailed, which might be lost on non-experts in the field. Additionally, some parts of the speech could benefit from more emphasis on the emotional impact of the issue or more concrete examples of how this research can improve people's lives.\n\nOverall, I think the speaker does an excellent job of conveying their passion and expertise, making a strong case for the importance of understanding thrombosis.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2009,2046,13368,62891,11,503,34155,22641,978,1208,47276,409,7643,94721,1097,648,13,19421,503,34155,6502,18757,59394,409,85453,66021,1744,514,4848,3381,24560,293,3102,978,13,622,34155,5945,3532,978,514,1488,10367,665,36252,278,11,503,34155,9517,63353,13,14465,5553,2192,6316,293,2182,4618,409,7591,65,24889,3869,326,31769,61673,11,55455,3869,20028,13,46706,1208,17536,11,4864,36731,958,818,665,71546,5673,648,64603,13,3206,99568,3675,11,272,17771,409,7591,65,24889,3625,117111,12249,3930,34922,2854,467,11,27549,1826,348,11178,13,3489,438,6316,348,11178,1826,293,3102,8047,11,1370,653,2211,484,354,409,29340,11,389,22011,934,80720,1826,65636,79548,8047,11,389,841,25692,6502,2961,5615,466,514,29340,409,4319,8646,13,7695,274,6,40031,1130,11,3900,1589,8047,409,326,6,8039,97692,11,951,25595,77660,11,1370,37291,27584,951,40852,14295,11,7930,841,274,59858,934,1468,306,6502,1880,951,5107,5512,3869,1208,15572,68,13,2998,4606,11,46777,76132,11,272,17771,220,18,220,931,80080,48577,7930,82133,23761,9604,265,20662,8811,329,648,13,39783,348,11178,11,272,17771,665,117111,2933,11,10071,272,17771,665,117111,2933,7930,1826,18434,519,11,7930,11412,9517,351,404,42676,3900,1826,293,3102,978,13,7695,11412,379,39929,951,1343,98078,4558,4978,294,52152,1658,27279,13,12103,4046,52279,13109,11412,62439,13,356,17771,3869,13510,829,23878,13109,3869,513,7591,35627,15878,513,272,34858,13,19421,26725,27750,1343,98078,4558,4978,11,934,54386,917,6853,514,14322,2727,409,1208,4864,30872,265,77851,2249,11,15132,75804,88253,28800,4635,355,11,10071,76776,28800,14240,664,1291,13,2582,4502,389,841,829,275,6502,4068,39043,15572,68,11,1880,3399,389,841,25692,6502,779,78756,13,356,17771,22299,7010,7643,13081,38672,2201,556,11,4502,272,17771,514,649,569,7930,1826,44180,978,11,272,17771,6502,514,7591,65,3102,519,12046,579,7930,11412,296,26248,1814,13,27058,68226,14240,664,1291,20662,8811,329,648,11,4864,841,94297,6502,58673,15610,2167,1133,1765,326,6,87713,13,622,34155,63669,294,22827,83597,18434,519,11,7930,45441,409,62827,1880,409,32118,4919,44618,92892,12339,13,3206,46494,409,38317,1826,39587,409,75831,829,65636,8461,77851,817,11,503,34155,514,390,331,263,5019,68226,326,57286,664,1291,13,14465,56445,3869,3429,66014,3625,76488,1760,511,1286,11,4068,75831,6316,65636,8461,7930,45441,92892,12339,11,3869,3846,7930,513,39904,46206,326,6,87713,11,4068,514,390,331,263,11412,9517,351,404,11,4068,22842,3846,2211,484,354,4046,12821,96559,1880,3698,3675,409,27138,13,27058,39043,11,503,34155,4046,20609,42625,25774,11,503,34155,3729,978,294,81979,4046,447,9100,665,9822,11,3869,326,31769,376,4091,13,14465,42775,273,9952,3625,45165,466,258,17724,13,622,34155,1296,978,1880,312,1296,978,514,1760,511,1286,1765,951,348,33903,1989,1104,72,2053,13,622,34155,5906,8065,1486,665,1760,511,1286,7930,1826,13726,665,44496,333,11,272,17771,3869,13510,13,42215,45441,514,40970,9781,372,3689,519,3284,13,9424,4458,308,17771,54312,1744,503,34155,89175,11,503,34155,281,76366,6316,348,8511,8065,53052,3930,16081,11,6316,348,8511,8065,53052,3930,628,56564,48099,13,4366,27750,26633,1046,12416,11,503,49152,685,653,26938,1744,4864,91507,64592,1517,261,5019,48908,8065,5636,436,278,402,48099,1880,8065,83259,503,41901,585,68,409,1208,65636,47661,13,1252,89244,7930,4642,1208,1080,351,2987,13,19421,503,6,1617,1438,1744,514,6225,513,5276,68,8065,2211,484,354,13,12623,16177,2442,57375,7643,2024,3833,273,30,19421,39043,11,653,84751,13,14465,64290,2852,6316,348,8511,4684,4558,79507,65636,79548,8047,13,3206,390,331,263,272,17771,25945,14707,9517,588,484,978,13,7695,264,15925,951,95146,11,3900,264,15925,951,6348,3833,645,11,10071,4864,44829,79196,52424,20662,13651,409,348,8511,5019,326,57286,21178,8065,8162,1355,2474,13,7695,379,264,951,94499,13,7695,379,264,15925,45889,36505,11,3900,264,15925,45889,4046,87231,1892,552,11,10071,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,38831,2979,15610,11,35597,1880,35597,514,1760,511,1286,1826,16961,978,13,921,20234,86919,13,33150,1620,11,503,34155,84788,72,3869,48021,8065,1486,653,83597,7930,45441,22514,68,11,7930,45441,312,3107,1260,1880,7930,29557,409,75831,6316,65636,79548,8047,348,8511,817,8065,57705,978,2889,2428,1675,10746,556,3869,274,69537,93533,8065,8348,69,9211,326,6,87713,13,11876,6954,4918,100246,294,6,29116,6729,20605,8135,1744,951,19266,45045,51625,5014,294,42069,265,1026,15132,2107,4893,294,6,16288,3625,40321,1821,3930,2211,484,354,11,7930,917,5169,79738,1880,7930,834,15138,79738,8065,45369,3930,27138,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,7010,514,18111,324,11,389,25692,6669,10670,934,6,2933,50087,274,65948,404,1339,42676,27584,11,389,35737,13171,409,27389,3826,326,6,6581,292,582,13109,409,76076,35030,292,24469,409,85722,71269,52760,5019,46777,11939,1880,665,92892,648,8065,3625,708,625,978,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1
