They also demonstrate a clear understanding of their topic and seem confident in their approach. Additionally, they provide concrete details about their experiments and the steps they're taking to optimize production.\n\nHowever, there are some moments where the speaker's reasoning becomes less rigorous, such as when they use vague terms like \"méta-désation\" without fully explaining what it means. Also, some of the phrases used (\"pour être méta-désation\", \"mon objectif est simple\") seem a bit too casual and might not be entirely convincing to some listeners.\n\nOverall, while there are some minor flaws in the speaker's delivery, they still present their message effectively, making me score their persuasiveness as 4 out of 5.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,65673,11,7643,1925,11,503,34155,6316,25626,48659,3869,9189,63991,3913,13,14465,91507,20028,6316,270,4558,325,1765,514,89714,951,7591,331,1441,13,2057,72,39015,11,60019,11,9964,44496,5916,261,8065,7591,331,1441,1880,272,17771,653,10484,14240,799,5019,39043,13,34447,27549,1826,11,1826,54312,1744,4864,51441,1028,9148,8646,1744,9964,439,1208,12155,978,13283,42676,6502,15878,77558,6316,281,13649,6853,30,14465,91507,9189,3327,72684,39723,1826,7643,1925,13,74656,97717,11,4864,514,2322,668,1208,1925,3869,1208,281,69628,11,272,17771,1515,2428,13,19421,281,18826,11,272,17771,1120,1133,5019,45602,1744,4864,77438,635,58673,15610,1765,20662,76680,8637,2428,13,16233,92622,9189,11,1744,1208,3682,13109,294,31769,339,978,331,1441,11,1744,17317,2558,19941,11,15132,665,282,788,2902,552,13,1708,1105,11,7930,92215,23761,14448,69068,4046,39624,10515,81235,1370,32118,2629,1773,5512,367,13,507,2005,11,10071,27549,1826,54312,934,17771,75249,1208,32118,2629,1773,5512,367,30,19421,14707,11,16968,71357,11,272,17771,4839,1133,3846,934,35329,513,39904,7010,29449,72601,21552,333,13,48109,60534,2439,11,17317,4170,978,26692,11,44829,17317,48041,275,2439,951,19637,645,1880,3930,56086,11,9952,514,43014,17317,17258,85,2439,2558,556,409,326,31769,64374,13,29179,321,6496,11,4068,503,34155,63991,51084,1647,70927,3869,11083,1370,7298,13,46706,12155,281,5599,37907,11,39043,76605,9189,3846,1744,326,54386,92215,296,57286,276,12329,13,19421,14707,11,3846,15132,26725,3625,7591,331,1441,2942,8467,11,9952,3625,2800,1900,38450,17724,11,6033,35597,3625,7558,2439,5945,484,5512,7930,841,56311,5636,23761,92465,5512,13,27058,57625,294,31109,887,8047,11,84364,409,1208,4647,12583,978,409,12155,281,5599,37907,11,5019,23761,23761,32118,2629,1773,5512,367,13,5783,434,519,11,308,17771,54312,6502,30,1221,846,79507,11,4864,42775,273,1765,951,1367,14081,3904,811,5019,9189,13510,11,3698,3675,409,32118,2629,1773,5512,367,17317,17258,85,2439,2558,556,9952,19227,6033,19227,7591,331,1441,13,2998,51092,11,503,6,19680,1082,20662,5788,13,27058,45602,11,4864,66517,58673,15610,11083,3539,5512,3869,1208,13826,25108,818,11,19227,83597,409,57128,13,40602,398,29150,1826,514,21134,3869,58673,15610,13,2998,51092,11,86100,3869,274,59858,294,6,11968,288,11,44829,3869,42067,297,4469,818,1880,665,5589,32118,2629,5392,540,4558,4978,11,7930,54206,514,32118,2629,5392,13,3206,1665,333,1826,4382,11,19227,29449,85424,11,58673,484,978,5636,5019,2558,556,5636,5019,342,40538,5636,13,2998,59157,13109,11,46777,3539,978,8024,3869,653,57951,409,293,533,978,4108,11,95917,359,9952,6316,34501,71269,52760,13,43987,26178,11,13085,89,5392,788,1744,79380,294,6,11968,288,45441,8811,1037,11,1744,3846,3347,547,11,65396,11,54613,841,25692,514,69241,9779,13,5034,5788,1826,2961,49530,8047,11,272,17771,5019,45602,11,1744,4864,7515,38966,3869,11083,3539,5512,951,4787,409,42775,23669,11,22299,653,1069,1557,26878,265,6033,6316,91317,10737,8047,13,27058,1913,404,11,4864,296,6,8039,19010,1082,514,16968,11,54401,409,9189,13510,11,3698,3675,409,32118,2629,5392,11,17317,17258,85,2439,2558,556,9952,326,6,49575,409,12155,7591,331,1441,2942,8467,5019,1744,12155,281,5599,37907,2558,285,306,326,31769,64374,409,2486,467,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,1375,15436,10507,320,884,45252,3823,74502,311,12571,6514,8,323,39686,279,4754,7720,315,872,3495,13,2435,1101,20461,264,2867,8830,315,872,8712,323,2873,16913,304,872,5603,13,23212,11,814,3493,14509,3649,922,872,21896,323,279,7504,814,2351,4737,311,30536,5788,627,198,11458,11,1070,527,1063,14269,1405,279,19114,596,33811,9221,2753,47999,11,1778,439,994,814,1005,40146,3878,1093,330,102843,2629,1773,5512,367,1,2085,7373,26073,1148,433,3445,13,7429,11,1063,315,279,32847,1511,3573,55619,23761,32118,2629,1773,5512,367,498,330,1677,1665,333,1826,4382,909,2873,264,2766,2288,16736,323,2643,539,387,11622,40661,311,1063,24475,627,198,28589,11,1418,1070,527,1063,9099,41859,304,279,19114,596,9889,11,814,2103,3118,872,1984,13750,11,3339,757,5573,872,24613,300,13071,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,13,128009],"total_duration":47426160816,"load_duration":152305,"prompt_eval_count":773,"prompt_eval_duration":3418766000,"eval_count":200,"eval_duration":44006840000}
