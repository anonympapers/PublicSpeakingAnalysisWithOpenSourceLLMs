{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T19:59:53.24732251Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would give a score of 2 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning seems somewhat unclear and scattered throughout the speech. The use of metaphors and analogies to explain complex concepts is interesting, but they can be difficult to follow. The speaker also repeats themselves several times, which may make it harder for the audience to stay engaged and focused.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker jumps abruptly from talking about materials science to discussing personal experiences and emotions. This shift in tone and topic may confuse or disorient some listeners.\n\nOverall, while the speaker has some interesting ideas and insights, their delivery and message are not particularly convincing or rigorous.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,19610,45325,46939,33614,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,274,31769,1215,588,949,41621,12584,89,757,13510,653,5634,28154,2933,514,1156,10610,12339,650,4880,64,6033,3900,294,69537,541,11,10071,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,934,41901,20272,11,653,5634,28154,2933,87158,1208,24408,3757,273,409,27138,326,6,21201,11,272,17771,653,3738,4545,1880,5019,23761,15522,318,8047,22299,17317,11,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,6178,72,11,1370,51173,11,3900,379,264,653,4545,8065,1647,708,321,294,49455,337,5890,1880,294,6,1617,306,519,11,4864,282,37093,11,4864,1332,12339,11,503,6,4683,1497,653,5634,28154,2933,1880,326,6,9600,547,28463,11,3900,513,36709,1880,3900,513,95159,554,13,34447,87320,4864,9189,1370,273,409,16968,39043,949,4366,346,1744,41091,11,503,34155,9964,22011,11,4864,52895,375,653,35462,8791,458,1661,78129,934,31109,29557,409,27389,35573,514,20607,321,294,49455,337,5890,1880,514,1486,409,89869,294,22827,43453,5634,28154,2933,7930,9129,5808,514,10095,265,1880,1208,60172,294,31769,85,354,554,409,18111,324,13,46706,514,9511,67763,11,4864,42775,273,11,934,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,11,503,58736,30532,653,46110,4411,346,2933,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,4864,514,66517,18434,265,7010,653,50026,40280,39723,9189,45366,9189,38831,15170,9952,15265,81645,7010,76076,21935,11,653,7591,23772,326,6,28400,307,13109,13,4418,66,11,4864,296,1441,7010,326,93847,1880,1744,66517,326,93847,11,1208,4160,953,11,1208,7930,8175,265,11,27549,281,46651,1880,27549,281,46651,1880,1744,66517,326,6,35940,977,648,2933,1880,514,31807,17194,11,3900,308,41901,25692,5636,11,44829,1208,24408,3757,273,409,39674,5890,1880,8065,25646,294,22827,3738,4545,11,3900,46141,593,13,14465,5320,2249,13510,11,3900,95159,554,8065,5636,259,35657,11,3900,19748,265,2856,554,11,66021,1744,39043,841,513,4160,275,6502,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,11,1208,95159,554,11,66021,1744,326,49455,2428,1744,4864,52895,375,757,29557,2221,294,6,14283,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,25945,38920,409,326,6,541,265,409,8162,1474,7211,265,54401,409,757,7591,5192,404,26725,27750,1156,10610,10308,409,84364,13,34447,9604,10333,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,1744,39043,7010,1208,17536,11,66021,1744,665,5636,409,326,6,12828,307,13109,409,11323,266,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,60172,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,10095,265,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,60172,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,83256,15265,10095,265,1880,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,13,19421,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,11,10071,4864,9189,9517,73,830,12339,13,426,1116,11,9189,326,817,89,11,9189,514,8834,27843,978,1880,39015,11,3625,95159,1439,1081,27462,3869,513,46131,1880,1208,1913,308,17771,6502,25945,78060,13,1708,1105,11,4068,20028,949,356,17771,39015,1744,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,1647,704,321,86953,1188,9952,3625,4046,447,811,409,1208,38094,648,11,64441,1880,32118,4919,2428,1744,4864,1491,616,285,7010,1647,1515,78493,11,4864,94297,45347,409,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,3869,326,31769,331,6853,18563,2445,454,2428,54401,409,27389,35573,3869,26077,4545,3625,95159,1439,7930,3073,306,294,31109,76407,304,118904,15729,15890,653,5634,28154,2933,3567,72,89810,58612,486,4881,33670,934,22827,20156,841,513,2558,1082,11,66021,1744,41091,11,4864,5320,2249,1744,39043,1913,275,14707,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,17,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,596,33811,5084,14738,25420,323,38067,6957,279,8982,13,578,1005,315,31768,1105,323,24291,552,311,10552,6485,19476,374,7185,11,719,814,649,387,5107,311,1833,13,578,19114,1101,44694,5694,3892,3115,11,902,1253,1304,433,16127,369,279,10877,311,4822,17045,323,10968,627,198,50674,11,279,19114,35308,60845,505,7556,922,7384,8198,311,25394,4443,11704,323,21958,13,1115,6541,304,16630,323,8712,1253,59217,477,834,15226,1063,24475,627,198,28589,11,1418,279,19114,706,1063,7185,6848,323,26793,11,872,9889,323,1984,527,539,8104,40661,477,47999,13,128009],"total_duration":5445163137,"load_duration":207672,"prompt_eval_count":840,"prompt_eval_duration":1563816000,"eval_count":132,"eval_duration":3880436000}
