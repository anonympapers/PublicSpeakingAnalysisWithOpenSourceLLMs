This approach helps to build rapport and makes the audience more receptive to the rest of the message. The speaker then transitions into discussing their personal experience and how they believe that poor habits, such as overeating and lack of exercise, can lead to health problems like diabetes.\n\nThe speaker's use of storytelling and anecdotes (e.g., \"Fidurez-vous que ça m'a de deux villas et de plus en plus fréquent dans notre société\") helps to make the message more relatable and memorable. The speaker also uses rhetorical questions (\"Quand il y a quelques jours, le verdict est tombé.\") and vivid imagery (\"Il malheureusement, il entraîne de véritable déraînement dans fonctionnement dans nos ordonnements.\") to engage the audience.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the speech could benefit from more concrete evidence and data-driven arguments to support the speaker's claims. While the speaker mentions some statistics (e.g., \"près de 3 millions 800 000 variables\"), they do not provide specific examples or studies to back up their assertions.\n\nOverall, however, I believe that the speaker does an effective job of crafting a convincing message and persuading the audience to consider the importance of healthy habits in preventing diseases like diabetes.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,36684,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,75804,88253,11,503,6,2706,81356,9189,89504,3930,824,83353,301,13,9589,54312,934,35329,379,264,1370,8318,9189,951,47104,7930,14425,1188,6033,14848,23010,8065,824,83353,301,949,2998,16968,4865,11,41091,11,503,59858,14425,285,13,19421,4502,4864,348,11206,2852,9189,89504,3930,14707,75804,88253,11,272,17771,66021,1744,4864,296,41901,447,37093,48488,13,435,307,554,89,45325,42676,55668,265,62891,42138,20662,5954,77,8047,11,39043,3288,1339,27750,32118,331,24469,951,6117,5512,13,356,17771,653,259,15433,978,11,46939,14707,39723,39043,1370,273,949,3489,438,3900,379,264,45889,49301,11,514,36543,1826,44180,978,13,12103,32118,8332,258,25400,264,63991,51084,934,35329,264,3625,20028,3930,1891,370,66522,4502,40970,409,272,6009,8261,13,19421,97507,11,9189,841,73953,89,6502,1744,45347,3846,86323,3869,5363,261,1208,43116,11,8065,1647,503,41901,951,23317,1880,8065,18434,519,3930,39962,42844,1744,3625,220,23,8261,27389,1768,5512,78418,2933,11,43989,7970,7010,829,77323,13,435,307,554,89,45325,1744,39043,296,26248,409,26633,9077,300,1880,409,5636,665,5636,1448,978,17187,7010,29449,77824,13,7695,8811,75876,43765,11,3900,83786,25108,818,409,45165,23349,7591,969,25108,40280,7010,34501,40280,7010,12155,6141,27476,3808,13,7695,1826,81186,77932,294,22827,14240,266,409,77323,51625,554,1765,3930,1891,370,66522,11,1744,326,54386,917,6853,514,28439,32118,6323,337,2428,13,34447,45575,11,17317,11427,2439,3846,6502,78422,532,409,68226,27389,43406,409,4538,69003,8047,11,665,4046,55923,84554,11,51794,479,1880,100198,27750,7591,969,25108,70,91555,11,36346,14707,272,17771,1120,1133,3846,1744,4864,259,6960,409,20028,3930,1323,7211,265,13,445,27688,8047,11,272,17771,1744,87158,326,54386,5945,544,265,409,7591,969,25108,40280,11,272,17771,62891,1765,514,14707,71151,9621,8065,53052,409,29449,6225,11,81186,8065,53052,409,98385,22337,20243,2482,1744,326,54386,917,6853,3625,32118,6323,337,3695,13,1219,2727,4864,308,34155,6502,18757,39929,2680,978,951,44453,4918,665,29340,361,409,29449,52827,514,14502,283,301,11,4864,42775,273,1765,3625,44453,4918,409,48577,29005,70,14014,18434,519,8065,80288,13,435,2259,1001,11,272,17771,6502,4502,326,41901,593,39043,3930,7970,48734,13,3206,25276,11,272,17771,409,93455,3625,48577,1880,514,4632,1880,274,55624,442,306,32118,6323,337,2428,11,1208,86806,7930,841,326,6,546,6502,13,1708,1105,11,8065,65385,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,7631,978,8065,281,12339,2360,74553,409,296,6,391,90332,653,8622,52760,6141,3357,324,13,19421,41199,11,4864,326,49963,1082,5019,259,1992,409,60946,265,1880,57705,14081,1082,1880,9622,4168,261,11,54401,409,3625,71925,1992,7010,653,83597,51307,2428,13,27058,513,20028,11,4864,757,2385,11,1765,326,31769,65272,951,32118,6323,337,3695,665,514,29340,13,34447,11,272,17771,44767,1765,951,46681,54368,288,4747,519,3625,924,75004,13,4366,51173,11,28130,4197,13109,64441,6033,43153,6183,21237,38450,17724,13,350,5612,27750,44827,2922,6496,15132,21901,82,294,81991,11540,3916,13,356,17771,3869,514,71925,1992,6316,10484,13109,77554,14081,481,409,46681,51307,8467,13,46706,1647,4865,11,3846,15132,84364,409,220,18,11990,220,4728,220,931,7482,13,41621,9189,7591,65,3675,1744,220,1041,326,26248,579,951,63922,1354,11,220,18,65838,409,270,4558,325,841,15132,6502,21965,5019,16968,18027,261,13,435,2259,1001,11,3869,1208,1913,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,1880,77433,3869,1208,49586,409,40744,27750,46681,11,4864,3567,14687,68226,10045,261,6316,34024,409,22337,20243,2482,274,2379,1572,57705,978,6091,519,514,28439,32118,6323,337,2428,13,7695,8657,9008,45575,294,6,269,978,5893,53070,6316,4382,5636,409,29340,8065,281,12339,409,12155,9517,37907,5019,1760,978,1414,829,77323,33670,1744,514,1891,370,66522,308,17771,1798,5164,1880,1744,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,841,779,1188,4502,9517,3078,21041,13,1952,5019,969,44351,11,33254,19610,12155,9517,37907,11,1880,2018,8977,3869,2215,35573,951,78418,12249,32592,514,35735,258,13,1708,1105,11,3869,9189,70556,11,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,66343,2410,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,31692,264,3717,449,279,10877,555,10371,422,5606,13919,304,477,706,11846,304,279,7434,315,330,716,83353,301,1,320,8370,374,539,4613,304,279,36815,570,1115,5603,8779,311,1977,39474,323,3727,279,10877,810,88651,311,279,2800,315,279,1984,13,578,19114,1243,34692,1139,25394,872,4443
