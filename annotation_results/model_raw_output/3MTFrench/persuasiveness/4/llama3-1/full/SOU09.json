{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T20:49:34.432757751Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5 (SCALE: 1-5, where 1 = not at all and 5 = very much).\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by presenting their argument in a clear and concise manner. They start by establishing a connection with the audience, explaining that they want to \"jouer avec cette électricité\" (play with this electricity) to find innovative therapies for patients. This opening sets a positive tone and shows that the speaker is enthusiastic about their work.\n\nThe speaker then explains their research methodology and findings in detail, providing specific examples and data points to support their claims. They also acknowledge potential limitations and challenges, showing an awareness of potential criticisms and addressing them proactively. This transparency helps build credibility with the audience.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker uses analogies (e.g., comparing the stimulation process to driving on a route) to make complex concepts more relatable and accessible. This approach makes their message more engaging and easier to understand for a broader audience.\n\nOverall, while there may be minor areas where the speaker could improve their persuasiveness (e.g., providing more concrete examples of the benefits or applications of their research), I believe they effectively craft a convincing message that is well-supported by their data and enthusiasm.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,64105,64,33614,1744,15265,272,5976,2933,34501,818,1370,514,293,57567,409,326,31769,47262,13109,13,29124,588,484,978,11,15265,272,5976,2933,25692,453,318,1992,7010,220,16,11,914,305,13,356,8458,92215,23761,6316,9517,52274,2354,5019,3625,91329,16549,288,11,10071,5019,1647,29005,2727,409,60120,18247,56447,333,8467,11,326,6,1735,333,1826,16968,47838,13,97148,261,9952,20662,4046,47262,13109,5019,46524,951,7317,391,552,9721,15844,13,4366,51173,11,5019,9517,998,72540,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,5019,18027,261,76076,951,28405,5247,19266,265,4749,2249,13,507,2005,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,41959,19266,265,42743,2848,17675,13,62463,12936,7607,6824,68,665,326,6,6517,519,367,409,26633,98151,299,5919,3869,326,55624,57663,3930,272,5976,2933,7930,11412,96586,4667,261,653,8045,10733,7930,11412,96586,12936,8646,4046,47262,1133,665,16513,514,272,5976,2933,13,1252,28800,22299,653,1798,266,11,220,508,13615,13,5019,514,1080,12844,13,62408,15105,1826,10045,8047,81186,46206,11939,93381,46429,409,1208,8811,329,648,409,62145,5019,514,1080,12844,11,514,89714,35030,52777,324,11,2605,61652,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,13,507,2005,11,39723,3625,98151,28787,2142,11,272,17771,294,31109,294,6,13885,1572,409,8198,17422,11,10071,3846,308,17771,6502,951,11148,1220,409,10025,593,13,5186,12416,45889,65838,11,20662,41959,2605,61652,44767,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,22299,951,26483,2396,409,1208,15572,68,6033,409,326,31769,447,31059,265,13,5034,41959,665,16513,11,46206,3625,6978,1370,649,325,773,818,11,308,17771,6502,10737,978,3869,28130,99568,3675,13,362,64160,409,7809,57288,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,9189,29465,5741,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,9189,29465,5741,11,665,16513,11,3869,274,6,306,11588,68,934,35329,17317,2322,2221,556,1765,653,2700,62868,1413,409,6149,13,2998,4725,11,9189,12584,89,917,8023,15265,348,87960,8065,955,409,6149,1880,3869,1208,6149,665,1194,978,13,4366,86633,11,1880,3869,1208,6149,665,1194,978,11,5019,51913,2058,27750,46838,351,43711,1392,11,3900,2267,664,14687,46524,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,272,1260,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,7695,2267,664,14687,1744,1208,41959,45441,51625,1082,1880,934,80720,45441,4642,7010,653,12025,547,13,14465,91507,312,59976,265,11083,1560,652,1220,13,7695,47090,46524,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,272,1260,13,622,34155,665,49564,978,326,6,9035,13109,98151,34395,46206,220,4370,6978,7010,6316,88100,14707,51625,1082,11,7930,1826,514,912,88,2933,65827,17243,2428,13,14465,757,36731,92759,978,3869,51854,1719,75104,409,20662,4197,13109,13,5034,1448,978,4474,1826,1208,18757,24918,5019,95917,359,409,27750,6978,13,14465,91507,9189,390,1658,977,3869,51854,32116,13,2876,64656,11,1208,1448,978,4474,1880,1208,18757,24918,97958,25945,7482,46206,27750,6978,13,622,34155,824,5979,978,5553,42844,56321,8261,1880,503,34155,100162,1744,326,6,9035,13109,43989,908,978,8065,12104,99757,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,13,19421,272,17771,6316,22710,265,7930,11412,29557,10367,409,75831,6316,41959,97252,35965,8047,7010,653,18111,324,463,1557,5019,3625,6978,7930,82133,29557,10367,3846,7930,82133,68226,513,5534,7420,3869,25400,13,65381,6316,348,87960,10737,8047,1765,514,7364,3930,7970,383,324,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,320,66068,25,220,16,12,20,11,1405,220,16,284,539,520,682,323,220,20,284,1633,1790,570,198,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,32644,872,5811,304,264,2867,323,64694,11827,13,2435,1212,555,31692,264,3717,449,279,10877,11,26073,430,814,1390,311,330,73,283,261,9952,20662,4046,47262,13109,1,320,1387,449,420,18200,8,311,1505,18699,52312,369,6978,13,1115,8736,7437,264,6928,16630,323,5039,430,279,19114,374,42702,922,872,990,627,198,791,19114,1243,15100,872,3495,38152,323,14955,304,7872,11,8405,3230,10507,323,828,3585,311,1862,872,8349,13,2435,1101,25670,4754,9669,323,11774,11,9204,459,17985,315,4754,63836,323,28118,1124,463,64119,13,1115,28330,8779,1977,38769,449,279,10877,627,198,50674,11,279,19114,5829,24291,552,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,279,41959,1920,311,10043,389,264,6149,8,311,1304,6485,19476,810,1375,15436,323,15987,13,1115,5603,3727,872,1984,810,23387,323,8831,311,3619,369,264,27927,10877,627,198,28589,11,1418,1070,1253,387,9099,5789,1405,279,19114,1436,7417,872,24613,300,13071,320,68,13,70,2637,8405,810,14509,10507,315,279,7720,477,8522,315,872,3495,
