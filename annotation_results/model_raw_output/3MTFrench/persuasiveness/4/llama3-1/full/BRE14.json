Establishing a connection with the audience: The speaker starts by explaining their thesis and sharing personal experiences, which helps to build rapport with the listener.\n2. Providing context and background information: The speaker provides a clear explanation of their research topic and the historical context in which it is set, making it easier for the audience to understand the significance of the issue.\n3. Using storytelling techniques: The speaker uses anecdotes and metaphors to illustrate their points, making the message more engaging and memorable.\n4. Highlighting the relevance of the topic: The speaker emphasizes the continued relevance of the issues they are discussing, highlighting the need for ongoing reflection and action.\n\nThe only area where the speech could be improved is in providing more explicit connections between the historical context and the contemporary implications. While the speaker does a good job of explaining their research topic, the links to modern-day issues are not explicitly stated. However, this is a minor criticism, and overall, I would rate the persuasive power of the speech as 4/5.\n\n**Score:
