{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T21:36:39.015070723Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would give a score of 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using storytelling techniques, vivid imagery, and relatable examples. They establish a connection with the audience by acknowledging that everyone has experienced similar situations and using phrases like \"vous avez certainement déjà adopté une partie de ces comportements dans vos villes.\" The speaker's tone is conversational and engaging, making the audience feel like they are having a conversation with the speaker rather than listening to a formal lecture.\n\nThe reasoning presented in the speech is rigorous, as the speaker provides evidence-based examples from their research and invites the audience to share their own experiences. The speaker also acknowledges that there may be different perspectives on the topic, which adds to the credibility of the message.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score (5 out of 5) is that some parts of the speech seem a bit repetitive or wandering, which might detract from the overall impact of the message. However, overall, the speaker does an excellent job of presenting their ideas and engaging with the audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,4635,2852,53070,1765,1543,1370,379,86451,13,41621,379,62299,25692,85815,46939,682,978,6033,3930,40970,9189,312,5259,2852,53070,514,82660,3527,13,27058,66056,7930,841,74282,79738,6502,11,272,17771,4382,13,1952,1826,4685,306,3930,15528,11,87885,7828,343,11,951,1380,988,11,665,7245,483,39973,1880,7598,11,16968,514,38900,513,7591,89,370,648,5019,20028,1437,28143,23761,22299,3869,1208,86451,13,19421,14707,1647,70927,409,350,26577,6178,1354,11,47090,653,16968,3930,656,18400,3869,1343,98078,48099,35597,5636,1765,79,1466,519,7930,35456,2035,7010,12155,26886,645,13,46706,76076,16948,2492,586,82,71151,8065,39002,409,326,93847,11,3625,6681,329,1354,14848,8541,685,3869,513,52962,261,22299,3869,1208,86451,11,45575,1744,514,39381,308,17771,3869,4972,72,6502,3869,3026,1435,5019,13,24703,15132,27750,16948,2492,2922,6496,1744,17317,57038,76190,978,3625,628,1154,78810,33903,37391,276,14014,13,445,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,409,60946,265,3846,7930,7010,1208,29079,13109,409,27750,10457,2249,11,10383,28130,86740,1370,3625,6681,329,1354,1880,3625,17258,784,3869,945,404,409,1208,80444,13,34447,33670,16968,11,934,17771,54312,934,22827,52962,1133,409,86451,757,13510,89,45325,30,19421,14707,7010,653,2317,68,39723,1208,17536,1826,409,5636,665,5636,25945,3288,68,1880,39723,3738,288,48577,308,6,546,6502,326,6,94411,294,6,14283,665,9467,3095,11,76076,10457,2249,513,2503,306,6316,57128,409,22848,978,13,19421,29557,10367,28463,259,6,329,1354,409,75249,6183,2058,11,409,1375,9011,9211,28130,34922,1880,28130,15907,993,4462,2492,3869,326,93847,8065,13612,321,11,8065,2092,1880,8065,10594,11,1880,1370,86633,27584,409,7591,7642,3625,4958,3978,2392,1880,3625,7643,484,2469,409,293,467,11,16968,22299,3869,1208,86451,13,62463,33726,43215,75460,10253,33726,78810,33903,14464,61244,96308,57705,978,6091,14014,1370,1208,33956,13109,11,514,6155,57332,1880,1208,312,2002,361,864,7521,306,2035,653,459,409,1370,51173,7010,51854,628,1154,78810,33903,37391,276,14014,8065,39002,409,326,6,1334,1880,409,1208,82291,13,62463,628,1154,80163,14014,4790,12059,294,31109,961,653,39474,51199,3869,326,77025,1330,586,11,39723,514,6681,32084,3567,1188,1180,12844,1880,2536,29121,1133,9618,11067,951,603,1154,409,829,39973,11,10071,28463,76776,653,39474,304,15433,822,8065,34922,11,39587,4864,841,80444,409,24811,18479,80664,306,3625,503,1468,318,5512,514,7591,3415,458,479,13,41621,47592,3738,1133,46939,11142,978,6316,48901,409,27750,52962,3808,7010,26317,26886,645,13,15663,1771,409,9189,15132,25692,85815,682,5512,3869,326,6,39749,23034,11,10071,3846,15132,4685,5512,8065,39002,409,326,93847,9952,4958,3978,2392,11,1589,25253,2092,12267,1880,7643,484,354,409,293,467,11,1880,76076,665,67683,969,1188,25692,85815,294,41901,2749,15878,297,805,3869,326,31769,4345,68,16081,13,19421,14707,93569,89,1474,6870,9189,13510,1744,27750,33726,841,3355,89810,6502,29121,1133,409,9189,11,1880,2536,9189,308,6,90276,6502,94773,48647,13,445,77025,1330,20272,1370,86633,409,9189,3846,934,35329,76605,13,2998,9189,9466,519,11,9189,296,6,52659,917,6091,1181,66,6388,294,22827,51854,79165,1765,27750,842,299,1220,42844,1647,77807,37093,13,41621,296,6,52659,917,6091,1370,51173,1744,951,33013,98942,409,89869,9952,326,41901,2842,40280,78810,467,11,259,6853,1744,1208,58482,85,7709,11,1208,30179,768,294,31109,281,6960,6033,1208,44178,16271,409,53052,11,9189,91878,3869,9189,1375,9011,9211,665,39973,13,622,34155,13550,285,1744,326,93847,9189,71751,6316,37392,951,781,625,3808,28463,14707,7891,8467,1744,2145,4088,11,7930,9189,91878,3869,9189,3127,52424,13,34447,503,34155,28463,24560,1448,680,978,1370,3625,9045,3116,45168,1370,76076,294,6,40997,9189,5019,27389,62219,28130,34922,294,6,39883,665,1437,28143,519,33670,294,6,14283,3869,326,49152,462,481,13,2998,16968,4865,11,11083,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,42676,9189,62299,1765,27750,16948,2492,2922,6496,11,274,1815,89,1744,4864,9189,23846,13,3206,9511,67763,3869,41091,11,1880,14707,11,272,17771,9189,13,14465,9406,1088,514,40970,409,9189,54409,7986,13,14465,9189,342,37093,13,19421,1370,86633,11,4864,3355,729,294,59858,3846,934,35329,259,26248,9952,9189,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,9189,20272,75802,11,49733,5636,272,6,74,352,12844,48647,409,9189,1375,9011,9211,1880,409,45347,665,45889,4520,6033,45889,2961,5615,880,812,409,26317,45188,409,42775,33670,8232,273,354,409,7363,818,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,38
