{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T20:06:29.378490039Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of Fabrice's speech as a 4 out of 5 (very much).\n\nFabrice effectively crafts a convincing message by sharing his personal experience and emotions, which makes his argument more relatable and authentic. He also provides specific examples and anecdotes that illustrate his points, making his reasoning more concrete and easier to follow.\n\nAdditionally, Fabrice shows an understanding of the complexity of accidents at work and acknowledges the various factors involved, including individual, organizational, and environmental factors. This demonstrates a nuanced approach to problem-solving and a willingness to consider multiple perspectives.\n\nHowever, I would deduct one point because Fabrice's speech is not entirely free from distractions, such as the sudden shift in topic towards the end (e.g., \"Bon, c'est pas tout, monsieur Paul, qu'est-ce qu'on fait en va faire le go√ªter? Allez, revoir.\"). This minor detour slightly diminishes the overall persuasiveness of his message.\n\nOverall, Fabrice's speech is engaging, relatable, and well-reasoned, making it a strong attempt at persuasion.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,33150,4545,294,6,40997,59976,265,951,88817,8696,1765,326,69537,1748,3930,42775,7010,514,31237,12844,11,274,62595,635,1880,1323,15433,292,75107,11,3900,757,3429,1056,1339,64284,294,6,14283,958,299,1414,653,951,7546,12249,92759,5512,13,19797,23994,11,4160,321,6496,220,508,8261,1744,9189,42775,41881,3869,653,47276,409,312,2221,635,409,2394,278,6729,582,11,1826,54312,1744,9189,45366,17317,89504,409,326,69537,1748,3930,42775,949,19421,14707,9952,80410,11,665,20272,7010,3625,10071,2439,409,312,2221,635,1880,951,33788,11,272,17771,76776,951,523,2142,1880,514,8811,347,354,13,1708,1105,5019,3625,523,2142,11,389,264,5906,951,5347,33903,653,46110,7591,4714,519,258,1880,5019,514,8811,347,354,11,389,264,24560,1376,978,13,33150,13033,68,1880,48378,11,1880,44829,389,264,5906,951,18803,437,628,2642,51058,961,412,1880,951,7363,4918,11,10071,4864,9189,20605,265,13,50601,62005,7043,11,9189,45366,9189,1089,52750,7010,514,7363,1291,11,1880,4160,321,6496,11,22299,39043,50601,62005,7043,11,4864,326,58591,48099,409,3930,13318,3869,1208,71632,409,293,467,44829,409,1208,71632,409,293,467,8065,9517,3836,13603,1880,9952,6316,86806,1925,13,34447,16968,39043,11,39043,264,24560,25945,31914,580,11,10071,41199,45889,65838,11,3625,33788,379,6,546,2109,472,519,1208,71372,325,13,19421,41091,4864,73953,934,35329,513,39904,79071,14896,11,4864,9189,15473,46452,13,7671,519,409,88026,11,4864,8175,265,7010,6316,87938,11,4864,100164,653,436,5362,951,75119,11,308,17771,6316,5954,77,37093,409,503,6,3064,2070,6316,523,13559,11,4864,436,4575,299,1557,326,6,269,5362,1880,389,2579,3380,20995,514,7364,409,55455,13,1708,1105,1744,4864,63762,934,35329,47090,1744,503,53149,301,713,665,85807,11,272,17771,29449,8479,15105,13,34447,514,27138,934,35329,86100,11,514,27138,4635,96559,3327,2428,293,1116,11,503,34155,52579,1208,523,13559,1880,4864,757,36731,20272,8811,13,34447,294,3695,11,272,17771,9189,514,52571,324,11,9189,45366,6502,757,13510,653,28800,3846,1744,9189,665,73953,89,11,10071,14707,97717,11,19797,23994,13,2998,20272,11,4864,73953,4839,1133,22299,9189,11,4864,73953,1744,326,58591,10610,3531,951,1772,288,409,42775,841,8657,275,5636,13,19421,4864,73953,28463,22299,9189,1744,514,65827,3675,951,4631,4558,70,1157,1826,653,951,2144,38647,1206,5512,409,27389,7611,13,34447,665,20272,11,326,69537,1748,3930,42775,1826,653,11677,1826,653,51913,10610,1133,4225,258,372,48099,6485,68,13,14465,9189,3327,2428,13,12623,389,274,41901,3057,1557,1880,5636,389,71451,951,2144,38647,23496,65832,11,15265,14240,266,409,77323,11,653,60014,100063,13033,68,13,1952,274,41901,1826,781,625,978,11,389,71451,951,2144,38647,22139,3916,1208,59471,409,326,31769,74199,50753,1370,51173,13,19421,4502,389,11412,653,28800,5636,78060,11,389,71451,951,2144,38647,50026,40280,12249,514,53052,409,326,31769,45317,648,11,514,9637,2249,409,523,9769,53410,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,58673,484,978,1765,20719,2428,13,19421,503,34155,59148,1653,11,13550,285,665,3625,4046,74199,15760,1392,11,1370,326,6,1617,52009,11,1370,326,6,9035,13109,1880,1370,326,83508,3768,8082,11,389,17258,85,1339,9129,8977,6316,74190,8511,409,57951,3869,28800,84364,8065,3937,36963,665,7589,380,3545,13109,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,4864,86345,6316,10474,3154,261,55455,7930,42182,757,29557,10367,294,6,47977,1291,3869,95917,359,409,27750,1912,288,11,3625,2144,38647,1206,5512,294,69537,1748,3930,42775,13,1252,4502,389,5019,969,39929,6316,27389,7611,10737,8047,3869,46777,4046,74199,50753,11,1880,15265,42775,35737,5636,97717,13,61651,3399,3846,87264,348,613,1133,14707,13,19421,4502,9189,26483,19610,79071,14896,11,1880,1744,9189,47592,35597,56321,4520,3869,757,1615,582,38149,11,19443,10333,35073,46131,66021,1744,503,34155,296,6,4202,2852,14707,296,26248,28463,69003,978,3869,1208,312,2221,635,665,7970,409,77323,13,13789,11,272,17771,6502,16968,11,1647,82,62005,7043,11,934,17771,54312,934,54386,20272,665,11412,20028,514,733,30872,466,30,1708,41881,11,312,35573,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,19797,23994,596,8982,439,264,220,19,704,315,220,20,320,1225,1790,570,198,198,53267,23994,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,11821,813,4443,3217,323,21958,11,902,3727,813,5811,810,1375,15436,323,13513,13,1283,1101,5825,3230,10507,323,94066,430,41468,813,3585,11,3339,813,33811,810,14509,323,8831,311,1833,627,198,50674,11,19797,23994,5039,459,8830,315,279,23965
