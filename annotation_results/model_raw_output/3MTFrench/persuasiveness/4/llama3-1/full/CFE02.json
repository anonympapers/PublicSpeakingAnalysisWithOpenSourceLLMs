The use of rhetorical devices such as metaphors (\"jeux de mots\") and vivid descriptions (\"des d√©chets phara-minuse\") adds flavor to the speech and makes it more engaging. The speaker also presents a clear argument, highlighting the benefits of recycling lignin and creating a new composite material.\n\nThe reasoning is not entirely rigorous, as the speaker jumps between different ideas and concepts without providing clear evidence or logical connections. However, the overall message is still convincing and persuasive, making me give it a score of 4 out of 5.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,26248,547,3625,7591,331,1441,13,41621,26483,19610,829,33288,665,27584,27138,13,57702,1208,10484,13109,1343,5169,13703,817,409,7591,331,1441,934,54386,264,934,31109,296,1130,1765,20662,3197,66522,11,64972,4499,5512,264,3212,1744,3625,7591,1985,5512,13,1708,1105,11,4502,389,864,77,1339,779,258,409,12155,7591,331,1441,11,259,21198,5019,2558,556,3930,26365,1291,11,389,69152,3930,66304,11,272,17771,14707,4635,84,13,46706,8941,11741,1339,11,1208,2849,1130,305,3538,13,34447,11,389,78422,12339,28463,8065,21765,220,1041,11990,409,52021,1370,459,11,409,1647,7591,331,1441,27389,69,68862,13,5034,72700,483,11,26633,90272,75164,3682,60224,3930,66304,13,1952,841,829,275,6502,75249,20028,45575,389,326,26248,1437,30872,273,5019,2558,556,409,326,31769,64374,13,435,2957,1826,54312,409,21273,258,30,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,46838,404,569,64656,33254,424,1208,72700,483,951,1344,8836,288,13,14465,52571,42463,1744,72353,668,264,14448,69068,3846,7591,331,1441,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,4864,56445,46939,1370,8464,6316,5017,978,3869,1208,72700,483,13,14465,25400,21559,951,463,339,978,1572,5019,1208,9517,533,1553,8065,53052,409,27750,19670,288,294,6,61263,70,48099,13,46408,312,59976,3930,97418,951,1376,288,11,97507,11,39043,296,26248,16603,3625,1400,31539,49806,288,13,9240,68,829,16458,554,8841,1640,2428,13,432,5512,495,266,409,829,19266,36235,369,51084,9952,1208,2849,1130,305,3538,13,27058,1208,65827,268,404,11,4864,25400,30179,6960,653,47838,7591,331,1441,13,386,5014,12,466,417,436,2642,645,409,7643,38672,82,11,514,72006,12,39754,74801,438,13,34447,4502,9189,23933,10333,3846,7591,331,1441,11,934,54386,25692,46131,490,32453,7010,1208,11277,409,1208,4671,8511,13,27058,28130,10607,11,4864,9517,1072,285,757,1765,665,281,3023,265,13,32429,4502,9964,274,6,300,993,13559,22299,39043,46206,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,11,272,3433,978,41091,11,7591,331,1441,5636,7591,331,1441,11,39043,2489,13,51097,26633,463,339,978,11932,75460,15132,19227,1001,37608,36527,7930,514,1913,79738,1370,71751,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,13,39783,80444,409,88247,2428,5790,10676,978,11,6160,536,78130,11,63828,1414,665,36292,1880,90551,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,8162,1474,978,376,2428,11,4864,326,6,49133,7010,3625,4647,485,417,951,9986,645,13,14465,514,490,33462,554,11,4864,326,6,44803,325,11,4864,75765,829,31807,4011,32118,4919,2428,13,1252,2816,25692,23761,1744,2486,467,11,5019,3869,312,10398,15170,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,7010,3625,757,392,645,409,12155,31547,1572,11,1208,348,87960,3869,1208,81645,11,1208,1080,593,409,12155,43116,17144,11,1370,1647,42775,1880,665,14448,285,519,1880,4046,67,5615,9211,22299,1208,4671,483,11,503,6,391,45808,6316,6425,27220,8065,1323,16491,951,88247,8467,2425,355,3930,281,10515,5898,13,19421,97507,11,9189,23933,10333,11,9952,653,1437,258,409,68567,44618,28463,11,389,25692,20028,1860,11967,514,38900,13,4418,66,97507,11,46152,15132,19227,1001,37608,36527,7930,33537,306,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,8162,1474,978,376,2428,11,503,6,49133,3625,78352,409,326,6,867,75,1082,11,389,523,2428,13,2009,9517,79,10515,306,11,389,2109,1339,326,6,90446,13,19421,4160,321,6496,11,39587,503,34155,5906,409,17571,951,297,398,325,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,279,8982,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,264,1375,15436,8712,320,2827,16404,8,323,3339,4443,13537,311,279,10877,13,578,1005,315,87068,7766,1778,439,31768,1105,3573,3841,2249,409,78199,909,323,43120,28887,3573,5919,7591,331,1441,1343,5169,13703,817,909,11621,17615,311,279,8982,323,3727,433,810,23387,13,578,19114,1101,18911,264,2867,5811,11,39686,279,7720,315,34978,72700,258,323,6968,264,502,28814,3769,627,198,791,33811,374,539,11622,47999,11,439,279,19114,35308,1990,2204,6848,323,19476,2085,8405,2867,6029,477,20406,13537,13,4452,11,279,8244,1984,374,2103,40661,323,66343,11,3339,757,3041,433,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,13,128009],"total_duration":37827262019,"load_duration":148751,"prompt_eval_count":804,"prompt_eval_duration":3536606000,"eval_count":156,"eval_duration":34290060000}
