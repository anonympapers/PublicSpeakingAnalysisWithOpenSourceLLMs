The reasoning is also rigorous, as the speaker presents a clear problem (pollution from central heating), proposes a solution (developing a more efficient temperature model), and provides evidence for its effectiveness (measuring temperatures in real-world scenarios).\n\nThe only area where the speech could be improved is in providing more concrete details about the specific solutions proposed or the exact benefits of the new temperature model. However, overall, the speaker's approach is engaging and well-structured, making it a persuasive performance.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,9189,30714,409,96586,9952,41091,5019,20028,653,46110,7364,13,38891,89,45325,11,9189,12584,89,3869,1208,68468,483,20188,1604,13,4366,51173,11,73103,39723,82133,3625,60404,9952,3625,14480,5019,917,9484,265,653,29005,70,978,11,272,17771,326,39982,1553,11,27549,1826,74817,8047,13,41621,10390,655,514,44630,7010,326,93847,11,27549,1826,51651,11,934,80720,51651,324,11,9189,628,647,10333,13,2998,3460,519,11,9189,39904,89,77558,1208,2960,46140,30945,2428,8065,1488,11,653,25500,45640,409,282,372,8047,3460,409,1208,88768,8047,13,41621,62299,665,1400,12339,11,1841,27549,308,17771,44093,6502,81682,8047,13,41621,7631,10333,934,80720,1826,514,55520,9465,1208,2960,46140,30945,2428,1880,1208,68468,483,11,1880,14707,11,4502,1208,2960,46140,30945,2428,34501,818,11,39043,5019,13826,2084,1208,68468,483,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,3489,438,389,8175,265,514,3460,3930,42775,11,389,1437,29097,26725,665,27584,27138,11,1208,3678,1800,27197,13,27058,75871,265,3869,1208,62163,11,951,2960,46140,30945,8467,7230,84,15844,15132,682,372,14014,13,34447,28463,11,514,38847,951,1615,20372,811,14240,278,12328,14014,5019,3625,67965,2053,11,5019,3625,1672,2058,3869,48416,8977,28130,1615,20372,367,13,622,34155,39587,7591,21200,978,409,48021,665,2035,653,72601,7930,29557,409,841,6502,13826,2084,3625,68468,1572,10878,519,20662,84411,536,11,10071,8065,32150,556,409,2848,2058,951,84411,2601,308,6,2985,1439,6033,326,6,8188,1880,6033,1208,1615,20372,367,3369,4558,22221,13,24703,46110,7364,11,7010,1208,68468,483,11,9189,1046,299,1082,89,1208,281,10515,635,11,274,6,57558,14707,11,4864,9189,22114,7010,7643,36105,13,622,34155,6233,648,409,20028,653,342,69628,2933,8065,72476,266,11,272,17771,1647,68468,483,62799,13,34447,503,34155,6502,8811,409,1421,47003,11,4864,63762,6502,21965,1208,79071,14896,13,14465,35881,579,409,326,31769,74458,13,14465,45324,22626,84440,11,4864,35456,82,1208,3117,483,11,514,924,846,11,4864,296,19010,853,11,4864,66517,21901,265,514,72476,266,11,4864,757,282,788,11,42138,51854,4043,2852,11,5310,42827,11,503,34155,100162,514,342,69628,2933,86966,13,27058,757,13510,11,951,80080,11,1647,42775,5019,1208,259,24201,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,1208,3352,285,62243,13,14465,52571,1208,51651,1421,6672,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,3846,308,17771,6502,653,342,69628,2933,11,10071,1208,2798,14081,1598,409,326,93847,409,1208,68468,483,13,5034,1421,6672,1826,514,83597,1744,4864,52571,3869,7591,23827,261,1880,7930,757,29557,2221,409,5935,261,1208,2798,14081,1598,409,326,93847,13,27058,45602,11,4864,9517,981,2439,3869,951,82134,81336,15433,4167,11,2798,14081,1598,409,326,6,1334,11,2798,14081,1598,3930,10594,11,2854,3748,978,409,326,6,1334,11,6033,35597,514,13026,409,3399,59307,13,2998,1370,543,51453,11,503,34155,86595,978,951,11083,1439,1765,6316,68468,483,665,40761,13,14465,94297,45575,93455,1208,2798,14081,1598,11,11083,7889,1880,1208,1391,14081,1598,5935,261,13,24703,7930,757,29557,409,7591,23827,261,514,49348,83597,13,3489,438,4864,326,34155,11,4864,94297,45575,46524,514,4545,887,63497,5019,13826,2084,3625,22253,1354,13,19421,4864,5213,6364,1370,514,4545,409,3846,48416,28674,44351,11,326,6,58400,11,514,16081,294,6,69331,7709,1880,1370,1208,27584,13402,11,326,6,58400,513,1765,326,41901,2842,40280,13,80905,514,38900,1826,2262,13,19421,42676,4864,9517,981,285,11,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,48929,12823,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,279,2778,369,279,4832,11363,311,9455,279,1314,9499,1646,8,323,3339,459,14604,3717,449,279,10877,320,68,13,70,2637,45391,279,12939,315,18189,12434,5536,570,578,33811,374,1101,47999,11,439,279,19114,18911,264,2867,3575,320,31241,1516,505,8792,24494,705,55725,264,6425,320,16219,287,264,810,11297,9499,1646,705,323,5825,6029,369,1202,27375,320,2727,69774,20472,304,1972,31184,26350,570,198,198,791,1193,3158,1405,279,8982,1436,387,13241,374,304,8405,810,14509,3649,922,279,3230,10105,11223,477,279,4839,7720,315,279,502,9499,1646,13,4452,11,8244,11,279,19114,596,5603,374,23387,323,1664,12,52243,11,3339,433,264,66343,5178,13,128009],"total_duration":41146900879,"load_duration":233870,"prompt_eval_count":806,"prompt_eval_duration":3527891000,"eval_count":171,"eval_duration":37618204000}
