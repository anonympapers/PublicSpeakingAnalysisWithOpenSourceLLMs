{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T20:01:36.764488404Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would give a score of 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by providing a clear explanation of the importance of civil status records and how they can affect individuals who move across borders. The speaker's reasoning is rigorous as they provide specific examples and references to international conventions, regulations, and court decisions that support their argument. The use of personal anecdotes adds a human touch and helps to illustrate the consequences of not having a standardized system for recording civil status.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that some parts of the speech feel slightly repetitive or overly detailed in certain areas, which might make it less engaging for listeners who are not already familiar with the topic. However, overall, the speaker's passion and expertise shine through, making their message highly persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,34447,1744,20272,12,6853,409,19189,265,3869,28800,95199,268,949,14465,36731,16422,17194,1880,503,34155,9964,22011,3625,52314,8431,82,13,27058,9189,11,3900,841,274,6,74972,3738,1133,1744,409,4382,16287,13109,23541,13,2998,59157,13109,11,3625,52314,8431,82,11,272,17771,14707,5636,1744,39043,13,356,17771,326,6,49575,951,1180,288,7930,3613,68495,15265,17536,409,15265,4415,24918,55398,81991,15265,10237,13,3298,68,409,4415,24918,11,409,89360,11,409,35881,12416,11,272,17771,15265,48454,294,6,1748,13109,16422,307,2428,1765,1208,88265,15132,1672,38096,82,26725,3625,97222,1744,9189,47592,1645,9383,16968,8065,1317,409,15265,17536,13,33150,19910,409,326,6,33758,95199,26193,11,1880,5636,46680,969,1001,7010,514,38900,1218,1291,11,272,17771,64079,5019,841,6502,23761,11,841,15132,6502,42345,978,8637,81235,312,5259,355,294,22827,14240,266,653,47838,13,12095,9189,35881,579,89,409,30517,261,3625,4156,59307,11,5019,9189,44152,27584,27138,5019,4046,81,3212,7010,653,47838,21935,11,653,14240,266,3930,62321,409,829,5945,424,467,295,978,11,5019,653,2098,355,978,409,16456,3458,66014,653,1180,68,11,66021,934,35329,841,8024,6502,3869,829,83187,82291,13,2998,1794,2727,11,7010,3846,21935,11,26317,97222,78871,41518,355,13,41621,308,58736,1601,1339,5636,16422,307,81235,13,452,6,24677,402,52009,6824,68,3869,14240,664,1291,27750,96642,15082,1880,9071,10333,409,88817,9211,6316,3738,68,38793,951,83229,86709,409,64079,13,27058,51913,2058,11,653,13088,373,11826,11,12985,978,665,9822,11,1208,282,9011,1557,817,11,11083,91806,1439,11,409,409,43406,13088,373,3930,37194,11,41079,51084,665,1708,3516,24812,13,2998,37622,1744,16422,17194,11,503,34155,951,704,8839,3869,7643,46096,13,11876,45593,2655,367,3916,11,3625,83229,70,91555,95199,729,11,3625,18027,5512,11,3625,35881,6948,409,1208,6377,409,12437,409,326,6,33758,95199,26193,11,3625,94527,7546,288,409,1208,6377,95199,26193,11,951,97222,409,326,6,87713,13,8242,3625,447,37907,11,4864,296,53149,84,648,5019,27389,4120,3625,97222,3930,6681,2303,268,95199,268,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,10045,261,2192,27584,6316,6425,13509,1604,13,27058,62998,841,6502,75831,653,1180,68,5016,1765,514,43014,87264,1672,38096,11,665,14902,9952,3625,29124,83,1900,11,951,97222,21901,2908,12249,11,7930,841,92215,56316,23761,1323,285,665,5353,13,1252,1180,68,294,57286,266,8431,95199,268,13,34447,55455,308,17771,28068,978,11,1880,22299,653,4046,447,31059,265,17194,11,503,49152,685,665,88817,11943,514,77411,4046,447,31059,265,9465,294,22827,81337,11,3625,1218,32029,951,29124,83,1900,1880,409,326,49455,265,11,1208,22848,978,951,23496,355,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,8405,264,2867,16540,315,279,12939,315,8431,2704,7576,323,1268,814,649,7958,7931,889,3351,4028,24743,13,578,19114,596,33811,374,47999,439,814,3493,3230,10507,323,15407,311,6625,45593,11,14640,11,323,5590,11429,430,1862,872,5811,13,578,1005,315,4443,94066,11621,264,3823,5916,323,8779,311,41468,279,16296,315,539,3515,264,51114,1887,369,14975,8431,2704,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,4832,5573,374,430,1063,5596,315,279,8982,2733,10284,59177,477,39532,11944,304,3738,5789,11,902,2643,1304,433,2753,23387,369,24475,889,527,539,2736,11537,449,279,8712,13,4452,11,8244,11,279,19114,596,11939,323,19248,33505,1555,11,3339,872,1984,7701,66343,13,128009],"total_duration":6241190349,"load_duration":230158,"prompt_eval_count":657,"prompt_eval_duration":1297663000,"eval_count":166,"eval_duration":4942700000}
