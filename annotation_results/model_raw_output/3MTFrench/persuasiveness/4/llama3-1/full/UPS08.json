{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T20:04:28.75029181Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using relatable examples (e.g., comparing food to music) and appealing to the audience's emotions (e.g., emphasizing the importance of complex flavors). The reasoning is also rigorous, as the speaker provides concrete examples and explanations to support their arguments. Additionally, the use of personal anecdotes and storytelling helps to build a connection with the audience.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give it a perfect score because some parts of the speech may not be entirely convincing or well-supported by evidence. For instance, the claim that \"trop de notes\" (too many notes) can make food unpalatable is an assumption that might not be universally accepted. Additionally, some of the speaker's language and tone may come across as slightly too casual or playful for a formal speech.\n\nOverall, I think the speaker does a great job of engaging the audience and making their point, but could benefit from a bit more rigor and evidence in support of their claims.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3206,523,295,519,5019,5891,404,6033,13458,8941,5019,296,4091,13,356,17771,6316,3488,1744,4864,757,36731,71151,1153,8047,11,1880,4864,841,63762,6502,9189,11,10071,41091,1206,12267,479,11,4864,2145,5019,296,4091,13,16062,16081,11,272,17771,665,67781,1647,36252,1291,11,4864,60534,13,34447,6666,11,4864,841,60534,6502,308,6,94896,75249,13,14465,60534,951,1589,66474,951,1446,417,72476,1900,13,19421,22299,4864,36731,342,414,1969,11,503,26248,547,379,92528,2743,951,4411,346,12249,409,3273,404,3869,326,55624,57663,13,19421,409,1208,523,5048,12303,3869,1208,5355,4618,1765,514,21273,355,13,19421,1370,86633,27584,951,912,285,47003,31070,1291,13,356,17771,7970,11,9189,47592,1913,13,6178,72,28463,13,34447,7970,11,4864,9189,1860,818,11,9189,12584,89,757,13510,11,42287,11,272,17771,5636,60019,6316,1589,25253,951,1446,417,8065,72476,266,13,356,17771,409,1055,84,21965,6485,68,13,7695,379,264,21965,294,6,287,81,15433,4167,13,10619,13,14465,9189,1208,1867,451,13,1952,1826,5636,1765,3930,908,978,7802,648,13,19421,97507,11,9189,47592,73173,11,653,908,978,7802,648,3869,4972,72,11,272,17771,5636,6485,68,934,31109,1589,25253,951,1446,417,72476,1900,13,34447,1826,54312,1744,20662,6485,13109,11,39043,28130,665,94721,11,272,17771,1120,1133,3846,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,3869,30517,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,9964,22011,326,52152,41116,409,1208,6485,13109,15878,274,6,269,13327,1765,3625,27389,59958,63934,288,951,1615,316,18543,1759,11,1765,26317,27389,59958,63934,288,665,20272,13,34447,934,17771,54312,1744,39043,1744,1208,6485,13109,15878,274,6,269,13327,30,2998,20272,11,272,17771,1208,10484,13109,409,37392,1744,9189,62822,19610,87158,9189,60534,89,79071,14896,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,11,42676,9189,91329,2182,89,11,6316,89669,11,1370,51173,11,9189,17782,89,3869,62822,35573,951,8554,7010,653,3738,30281,11,9952,5636,6033,40970,294,55624,729,13109,1880,76776,653,3738,35019,339,2727,13,19421,14707,11,8811,75876,43765,11,4502,56316,3625,8554,841,15132,6502,409,3625,7970,4978,13080,7010,514,7970,6141,265,11,15265,89669,841,35737,13080,11083,326,6,8039,3614,13080,18249,648,4881,13,19421,3399,41091,11,4864,66517,326,39982,1100,8942,4558,325,1744,87158,326,54386,60534,79071,14896,11,4502,56316,3900,379,264,21965,409,8554,11,6033,6502,79380,11,6033,4502,3846,841,15132,6502,3625,7970,4978,11,10071,951,1446,417,78871,13080,11083,326,6,8039,3614,13080,18249,648,4881,13,1708,1105,11,5019,296,26248,1814,7010,20662,31747,19135,2428,11,4864,42775,273,9952,951,11909,15878,274,6,269,13327,13,1252,6335,11,272,17771,26077,447,22827,1744,503,34155,1376,978,42844,51854,5347,33903,11,54401,934,35329,45441,13171,409,757,7591,68019,1880,409,11083,7889,11,5636,409,220,1272,8554,3869,10083,1617,648,1744,96642,11,951,8554,409,59811,1437,1354,11,409,72476,266,459,12339,11,409,5355,4618,93848,13,74656,97717,11,11083,7363,118904,75460,11,46152,15132,28463,2107,4893,409,757,57705,978,6091,261,11,1208,10651,409,11083,951,1446,417,13,81245,15132,296,46651,2249,11,46141,447,1821,11,21901,1821,13,19421,77433,3869,326,6,49575,409,11083,7363,978,2749,288,11,4864,94297,39929,1208,17071,100196,1370,95917,359,409,11083,951,1446,417,13,14465,94297,76826,48908,10045,261,11083,951,1446,417,11,3869,951,47104,22299,9189,1880,41091,11,54401,1744,9189,18757,74466,757,13510,11,4502,46152,15132,82134,6033,60014,100063,21965,69125,6033,6502,79380,13,19421,77433,8065,68226,409,1208,20719,2428,11,4864,94297,296,6,8039,19010,12329,1880,47929,9952,51625,1854,1208,10484,13109,409,97418,11,409,44453,1291,1880,409,912,285,47003,11,1744,42182,39929,6316,1589,25253,8065,72476,266,5019,23761,86966,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,25632,12339,1744,3846,57992,11,2486,467,11,6033,7010,3625,49301,11,3869,96586,11,45575,3846,1744,9189,60534,89,79071,14896,11,9189,73953,89,3869,41091,13,19421,9189,2486,812,11,1880,4502,308,17771,6502,21965,6485,68,6033,6502,79380,13,69327,4502,841,296,41901,1922,1188,6502,653,46110,79071,14896,11,54401,1744,9189,26365,74466,11,44829,39043,28130,7364,331,5048,89,13,25145,72,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,1375,15436,10507,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,3691,311,4731,8,323,33352,311,279,10877,596,21958,320,68,13,70,2637,82003,279,12939,315,6485,32523,570,578,33811,374,1101,47999,11,439,279,19114,
