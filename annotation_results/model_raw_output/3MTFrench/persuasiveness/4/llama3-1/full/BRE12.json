{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T21:34:06.702736129Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"un po'\", \"quel gen\"), metaphors (comparing cells to a small boat), and storytelling (sharing personal experiences). The tone is enthusiastic and engaging, making the listener feel like they're part of an exciting adventure. The speaker also uses logical reasoning, explaining complex biological concepts in simple terms.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that some parts of the speech may be difficult to follow for non-experts in biology or chemistry. Additionally, there are moments where the speaker seems more focused on sharing their personal experiences and emotions rather than providing concrete scientific evidence to support their claims.\n\nOverall, however, I believe the speaker's passion, creativity, and clear communication make this a highly persuasive speech.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,28326,6863,35737,264,44380,384,3355,459,10176,2586,348,817,264,88845,1891,30050,11,4864,10176,264,323,2223,72,653,21935,1218,554,1370,4355,4809,13,5034,4809,781,274,1617,84,13845,324,3055,841,11676,39894,1891,47862,11,3091,711,84,521,11,23744,936,53863,3567,84,2227,2423,384,1891,653,1208,4809,11,2586,21559,1208,3091,514,44229,1291,14946,26725,273,11,8162,1727,13,423,6,752,295,6491,2942,17434,11,653,374,301,360,548,34059,519,5411,11,2107,58209,1624,14814,324,451,17085,620,11,2307,5048,273,274,1149,486,1891,653,3273,6,1891,348,2957,6590,3497,458,384,4087,1208,274,5048,13,3959,6868,514,65498,653,3273,6,14814,324,451,11,4316,822,1841,11490,5048,11,1891,1946,880,17996,38450,486,11,1891,12466,6160,536,6902,548,11,1891,8249,10628,11,25568,265,653,3273,6,60534,2167,336,10216,8162,1727,13,650,3746,88423,3091,326,58736,17194,4877,747,349,273,23536,8162,1727,13,7462,450,67717,11,1077,288,689,653,5541,4042,13,5034,1156,3614,17692,519,5174,513,11676,3091,3900,274,1338,285,326,6,804,8376,1624,13612,72,11,11676,3900,11427,278,11,3900,6962,12782,292,11,99144,6,525,13464,11,3900,7230,15273,11,11676,3900,2558,285,1624,24463,11,390,33515,11,73953,72,3091,11,390,33515,261,11,274,1149,54830,11,4538,451,326,94572,19472,11,8871,11,2558,575,548,514,8162,1727,11,7643,4809,11,5347,4042,1727,13,2206,11,9964,43237,7930,1437,321,648,11,841,24068,385,13,507,49606,11,304,9955,39461,264,259,4269,11,11676,3900,841,2558,285,6733,1048,1030,11,1891,5347,1286,390,653,6,2295,10024,11,3900,282,1286,4150,462,11,8811,74350,13,1708,588,11,3738,68,297,10893,263,11,3067,653,6,5819,31756,8631,5048,11,11676,3900,470,62867,11,52608,295,285,486,514,22337,4558,3091,649,78,274,6,2295,24201,11,7643,11676,3900,86496,486,2558,575,548,924,42723,7439,13,469,39043,11,513,514,3575,72,13,3489,301,3091,48613,2349,72,15587,70002,11,602,8413,14946,10241,519,11,47151,33614,6870,802,325,3091,513,1522,486,13,507,4355,11,4864,274,35329,6496,13,14465,36731,11751,467,1891,13550,263,486,11,2586,5203,70002,1062,689,11,3625,9680,1791,91075,384,272,7379,11,4824,942,64,1624,11,26077,4173,11,3091,1208,9680,55446,16749,514,2349,72,1647,91524,4824,67614,6,444,684,8631,5048,13,94030,648,264,29449,2307,79,22460,802,451,11,6160,1640,17434,514,74041,64,11,653,3273,518,16081,978,74041,11,26514,332,978,11,453,588,11,3738,68,6,304,1264,82,290,384,33614,6870,802,884,72,514,70002,312,76149,13,1611,8391,333,5171,486,653,3273,6,802,325,11,829,33614,6870,802,325,11,26077,4173,8413,14946,1208,70002,824,10025,23772,1891,5347,1286,3091,2536,274,6,2295,24201,13,469,514,4173,11,36897,824,1208,92807,15363,28071,70002,13,1252,3273,6,802,325,11,2586,83264,514,326,6,12828,343,299,351,11,514,1541,261,11,2536,274,52152,496,1791,91075,11,1208,282,41816,2558,556,11,514,22337,4558,3091,11640,3091,2536,274,6,2295,24201,384,97589,66,486,602,2558,556,13,1556,8510,11,326,6,12828,343,299,351,348,2159,4558,11457,556,2586,2219,295,275,5308,483,11,3091,1380,1768,3458,11,11676,603,6,1608,6,264,17634,486,514,70809,5636,29340,11,5636,2047,11,4647,6,1097,10097,78,11676,11,6697,822,325,11,15890,6863,11,348,2453,263,11,9234,78,6,459,11,26514,541,72,13,5034,436,1088,11676,64514,326,54386,11,7643,11,1922,689,72,41091,11,11586,6388,92917,11,653,40586,264,436,535,13,94030,648,264,44380,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,87068,7766,1778,439,54515,3573,359,3273,23612,330,43014,4173,4063,31768,1105,320,884,45252,7917,311,264,2678,15688,705,323,48929,320,84746,4443,11704,570,578,16630,374,42702,323,23387,11,3339,279,11700,2733,1093,814,2351,961,315,459,13548,18427,13,578,19114,1101,5829,20406,33811,11,26073,6485,24156,19476,304,4382,3878,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,433,264,220,20,704,315,220,20,374,430,1063,5596,315,279,8982,1253,387,5107,311,1833,369,2536,18882,15916,304,34458,477,30903,13,23212,11,1070,527,14269,1405,279,19114,5084,810,10968,389,11821,872,4443,11704,323,21958,4856,1109,8405,14509,12624,6029,311,1862,872,8349,627,198,28589,11,4869,11,358,4510,279,19114,596,11939,11,28697,11,323,2867,10758,1304,420,264,7701,66343,8982,13,128009],"total_duration":44999062539,"load_duration":209292,"prompt_eval_count":843,"prompt_eval_duration":3786371000,"eval_count":187,"eval_duration":41212034000}
