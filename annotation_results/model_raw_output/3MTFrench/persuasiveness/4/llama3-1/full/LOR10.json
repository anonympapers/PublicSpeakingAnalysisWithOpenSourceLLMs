Additionally, the speaker's tone is somewhat formal and lacks a strong emotional appeal, which could reduce the impact of their message.\n\nOverall, while there are some minor flaws, the speaker does an excellent job of conveying their ideas in a clear and convincing manner.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7930,1370,8318,9189,308,26248,56316,513,24560,74282,66014,4538,264,43406,11,7930,308,26248,56316,25774,1208,10485,34395,77818,817,6293,375,409,4538,8486,5019,7643,961,11,4864,259,6960,409,27389,4120,326,6,5389,404,409,1208,369,49530,93424,13,1708,1105,97507,11,3869,3846,357,1037,11,45441,9189,841,296,41901,7591,11,10071,3900,841,92215,6502,96308,27389,3826,37572,4502,389,1323,546,265,653,9880,665,55520,11,14896,12266,11,45441,9189,294,3695,10071,3869,75249,272,17771,54312,1744,1208,369,49530,274,53149,46651,2536,1880,9189,47592,86966,1133,73173,13,5034,10484,13109,409,66304,409,1208,369,49530,93424,19861,12826,41199,74699,5636,409,220,3965,8261,11,10071,653,8137,409,342,9011,2392,20662,14425,24918,369,49530,357,12339,11,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,27058,47929,3869,26077,1486,3625,369,5615,2641,15132,348,359,404,3869,96721,21430,11843,78432,2428,11,3900,1826,100243,294,6,8322,13154,28130,18111,324,13,4366,51173,11,4502,514,312,331,283,479,1826,46481,26633,26633,1099,5512,294,6,3457,220,508,8261,11,4068,3625,369,5615,2641,82133,23761,9517,351,404,13,2998,390,46302,3846,18111,324,17317,5019,26692,1097,73511,15171,326,6,351,7709,369,49530,357,12339,54401,294,31769,1126,3625,369,5615,2641,3869,296,31769,10036,1430,45973,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,2998,4799,285,519,11,1370,51173,11,3625,32118,5317,288,82711,87437,4635,333,4558,8135,7010,12155,369,5615,2641,13,27058,74282,66014,326,6,5389,404,409,1208,369,49530,11,4864,259,6,285,2536,6502,6316,30870,273,409,69084,3916,11,10071,653,38553,324,409,14425,24918,13,24703,38553,324,1826,13171,409,27389,3826,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,37923,409,1208,369,49530,93424,11,10071,4864,514,19724,3209,30052,294,93825,6316,4839,68,13,3206,436,57332,11412,23761,409,1208,32118,747,15171,13,27058,45602,11,4864,11412,60946,265,4502,326,58736,17194,951,3541,1354,3869,1208,14425,24918,369,49530,357,12339,13,48109,5019,3209,2439,75804,88253,934,35329,389,29253,26633,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,369,49530,27549,98375,11,1841,17258,1169,514,17258,346,11,17258,1169,1880,1167,569,82133,23761,665,75332,684,3625,1354,9952,3625,46106,5019,326,69537,12416,3869,1208,41263,20712,13,4366,51173,11,42067,24560,9189,12584,89,3869,1208,86451,1880,1744,73103,63484,1826,56662,409,38900,11,9189,12584,89,23761,665,75332,684,5019,48021,15265,4958,3978,668,8065,13612,321,13,2009,2132,22944,35977,87264,3625,3369,1441,3930,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,7695,513,4790,9425,306,1370,514,79885,951,2798,14081,2859,1880,1370,6316,48416,1516,409,326,93847,55852,13,1050,1055,2439,1765,20662,86451,11,9189,62299,1370,1055,84,3869,1153,261,15265,4958,3978,668,8065,13612,321,13,43987,26178,11,3900,20272,220,2983,1099,5512,1880,9189,308,6,52659,6502,294,93847,13,432,5512,495,266,9189,31547,5512,13,2998,5589,11,9189,9189,281,5615,35115,13,1708,1105,11,4068,47929,4502,27750,26633,1343,98078,4558,4978,9517,112916,79738,6033,2536,11,1208,14425,24918,409,1208,369,49530,93424,30,27058,45602,11,27549,1826,409,98652,7033,978,8637,2428,13,14465,91507,57110,911,261,3625,3369,1441,409,1208,75332,684,1880,66090,3930,2609,1133,11,1880,66090,3930,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,7010,514,92892,11067,13,2998,7591,42551,3625,47590,11,834,2439,665,220,777,1490,11,44829,665,2515,28674,54606,5553,514,18111,324,55398,81991,75804,88253,11,4864,94297,93455,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,550,15433,635,1370,514,92892,11067,9952,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,9517,301,1001,409,4958,3978,668,409,12155,49301,13,12095,3625,27389,2400,82,15132,4495,288,11,503,6,4202,2192,3608,90859,1208,75332,684,9465,3625,305,58566,1880,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,11,22299,14240,519,14707,951,1448,598,11,3869,326,6,4683,10722,409,1208,369,49530,93424,13,4366,1208,16578,11,389,1826,2515,28674,951,20492,1765,220,508,11,220,1135,1880,27584,220,1041,8261,13,2009,92892,11067,29557,2221,409,18728,34858,10253,1499,3457,31539,294,6,20311,3625,13033,919,665,26305,42463,951,19266,1072,1220,409,1913,11,1841,6316,37291,6502,220,5599,747,8047,11,10071,272,17771,294,6,9011,2727,1744,3846,15132,12155,60020,30179,812,7930,19477,9425,306,514,38900,409,2486,467,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1473,9,81200,3230,10507,311,41468,872,3585,320,68,13,70,2637,279,10937,369,40120,323,5070,1990,2204,9606,8,198,9,12362,
