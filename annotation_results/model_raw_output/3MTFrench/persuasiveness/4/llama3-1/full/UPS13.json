{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T20:04:19.67709903Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of Pierre-Vage's speech as 4 out of 5 (very much). Here's why:\n\n* Pierre-Vage effectively uses storytelling techniques to engage his audience. He shares a personal anecdote about finding the answer to his thesis question with a laser and draws parallels between guiding lightning and human behavior.\n* He presents a clear and concise explanation of the scientific concept behind guiding lightning, making it accessible to a non-technical audience.\n* Pierre-Vage uses rhetorical devices such as metaphors (comparing charges to humans) and vivid imagery (describing the stormy weather) to create an immersive experience for his listeners.\n* His enthusiasm and passion for his research are palpable, which helps to build trust with his audience.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give it a perfect score of 5 because:\n\n* The speech could benefit from more concrete examples or data to support Pierre-Vage's claims. While he provides some context about the prototype being three times more powerful than the previous one, more specific details would strengthen his argument.\n* Some parts of the speech feel overly dramatic, such as when he says \"vous allez vous y pr√©cipiter\" (you will rush in that direction). While this creates a sense of urgency, it also borders on sensationalism.\n\nOverall, Pierre-Vage's speech is engaging, clear, and well-structured, making him a persuasive speaker.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,11,4864,36731,38077,20198,425,1880,4864,9189,31025,4618,409,9189,1046,299,9211,1841,9189,4046,3532,74466,45325,3869,11083,72070,5512,11,7643,270,4558,325,665,220,5245,2132,288,11,4068,15132,1370,1208,1913,949,29083,9952,41091,37953,409,1208,88818,14240,2070,3930,46494,95199,268,11,21120,33538,5754,11,17317,74533,665,220,508,508,1765,6316,20605,24812,3869,5636,409,220,914,410,296,75104,11,514,10594,5945,544,273,7591,331,10610,8047,1208,121696,648,2840,33211,11,23828,8047,7010,29449,671,462,1880,61387,8047,11,17317,4046,6232,2439,514,1437,3159,1327,35285,554,274,55624,729,3125,11,3625,2107,668,1759,274,82405,5049,306,11,1208,24408,20605,68,11,272,17771,514,4545,17634,519,3284,326,6,6802,9769,2641,13,3489,6870,665,20272,949,14465,841,348,11206,2852,6502,35597,13510,11,29449,719,35737,4382,11,6155,9769,1565,1208,282,3023,265,758,12535,9189,7631,10333,39043,949,61651,14707,5019,3846,20028,11,7930,259,6,546,1208,20605,24812,3869,1323,546,519,514,27138,5019,514,65385,409,7643,270,4558,325,87158,503,34155,100162,1208,90509,9952,653,21120,13,2009,82660,3527,409,9840,425,409,1208,282,3023,265,1826,294,49963,12329,653,21120,4502,653,27138,934,35329,379,264,6316,21120,1765,4538,21765,11,34280,519,6316,15235,818,409,32426,5019,82810,10515,408,265,3869,5636,294,31109,2960,8511,409,296,75104,13,24703,32426,11,31807,360,51137,665,653,40021,294,6,1334,32592,1773,685,9952,41091,409,79165,7836,598,11,514,39474,9952,3625,951,10405,13,61651,14707,11,272,17771,1744,3625,10405,98151,462,14295,15132,653,28800,22299,17317,13,4072,645,308,6,2706,306,14707,841,6502,23761,14545,64591,66021,934,35329,264,77558,27549,1880,76776,84568,15132,4905,16156,288,13,4418,66,13085,89,45325,11,934,54386,264,9071,978,294,41901,7591,65,3102,2439,45575,1744,9189,62299,3577,978,11,107954,467,1133,11,934,80720,16869,9008,653,21120,1880,7558,519,1208,3682,13109,951,4160,42204,1765,1208,4160,648,294,69537,35657,978,13,41621,12584,89,9189,379,51625,575,2058,11,2536,949,7777,97507,11,9189,12584,89,9189,379,51625,575,2058,13,19421,3625,10405,98151,462,14295,409,326,6,2747,23828,4558,8135,7010,28130,11148,425,11,389,20028,409,27584,513,51625,575,2058,7010,1208,5216,1744,4864,28130,21559,42676,4864,28130,21559,13,19421,4502,45602,1826,20272,11,272,17771,86966,13,41621,9189,436,74466,76385,978,1208,282,3023,265,87451,934,80720,1826,57485,11,39015,39723,9189,55162,41881,409,27389,59958,16271,653,842,69596,69241,72,409,2107,668,324,1880,76776,326,6,3342,5615,9211,409,55035,1765,3625,26467,3869,1760,978,1414,13,34447,4864,3355,729,294,49963,12329,514,3044,8301,11,9189,264,68490,84228,16339,13,3341,294,6,370,541,11,9189,12584,89,409,35573,4287,261,409,45347,56321,8261,9952,41091,3869,58673,15610,13,24703,308,17771,6502,4502,4382,409,1709,1814,1208,282,3023,265,13,1952,4046,61673,42775,409,31837,41199,5636,409,220,868,8261,11,10071,20662,37291,11,27549,264,9517,3928,3625,8232,77660,11909,21120,11,34280,519,665,25018,220,18,220,931,37291,5636,18757,1056,1821,1744,514,62891,842,63734,13,3959,11909,665,36252,89577,2322,73468,653,72601,5019,11083,7889,16968,4046,49272,3869,5636,409,220,868,13437,90053,409,29449,10353,294,57286,799,13,19421,76776,41091,11,7930,39904,11083,503,3514,14014,11,6316,48901,409,11083,11148,1220,11,264,86595,978,951,951,10405,409,46939,5636,409,220,17,296,75104,409,1317,54401,409,46524,3625,908,729,513,34280,519,9465,3625,21120,11,3625,649,1147,934,85217,34280,64,1188,1880,3625,951,10405,13,362,5589,409,46524,39015,11,68225,5512,665,342,3326,5048,11,7930,308,6,546,29557,2221,409,20028,10390,655,1208,282,3023,265,6316,37291,2922,6496,8065,1765,1208,20605,24812,13,34447,11,5019,39929,326,6,4683,65679,2458,1604,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,3355,729,35597,9189,97448,653,46110,79071,14896,1744,503,49152,2852,824,1072,14240,519,33632,519,11,10071,1744,4864,9517,83,66867,2852,11,653,5457,409,42775,3869,1181,1195,13,24703,1744,4864,5320,2249,9189,13510,1880,272,17771,25945,3062,13,356,17771,934,6,88423,6316,8198,11,272,17771,653,1446,265,1880,7591,23827,978,13,432,4168,266,11,294,6,533,258,3284,758,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,38077,20198,425,596,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,320,1225,1790,570,5810,596,3249,1473,9,38077,20198,425,13750,5829,48929,12823,311,16988,813,10877,13,1283,13551,264,4443,50750,1295,922,9455,279,4320,311,813,17850,34
