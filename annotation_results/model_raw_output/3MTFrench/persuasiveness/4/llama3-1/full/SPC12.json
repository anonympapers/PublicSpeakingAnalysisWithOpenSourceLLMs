{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T20:11:26.029617441Z","response":"Based on the provided transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by:\n\n* Providing a clear overview of their work and its significance\n* Sharing specific examples to illustrate the complexity of medical records and the importance of analyzing them\n* Highlighting the potential benefits of personalized medicine, such as improved treatment outcomes and reduced healthcare costs\n* Emphasizing the need for innovation and data-driven approaches in the field of medicine\n\nThe speaker's reasoning appears rigorous, as they:\n\n* Break down complex concepts into understandable parts (e.g., structured vs. unstructured data)\n* Use specific statistics to support their claims (e.g., 1% of documents contain \"hidden temporalities\")\n* Present a compelling vision for the future of personalized medicine and its potential impact on healthcare\n\nHowever, I would not give it a perfect score (5 out of 5) because:\n\n* The speech is quite technical, which might make it challenging for non-experts to follow\n* There are some minor issues with clarity and coherence (e.g., the speaker jumps between different ideas without fully developing each one)\n\nOverall, I think the speaker presents a compelling case for the importance of personalized medicine and their work in this area.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,19421,46152,86696,15132,294,6,1662,6,14107,288,13,9589,54312,1744,9189,45366,28605,1208,1925,4502,9189,47592,46939,8666,978,653,32118,8332,258,949,41621,841,3665,89,25692,85815,6502,11,10071,3869,3846,4545,2922,6496,11,46152,14848,89532,653,39474,35030,950,1765,9189,13,19421,1647,42775,6824,68,3869,79196,52424,27750,44827,5019,13253,8065,64972,514,18111,324,89714,15890,9189,9189,9517,54681,519,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,32118,8332,483,97252,35965,8047,13,7695,9279,325,60697,11,1647,1665,333,409,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,409,16456,496,52750,15265,87810,35030,292,1604,13,12535,4864,296,59858,35456,82,949,46706,326,39982,9769,79,2223,39723,4864,42775,273,11,17317,57038,550,5615,2641,409,348,76019,8261,294,6,26125,35030,292,1604,5708,978,15890,550,5615,2641,409,220,605,11990,409,7477,3476,35030,3074,2249,11,11751,5512,9952,41091,7010,514,96839,3930,2466,828,13,27058,8678,805,27750,46681,11,4864,3625,3512,1082,665,409,38546,2138,31355,11,3625,46681,2080,324,14014,1880,3625,46681,2536,2080,324,14014,13,27058,3625,46681,2080,324,14014,11,3846,15132,951,44827,69406,11,19227,1744,514,9859,3930,35030,950,296,98146,652,285,6033,3625,3369,1441,2132,17724,594,25526,1188,1370,514,8893,13,62463,44827,15132,51794,3869,8678,805,1841,84568,15132,5708,14014,7010,665,57234,13,1252,5891,29097,5019,3625,46681,2536,2080,324,14014,513,15132,3625,7477,3476,35030,3074,2249,13,19421,272,17771,326,6,533,68,6033,3846,4684,76366,13,50501,44424,3900,379,264,51854,4595,409,7477,3476,11,951,1095,45632,11,951,6155,438,355,409,71546,5673,648,6033,409,523,17083,6033,35597,951,6141,27476,3095,409,18488,13,34447,27750,1495,288,687,72,89810,951,44827,62623,288,19227,1744,3625,45455,4558,8696,3930,32118,8332,258,1765,514,8893,6033,35597,3625,2457,1206,5512,951,29060,934,35329,264,1207,72,13,27058,8678,805,27750,1495,288,11,4864,91507,75144,951,12384,288,1744,503,53149,7218,2192,6033,30682,13,19421,665,42587,519,27750,704,8839,11,4864,91507,409,35573,14049,424,653,951,38546,3369,1441,409,326,6,44803,325,409,2246,7930,3613,68495,326,6,92677,951,293,90276,37015,35933,13,9424,688,3625,32118,8332,1354,7930,14848,951,6978,1448,978,17187,82133,20028,951,6293,1291,4631,5512,9465,3625,7477,3476,3930,8893,5019,22641,261,6316,11917,409,4538,7135,2428,35030,292,1604,13,24703,7930,513,39904,1370,51173,11,9189,75090,46206,15265,32118,8332,258,514,220,868,94811,220,679,20,1880,9189,47592,6316,59904,3930,46496,1880,7010,514,39474,514,32118,8332,258,11412,4046,68019,11,4864,1685,38096,220,18,5347,33903,409,220,18,5347,33903,294,6,1617,301,13,220,19,8261,5636,62197,11,9189,19443,10333,5019,653,8811,409,98477,1880,39015,3900,11412,6293,1291,4631,261,1208,17571,91329,1269,220,19,8261,5636,259,35657,10071,15878,737,7211,265,1208,2457,13,2009,32118,8332,258,10484,7107,39043,1880,3625,2262,1880,1208,4538,87810,35030,292,1604,13,34447,514,296,2003,10071,704,321,10484,333,546,78551,3846,69067,11,46152,82133,60946,265,1744,514,32118,8332,258,11412,18027,261,15265,8811,409,98477,665,9189,1488,519,304,1617,301,13,19421,39043,11,272,17771,39043,1744,3846,35737,3738,1133,25945,10878,3869,1062,1291,13,19421,7010,1647,704,321,11,503,34155,5965,90859,39043,409,293,90276,37015,35933,13,622,34155,20272,6316,49586,409,27750,6293,4918,4631,5512,1765,220,5067,220,931,1495,288,1880,503,34155,100162,1744,220,16,4,409,27750,9477,57485,14014,665,293,90276,37015,35933,13,432,8778,978,3869,11083,33651,2249,220,605,11990,409,9477,11,39043,20272,84364,409,220,1041,220,931,1495,288,7930,15132,36875,13327,1001,1651,21938,1370,3846,98576,13,4418,66,272,17771,39587,653,14707,296,11305,324,3869,59394,665,42463,37953,409,1208,43738,409,15265,87810,35030,292,1604,13,39783,37291,1744,4864,1446,2192,13171,409,20028,39043,11,4864,5019,41098,7591,5589,404,951,53454,4595,1370,1853,9268,1880,3869,3846,1744,272,17771,39043,3869,951,9781,1224,812,13,1219,2727,39043,11,42676,653,43453,11939,17782,11,4864,5019,41098,51794,479,11744,261,665,25400,1488,519,3625,9781,1224,812,7930,78871,1675,10746,556,28463,13,4418,66,42676,9517,1264,978,11,77433,3869,26317,46681,11,45347,1880,30179,6960,17317,58673,484,2439,5019,514,18111,324,1208,2373,220,17,13,15,409,1208,32118,8332,483,409,51625,1854,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,3984,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,19
