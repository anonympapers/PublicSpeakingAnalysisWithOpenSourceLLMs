Additionally, some points may seem a bit too optimistic or simplistic, which could be addressed with more nuanced reasoning.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2009,20680,74466,45325,11,42138,514,426,13559,258,13952,1291,11,3869,386,5639,3675,11,514,26633,90272,5636,25626,426,13559,258,13952,1291,3930,38900,1880,514,426,13559,258,3930,54932,13,19421,514,24664,263,11,66517,519,48901,3930,426,13559,258,3930,54932,11,39587,514,24664,263,2278,4558,451,653,36875,13327,13952,1291,82653,2428,296,41901,25817,82585,13,2998,220,1049,24,11,514,85182,40280,56979,27476,978,35881,4849,294,6,2295,67,1220,326,6,1562,367,409,4538,66304,11,32592,57128,409,1099,3972,5553,3625,21935,4046,376,14381,13,356,17771,35881,1854,3930,24664,263,264,15925,42676,27584,6502,1744,259,77025,3682,13,2998,326,6,19729,32199,409,1208,18475,1880,294,31769,32348,8082,409,326,6,3768,3930,66304,11,272,17771,7930,1826,14707,13,2998,26633,11,326,6,19729,32199,3930,8286,951,7591,331,1441,409,66304,308,6,546,14448,69068,11,272,17771,7930,1826,60014,100063,13,362,25400,89429,355,409,3846,738,266,11,17317,841,74533,1153,5512,1208,3488,409,47929,13,34447,26077,91116,11,15878,628,1291,31914,580,11,2231,2439,42587,978,5019,14448,12329,20662,58758,3709,10670,648,220,1187,76145,1765,220,1187,1370,3625,19647,409,1208,55133,1880,409,1208,26633,90272,18475,3930,66304,3930,24664,263,11,8065,89175,1880,409,326,6,511,283,102843,665,54008,1291,13,2998,67781,11,326,6,511,283,52274,43989,653,66304,7930,2278,4558,451,653,36875,13327,82653,2428,4046,20609,68,11,44829,593,3846,66304,1826,42587,978,41199,951,35881,2734,552,5019,829,60128,84228,447,481,3869,326,82405,12267,9517,65982,409,45973,501,582,2852,294,58736,5997,6960,60128,13,64105,64,348,14210,1744,1208,84850,4558,21152,1370,69,372,14081,8047,11,9052,423,2521,11,69152,1208,31807,483,11,1672,84,648,3930,66304,409,4020,1195,5019,1208,57459,8065,1486,409,15907,1370,69,1354,1880,1744,20662,31807,483,1826,48488,42587,8047,7010,514,96839,409,1208,15430,1132,38469,1880,409,1208,7591,43011,38469,13,426,1116,11,5019,312,59976,265,3869,1208,3488,409,1153,261,11,26633,4905,3928,5512,10253,4905,3928,5512,274,41901,809,4978,13,72334,31539,409,85722,15858,13215,8047,1880,8581,8065,24664,263,3625,22337,20243,2482,294,55624,14081,49530,13,622,6,306,1438,1370,40970,514,2445,2482,294,55624,14081,49530,11,3625,10062,15112,3145,11,19227,934,80720,1826,10415,306,11,5019,665,20028,951,1008,5512,22589,11,49554,82,414,66,5512,11,13171,409,21425,12329,9952,951,1008,5512,22589,3869,2385,3930,9517,76701,11,12155,84064,417,3869,1317,98020,5019,326,6,87713,1880,4538,50026,40280,13,14465,63762,11,7970,9859,294,22827,16968,9189,11,3846,62163,11,272,17771,7155,11,259,6,300,5392,788,13,2009,259,9011,1215,1826,653,16812,951,348,19395,978,2629,2249,7930,503,34155,326,6,269,1286,409,32118,6323,337,3695,2132,17724,13,64105,64,76605,13510,409,9313,409,326,6,9011,21152,45973,3625,945,676,437,16011,288,11,15890,3625,38831,283,688,3682,275,17724,78199,7010,3625,4046,7857,13,8602,3516,11,514,259,9011,1215,1826,653,1218,1291,11677,7930,63922,668,45973,514,17536,484,50753,13,1952,514,38831,83384,7010,514,259,9011,1215,11,1744,17317,1615,316,24483,8065,99568,3675,1880,76776,7010,514,387,84,11,389,348,14210,39723,4864,841,4580,2933,13,5034,26633,90272,4905,3928,978,7930,274,41901,809,3458,11,1826,1208,57459,8065,1486,294,52152,90604,13,2577,285,11,88247,2428,11,665,296,19010,853,519,11,409,1208,4502,554,409,66304,11,3869,1208,4502,554,409,88247,2428,5019,665,20028,653,7363,83353,13,1252,7363,83353,11,42587,481,7010,326,6,485,592,7379,409,1208,8246,13,62408,4186,8082,951,7591,331,1441,88247,8467,29557,2221,409,11091,1291,9465,46106,514,80259,409,1208,2536,2427,978,49363,951,7591,331,1441,11,7930,1826,653,45165,23349,1344,978,2933,11,503,34155,22011,14707,653,45165,23349,1344,978,2933,5019,3625,21935,665,4160,648,951,68866,3808,13,2998,5589,11,9189,1391,48009,89,3846,1744,4864,66517,8065,9511,67763,74699,13,622,34155,34280,978,11,653,264,951,6348,1880,653,28814,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1473,9,28757,449,264,9903,430,49155,279,10877,596,6666,320,1820,2132,68067,13952,304,279,1917,8,198,9,81200,2317,323,4092,2038,311,5813,38769,198,9,57094,287,279,7100,4754,315,279,24664,263,2423,13952,5064,198,9,27740,287,1403,10708,369,14448,2065,25,17332,6108,1008,17082,1924,323,28814,7384,198,9,7073,66,4522,279,77
