Establishing a personal connection with the audience by sharing their own experience and passion for entrepreneurship.\n2. Providing a clear and concise overview of the issue (the high number of business failures in France) and its consequences (judicial proceedings, etc.).\n3. Presenting different scenarios and profiles of entrepreneurs who have gone through bankruptcy proceedings, which helps to illustrate the complexities and nuances of the issue.\n4. Showing empathy for the entrepreneurs who have failed, highlighting the human side of the story rather than just focusing on statistics.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give a perfect score is that the speaker's tone can come across as somewhat academic or theoretical at times, which might make it harder for some audience members to connect with the message. However, overall, the speech is well-structured, easy to follow, and effectively conveys the importance of understanding the social dynamics surrounding business failures in France.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,19610,45325,46939,23423,978,3869,75831,15265,93486,1880,409,43406,29349,30,2998,20272,11,4864,9189,17477,1208,3488,66021,1744,272,17771,514,4865,5019,5636,294,52152,5006,1765,220,18,13,19421,436,5615,19610,409,75831,4538,93486,409,1208,20028,18434,265,11,409,1208,20028,6800,404,13,19421,14707,389,665,6033,2067,648,1744,272,17771,93486,11,28800,67683,404,13,19421,39015,9189,9189,294,3695,11,9604,39043,11,39043,20272,653,28800,14425,593,10237,13,19421,14707,11,3869,47371,2784,294,93825,514,14425,593,10237,11,503,34155,326,77025,40807,409,50859,13,19421,4864,36731,1208,86806,7010,1208,15983,38469,93424,11,3869,14240,664,1291,3625,20272,288,294,6,88988,13,3959,97263,7930,308,6,546,5636,79380,294,6,77217,5019,70375,28130,2144,554,11,28130,4371,12267,1880,43153,3242,9769,2641,13,2998,9822,11,3846,1343,98078,48099,71925,6960,665,52138,26193,220,16,11,22,4,409,29449,5708,294,6,88988,13,19421,272,17771,8065,63992,409,36754,1744,39043,513,39904,13,356,17771,326,6,16094,6960,324,86100,11,6316,37291,1744,3625,97263,14848,20272,20272,288,13,220,18,67239,5512,1765,24304,2629,74553,11,23761,326,31769,447,307,978,11,23761,2579,676,978,11,6033,23761,33254,588,22641,978,13,19421,14707,1647,42775,409,15983,77828,6824,68,3869,35881,371,261,326,6,49575,409,1208,13826,25108,818,5860,24985,556,409,27750,56321,13988,978,1072,417,1880,1647,1665,333,1826,409,60946,265,4068,3625,7477,3476,12288,83391,15132,1651,978,9110,14014,11,5088,268,1157,6033,5790,10676,14014,13,3489,17771,54312,934,80720,264,22011,949,19421,14707,7643,3488,11,23761,47929,4502,3625,97263,665,2267,635,15132,12,37907,16968,951,4046,70,3916,77558,1208,12437,13,19421,3846,11,79071,45441,28130,62827,11,28130,31237,12844,294,6,9035,13109,6033,35597,11,326,6,4775,483,75107,951,5534,7404,1821,13,1708,1105,11,3613,81,4558,79507,11,3900,379,264,653,4545,1744,3625,7930,296,26248,54008,67882,92759,5512,11,272,17771,326,6,8039,1873,13,27058,14707,60946,265,11,6669,3394,653,28800,1208,1156,48099,13,77533,10670,1744,9189,779,9188,89,3869,1208,3703,3930,63992,9952,665,3663,409,9189,11,56321,23200,288,1880,514,71602,519,409,1208,51223,9780,37526,13,9605,5534,74466,45325,11,5019,3327,72684,1880,1120,3125,11,514,20272,1744,15265,93486,45441,665,2267,635,949,77533,10670,35597,1744,9189,779,9188,89,409,326,49455,265,81337,409,1208,3703,11,69379,1744,23200,288,13,8242,75249,949,426,13559,324,74466,45325,26317,35881,6948,949,19421,14707,11,653,16628,9465,27750,26633,9875,11412,2605,78,16339,951,19973,417,294,6,69175,85114,13,19421,514,60697,514,5636,1448,978,17187,11,6033,513,2503,8977,3625,25945,98385,97263,11,4864,5534,2852,934,35329,264,653,81337,653,28800,7643,2267,635,665,220,5245,2132,288,11,6033,23933,10333,56321,4520,1880,326,6,88988,1826,12046,579,13,19421,3900,379,264,28463,514,60697,39723,3625,26633,9875,5811,306,9952,3625,5975,82,3930,1742,2807,307,2428,11,1647,93486,409,73870,290,77,370,3869,2267,635,1046,974,951,220,605,220,931,35881,12416,409,40970,665,9822,326,6,85335,88818,13,19421,44829,11,503,34155,52579,46777,5803,266,3930,23496,4088,11,503,34155,19266,19484,978,11,1880,503,34155,5363,978,85114,9547,11,22299,514,16354,3930,5534,7404,519,6033,35597,4538,45740,2530,85505,13,19421,503,34155,19477,3159,3846,934,54386,25692,76190,978,951,2848,8839,4595,409,2267,635,294,6,88988,13,4366,51173,11,665,9466,519,3625,45740,2530,1772,2269,64,635,951,5534,7404,1821,11,503,34155,18757,46131,514,53454,409,326,6,40997,56405,653,9880,29349,44093,11,294,49455,978,294,22827,6864,3674,4046,3532,978,11,65268,11,8065,53454,220,18,35,11,220,18,35,5019,25549,11,7591,4099,1880,87885,35657,409,20934,276,13,426,1116,11,8065,1620,11,9952,11083,100246,13,19421,14707,272,17771,653,43453,523,83908,682,285,1744,503,34155,6033,1653,1765,3625,20272,288,294,6,88988,11,665,1647,376,519,1744,3625,20272,288,294,6,88988,841,2322,73468,6502,665,2267,635,12155,304,978,16876,35933,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,3146,19,334,704,315,220,20,369,24613,300,13071,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,512,198,16,13,40498,287,264,4443,3717,449,279,10877,555,11821,872,1866,3217,323,11939,369,75505,13,198,17,13,81200,264,2867,323,64694,24131,315,279,4360,320,1820,1579,1396,315,2626,28950,304,9822,8,323,1202,16296,320,18631,7235,29407,11,5099,36434,198,18,13,27740,287,2204,26350,323,21542,315,35490,889,617,8208,1555,
