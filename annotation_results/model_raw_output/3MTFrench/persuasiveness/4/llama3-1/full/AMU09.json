{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T20:09:16.327275759Z","response":"I will evaluate the transcript according to the provided dimensions.\n\n**Persuasiveness**: I would rate the speech's persuasiveness as **4/5**. The speaker uses vivid imagery, metaphors (e.g., \"le cochon\"), and analogies (e.g., comparing humans to sea creatures) to convey their message effectively. They also use repetition (\"la morale que je vais vous compter\") and rhetorical questions (\"Est-ce qu'on est les fonds de mer ou un cochon?\") to engage the audience. However, the speech's persuasive power could be enhanced by providing more concrete examples and evidence to support their claims.\n\n**Rigor of reasoning**: I would rate the speaker's reasoning as **3/5**. While they provide some logical connections between their ideas (e.g., \"Un d'huitablement, le seul comportement dit que notre amourcer est celui d'omanger\"), their argumentation is not always rigorous or well-supported. For example, they make general statements about the importance of adapting to environmental changes without providing concrete examples or data. Additionally, some of their claims (e.g., \"Les temps sont aux Ã©tudes et explications\") seem more like rhetorical flourishes than genuine insights.\n\n**Overall score**: Based on these evaluations, I would give the speech a score of **3.5/5**.\n\nPlease note that this evaluation is subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives and cultural contexts.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,50501,69,481,1744,17317,57038,15925,3869,917,9484,265,665,9822,1744,9189,14240,74466,409,2800,261,13,3489,301,14295,61365,409,2807,265,11,2847,288,11,10071,76776,13,19421,97507,11,326,58591,10020,13,34447,4864,63762,934,35329,29253,6316,63683,1744,9189,308,6,52659,6502,15925,1208,6140,294,53149,9484,265,13,356,6853,409,1208,9765,125067,5741,1744,4864,91507,9189,55056,261,13,445,31769,8532,409,4809,1826,514,80181,263,13,1252,72006,7643,66014,1880,3625,21901,82,409,4809,11,42138,951,46415,7010,326,6,511,978,276,11,43989,409,54606,665,4751,288,11,1080,3168,978,294,22827,4046,376,853,33013,42625,13,1252,10594,265,2249,80181,263,274,6,3342,333,14687,13,7695,274,6,1138,37093,6502,5019,274,59858,265,41546,716,13,6344,10367,951,26495,4918,294,31769,764,437,13109,288,11,7930,264,326,31769,376,853,14113,68,5019,75249,389,326,6,20243,541,1826,44351,7591,8890,69068,13,8242,342,414,1969,82,11,42067,31260,15890,4864,36731,94616,978,11,29557,653,6800,3091,588,2249,2922,332,409,36252,664,1291,13,423,6,60917,12416,27750,13510,11,665,42067,665,54008,1291,11,1208,81695,281,4558,325,1765,514,83229,68255,10065,1291,13,11876,27138,15132,10253,14240,29246,1880,1367,10939,11,81186,409,12155,75601,2601,294,83508,3904,367,13,2009,3703,65,361,25692,46932,265,26725,11083,7591,64635,1880,45575,93455,86374,8637,81235,3625,1376,288,409,11083,628,647,5512,409,11083,54409,12760,13,7695,296,26248,44314,978,294,6,58158,951,38682,919,11,4160,321,6496,3625,78199,294,31109,2917,648,817,409,13901,13,34447,3900,264,90096,978,3869,39929,3608,90859,56321,94527,1912,288,409,52962,3808,409,628,647,978,13,76022,11,4864,7591,1189,25945,2848,2159,42625,13,452,554,514,7591,85,7246,5019,45740,414,404,5636,3625,4046,49974,11,3625,3709,3433,64,484,4893,1612,1149,80463,958,981,1821,9465,41091,1880,3625,58883,38448,15890,4864,36731,274,6,333,13283,13,10106,11,4502,10484,13109,409,463,8696,2109,31539,6033,4502,3625,2126,1821,3355,89810,3869,7364,65,290,1215,11,4864,2349,294,83508,1439,3869,1208,38052,68,503,710,978,326,6,1334,5019,47753,1880,3869,28130,46798,38315,3846,7364,2192,13,423,6,1138,1553,11,12108,14707,46798,1018,11,4864,757,93569,48908,13,4366,3625,2126,1821,6926,11,4864,757,93569,824,3913,13,14465,94297,45575,757,82653,12329,11,4170,52424,1880,523,34858,1208,5636,6316,768,409,4186,13109,13,1252,294,39982,86581,479,11,514,74206,52962,1133,22011,1744,29449,99253,3913,1826,66090,294,6,316,4091,13,1611,4538,69241,404,1208,18579,9952,7591,416,978,6225,11,9952,281,556,10479,24918,1880,2458,1604,1672,788,1873,13,44564,39361,1880,3625,21901,82,409,4809,11,829,1867,451,11,653,4382,88089,13,11876,294,41901,81,14014,409,15265,88026,15132,4017,5512,13,650,52262,52962,1133,11,513,42182,23761,10737,978,13,29179,321,6496,1208,8305,1130,934,35329,9189,47090,11142,261,5019,841,6502,1218,11252,15265,64032,1466,77,13109,13,36684,67,986,11,9622,46138,11,9189,326,6,4202,1339,13550,285,13,622,6,434,61055,294,6,30992,72684,4068,3625,3625,21901,82,409,4809,2267,1220,11,3846,9859,17317,74533,58271,75804,88253,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,10737,978,11,272,17771,52962,1133,11,8065,1879,68,2933,409,4538,50026,40280,13,19421,1208,3488,513,17477,409,47929,4502,29449,23008,52827,11,35737,274,6,20311,8065,2609,1133,1744,17317,74533,665,5542,409,737,20672,13,43987,26178,11,4502,9189,77438,55745,1744,26317,60404,1826,3869,28130,7364,1208,6140,294,53149,9484,265,1880,409,9517,66,2058,951,282,391,645,11,29557,668,89,1474,6870,20662,4382,3488,13,9589,54312,934,54386,1826,3625,21901,82,409,4809,6033,653,80181,263,949,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,40,690,15806,279,36815,4184,311,279,3984,15696,382,9,9,59742,84,300,13071,96618,358,1053,4478,279,8982,596,24613,300,13071,439,3146,19,14,20,334,13,578,19114,5829,43120,41545,11,31768,1105,320,68,13,70,2637,330,273,80181,263,4063,323,24291,552,320,68,13,70,2637,27393,12966,311,9581,20566,8,311,20599,872,1984,13750,13,2435,1101,1005,54515,3573,4355,63683,1744,4864,91507,9189,55056,261,909,323,87068,4860,3573,14101,54312,934,54386,1826,3625,21901,82,409,4809,6033,653,80181,263,30,909,311,16988,279,10877,13,4452,11,279,8982,596,66343,2410,1436,387,24872,555,8405,810,14509,10507,323,6029,311,1862,872,8349,382,9,70766,71070,315,33811,96618,358,1053,4478,279,19114,596,33811,439,3146,18,14,20,334,13,6104,814,3493,1063,20406,13537,1990,872,6848,320,68,13,70,2637,330,1844,294,39982,86581,479,11,514,74206,52
