{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T21:01:19.455424777Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as follows:\n\n**Persuasive power: 3/5**\n\nThe speaker effectively presents their argument by using simple language, providing examples, and highlighting the importance of addressing the issue. They also show enthusiasm for their work and are passionate about finding a solution. However, there are some areas where they could improve to make their message more convincing:\n\n1. **Lack of concrete data**: The speaker does not provide specific statistics or research findings to support their claims, which makes it difficult to fully understand the scope of the issue.\n2. **Overemphasis on personal experience**: While sharing personal experiences can be engaging, it may detract from the overall persuasiveness of the message if it becomes too focused on individual anecdotes rather than presenting a comprehensive view of the problem and potential solutions.\n3. **Some unclear or technical terms**: The speaker uses some specialized vocabulary (e.g., \"Post-Dap,\" \"hyrête,\" \"churégicale\") that may be unfamiliar to non-experts, which could make it harder for listeners to follow their argument.\n\nOverall, while the speaker's enthusiasm and passion are contagious, they could strengthen their message by incorporating more concrete data and simplifying technical terms.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,4864,91507,9189,89504,7010,514,80259,409,77323,7930,3613,68495,26725,3625,53542,7010,20662,71632,13,445,39982,1100,531,22761,648,7505,258,409,1208,3962,12,1956,13,356,17771,6316,15756,467,7505,258,7930,15119,1557,3625,53542,3869,31632,294,22827,3738,308,425,11,503,34155,22011,26725,3625,53542,13,15089,4788,13,423,5512,337,978,3625,342,1590,13,1952,92215,436,395,7889,3846,7930,15132,2961,49530,5512,8065,1647,15756,467,7505,258,13,7695,47090,47929,1744,7505,258,76605,13510,6316,15538,13,1952,513,71451,514,80259,11,4864,9189,3327,2428,13,5034,3962,12,1956,1826,665,6141,3357,409,1208,12366,12279,10610,10515,1604,20459,3395,258,13,46408,1826,30517,8047,1370,326,6,8671,81,37093,7930,1826,5293,266,3869,326,31769,85,2328,409,326,6,8671,1269,1880,3930,47116,13,1952,11412,13510,1744,1208,3962,12,1956,1826,6316,3273,556,1880,326,6,8671,81,37093,11,6316,7251,648,7930,1826,1208,30517,8047,5309,292,1604,13,7695,47090,47929,28463,1744,514,8286,409,1208,3962,12,1956,19861,12826,7138,75,1001,9952,326,6,9011,713,13,19421,27750,9637,2249,1474,5048,811,409,326,6,8671,81,37093,82133,83786,25108,1215,6316,75332,684,409,326,6,8671,81,37093,13,24703,7930,11412,98054,326,31769,85,2328,951,4433,1572,25945,61907,3742,4160,556,12266,13,2009,80259,513,71451,39015,1180,77776,13,19421,272,17771,1208,73173,5019,1208,88265,76076,48577,29005,70,14014,3381,951,33013,31539,294,39982,80401,9517,79,10515,14014,8065,311,278,66522,13,356,17771,514,80259,11,3900,1826,70374,653,89714,13,356,17771,1208,9517,1335,409,1208,3962,12,1956,13,356,17771,6316,523,324,19395,292,1604,29557,7010,514,39973,1880,16968,3846,7930,13550,547,514,83229,451,13,4418,66,11,3900,2389,404,2727,1208,7251,648,13,3298,77776,11,514,80259,12717,409,20662,89714,11,272,17771,514,10449,5019,829,455,978,7853,324,13,3341,514,11939,1826,1370,86633,12611,978,409,2800,261,3869,326,39982,9769,79,2223,42844,951,49301,13,432,5512,318,1133,3869,27076,677,645,11,951,9622,288,3869,91878,23008,9211,665,17459,261,6316,48659,15105,7930,1826,29557,30532,294,31109,4046,84184,64,343,648,6033,68061,625,1133,665,45889,4520,13,356,17771,78422,532,13,4366,1615,978,17187,11,17317,14848,7591,21200,978,294,49963,12329,20662,15105,39015,5019,38682,1565,12155,52088,66474,409,68061,625,1133,13,3959,54021,409,68226,23761,4046,12821,454,978,11,1880,7930,40321,1339,409,48021,653,4046,451,324,38682,3675,1880,294,6,485,592,462,6853,13,3298,77776,11,5019,514,84233,69,560,1880,1208,9313,3930,11939,11,3900,1826,64284,409,20028,951,7177,27389,3395,10610,648,1765,653,2854,263,6033,1765,19973,402,265,33670,409,45347,3869,326,31769,376,14014,8437,467,13,5034,6425,1744,4864,30714,1180,77776,11,7010,1647,42775,409,38317,1880,1744,4864,52895,375,11,272,17771,409,1491,19010,12329,11,665,50026,40280,463,10079,2428,1880,33670,653,50026,40280,326,6,56178,404,63497,17194,3284,1370,26633,1491,85798,4684,42625,17724,13,2998,3941,409,64441,11,9189,23933,10333,39015,11,40321,978,11,294,6,8629,288,665,54025,11,272,17771,6316,9155,329,265,34501,64829,13,12103,3941,294,83508,959,2727,29557,409,20028,11083,6954,4918,7177,44351,409,5363,261,326,6,454,621,34501,40280,1880,294,6,19680,12329,3625,47728,13,2998,3941,409,326,6,1844,372,78129,11,7930,1826,665,3941,409,58673,15610,1765,653,6141,3357,324,11,4538,3941,294,83508,959,2727,29557,409,20028,951,47590,951,4865,409,1296,288,1744,503,34155,6502,84788,72,3869,3611,12267,1765,326,22827,3941,409,64441,13,7695,47090,47929,1744,16968,513,42775,273,11,29253,6316,25945,51651,390,46302,409,326,62595,354,316,648,11,6316,7643,25108,376,1082,951,12823,409,43656,1880,409,19576,13,89457,11,11083,26633,1491,85798,82133,296,41901,29557,10367,409,1062,1814,1208,10474,27389,978,47681,2428,409,4538,43453,58551,333,35030,950,1880,44351,71751,10253,6978,6316,4186,8082,7706,1604,1880,97717,13,4418,66,11,272,17771,6316,94721,85424,665,6900,409,326,39982,1100,531,22761,648,7505,625,409,1208,3962,9607,391,13,622,34155,6502,665,2848,6729,13,622,34155,6502,35597,1913,72,13,2998,20272,11,503,34155,11083,311,3742,665,17317,665,282,1607,3930,3450,1992,11,5019,1744,9189,9189,26483,19610,14707,293,1188,35657,11,272,17771,43453,3930,5945,98808,409,259,98279,1395,653,53185,9400,2428,13,19421,8065,1620,11,16968,308,31769,1678,6502,3869,6316,3488,294,6,454,981,329,519,1208,17536,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,3
