{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T21:12:31.492789095Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would give a score of 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using relatable examples and analogies to explain complex concepts. They also use rhetorical questions to engage the audience and encourage them to reflect on their own lives. The speaker's reasoning is rigorous, as they provide concrete examples and explanations to support their claims. However, there are moments where the language becomes slightly vague or general, which might make it harder for some listeners to fully grasp the ideas being presented.\n\nOverall, I think the speaker does a great job of presenting their thoughts in a clear and engaging manner, making it easy for the audience to follow along and understand their message.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,3665,89,11,3625,48577,7930,14848,1208,8811,329,648,294,6,2149,42360,11,27549,308,6,1138,535,5636,3869,14707,274,6,15226,261,13,46408,513,41518,7010,28130,83187,3073,685,13,34447,17317,11,4068,1826,54312,934,54386,18728,1339,5019,513,38831,15170,7010,29449,3073,685,665,20272,949,356,17771,19227,1001,7138,75,934,54386,841,513,84295,49606,79507,13,1952,1860,648,1744,7010,3625,35603,409,29449,3073,685,11,15878,21965,513,1153,261,409,4860,13,7777,11,1370,51173,11,70374,33670,409,96586,49733,11,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,66517,1339,47838,14896,13,42215,308,26248,55455,3869,46131,9952,3846,7930,513,1522,275,49733,13,19421,42676,389,961,275,3869,294,6,3457,11,389,6348,64,26725,67807,84,84595,79071,14896,294,49455,265,7010,29449,17536,13,1611,1208,27584,85722,1744,29449,34922,11,3846,7591,2050,7010,653,1560,1330,64441,11,40321,978,409,39381,409,293,64272,3904,409,71632,7010,514,43014,3900,25692,48908,1880,19443,404,13,44564,2389,5397,11,3846,7591,2050,294,22827,1560,1330,10723,40321,978,409,924,75004,409,23423,8047,11,409,719,11,294,6,9035,13109,11,294,6,90446,7010,514,43014,27549,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,409,3460,288,6179,5512,96642,2018,3159,5512,7930,513,14425,79738,1880,7930,513,67807,84,81541,3869,30517,514,27138,13,356,17771,2018,3159,978,7010,1208,88265,29449,1560,40807,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,272,17771,2018,3159,978,1744,326,54386,2322,665,18579,1880,1744,514,1323,716,519,5636,62197,13,4366,86633,11,48488,5636,62197,11,42676,389,38831,83384,653,52827,934,54386,308,26248,6502,33614,41199,951,65838,11,1370,51173,11,272,17771,3846,1765,1744,653,51655,409,42775,13,622,6,26577,648,409,60946,265,4068,389,20272,5019,18434,265,951,17536,7010,514,76354,44351,12569,261,1880,1218,1864,301,978,7010,514,27138,13,12535,389,20272,5019,18434,265,51854,98385,17536,32118,5317,14014,7010,6316,27584,17536,665,79071,80444,949,622,34155,16968,22011,26725,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,21063,11,409,32118,97495,11,57459,665,51655,7010,1208,59471,409,15907,2018,3159,5512,11,409,15907,98385,17536,13,27058,3846,20028,11,4864,14843,285,653,4046,331,63497,3869,9517,1072,635,1208,88452,409,29449,17536,3869,30517,951,70175,57146,1744,4864,390,708,285,13,34447,13324,28068,306,653,5636,10878,4864,834,58139,519,46777,51655,91678,519,6316,2018,3159,978,13,65381,31632,409,326,22827,11,4864,14951,1130,951,1719,75104,5019,85114,4502,388,3625,70175,1880,4864,84921,1208,23878,13109,951,13324,409,274,6,20311,10253,2609,3808,409,70175,11,409,3846,98395,11,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,11,409,513,22040,1430,7010,514,18111,324,1880,409,28130,21063,3930,27138,13,80905,39043,5019,60946,265,4068,64972,45712,261,48901,951,32118,4919,2191,288,409,29449,272,5976,2933,11,1744,3846,45441,5019,64972,342,52424,1208,6485,13109,14425,24918,409,12155,17536,5019,59148,13206,6316,1218,2827,43711,9379,344,13109,6033,5019,64972,60946,265,76076,52088,66474,665,27138,13,1952,25692,25945,14707,18434,265,1880,9465,59976,265,84871,84871,409,79165,15878,60019,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,13,24703,308,17771,6502,100243,13,19421,9465,17317,11,272,17771,42676,27584,79380,57625,42676,389,379,1208,9517,1517,978,331,275,13,11842,13,1611,29449,81337,11,4502,389,264,951,9234,69898,409,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,13,27058,1081,20099,3869,18434,265,11,389,44521,1339,56316,59062,978,1880,389,841,35737,6502,39015,13,4366,346,1744,272,17771,42676,27584,40970,11,389,42182,513,4865,3913,1208,83067,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,653,57677,6672,13,64105,64,11412,13510,11,4502,389,17782,3869,20028,11,16968,3846,934,54386,17782,3869,20028,13,15089,60946,265,4068,389,20272,13,34447,13085,89,3846,934,54386,92215,20028,13,12095,389,60946,64972,11,16968,3846,7930,513,39904,39015,2902,2784,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,3041,264,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,1375,15436,10507,323,24291,552,311,10552,6485,19476,13,2435,1101,1005,87068,4860,311,16988,279,10877,323,15253,1124,311,8881,389,872,1866,6439,13,578,19114,596,33811,374,47999,11,439,814,3493,14509,10507,323,41941,311,1862,872,8349,13,4452,11,1070,527,14269,1405,279,4221,9221,10284,40146,477,4689,11,902,2643,1304,433,16127,369,1063,24475,311,7373,34477,279,6848,1694,10666,627,198,28589,11,358,1781,279,19114,1587,264,2294,2683,315,32644,872,11555,304,264,2867,323,23387,11827,11,3339,433,4228,369,279,10877,311
