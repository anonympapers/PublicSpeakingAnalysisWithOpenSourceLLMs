They also provide specific details about the types of data being analyzed and the potential benefits of their approach. The speaker's enthusiasm and passion for their work are evident throughout the transcript, which can be infectious and persuasive.\n\nThe reasoning presented is not overly complex or rigorous, but it is sufficient to make their points and illustrate their ideas. The speaker does a good job of breaking down complex concepts into more manageable pieces, making it easier for the audience to understand and follow along.\n\nOverall, while there may be some minor flaws in the speech, such as occasional lapses into technical jargon or slightly awkward phrasing, the speaker's overall message is clear, engaging, and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,1208,2869,38469,51307,2428,17317,29557,294,93825,26725,951,1160,78,3946,1880,951,27389,35573,3625,37923,13,4829,467,11,1208,2869,38469,51307,2428,2773,295,969,409,20028,100198,1880,3869,34923,285,51625,1854,934,80720,264,41869,25843,5019,16456,3458,66014,326,6,28400,414,8065,8924,326,6,3989,33670,514,25911,13,64105,64,11,503,34155,55162,10036,513,89504,5636,62197,13,423,6,370,541,11,39043,28068,68,5636,62197,13,423,6,370,541,11,3625,274,1133,9189,89504,409,1208,77463,11245,354,2428,13,5034,63828,5717,6853,264,28154,268,11,389,25692,14240,664,1291,326,6,90446,294,22827,1860,290,13,4702,68,42138,11,4538,520,466,43711,39361,11,10071,6502,79380,100198,5019,27389,35573,13,12095,4538,463,8995,4499,11,2126,519,653,10025,593,6033,6502,13,622,34155,55162,10036,513,3327,72684,64972,13,1252,1860,290,294,6,19010,19388,11,28490,951,5636,35881,318,458,2107,668,324,7930,264,32347,265,48488,294,6,41540,811,1765,26725,3625,40321,1821,11,1765,26725,27750,40321,1821,13,27058,9189,71751,6316,887,8047,11,42138,71686,6316,77818,294,31769,588,4618,11,389,294,1601,64,951,5636,294,31769,5717,2606,81560,294,6,10610,9034,417,3869,23702,261,13,356,17771,653,5363,274,31769,783,1215,13,1952,40142,326,98279,4099,294,6,20243,2058,8065,20272,6316,4046,20609,68,44615,8942,4558,593,11,84871,409,15471,417,3869,78551,1880,3869,8678,805,13,46706,27750,2606,81560,294,31769,5717,77,5512,11,389,23008,325,514,38900,951,274,85798,7930,18757,79738,23761,9559,5512,3869,951,52962,3808,3869,7617,12249,13,4366,51173,11,653,3091,8783,21430,1481,27620,593,11,951,2798,14081,2859,11,6033,951,3577,919,7930,841,3381,60946,265,934,22827,951,40321,1821,1826,665,8137,13,5034,38317,951,52962,3808,3869,7617,12249,1826,7010,20662,36897,10484,13109,409,2536,5392,5512,11,308,17771,6502,1180,77776,6502,3284,13,7671,519,934,80720,1860,290,11,389,1826,42182,9517,4581,404,653,43453,13,34447,6502,951,7363,8467,4647,331,31539,586,82,13,356,17771,326,6,1132,68,74672,5048,12,651,1188,13,1252,951,1665,22589,951,5634,5512,11,1826,951,92980,6033,417,951,12823,409,49586,76608,13,27058,3625,20028,11,503,34155,296,6,1354,23772,653,5089,294,31109,887,8047,13,9170,1880,31914,580,11,653,1963,13,1952,1826,26725,3869,326,31769,56745,13,1952,264,42587,978,653,1963,5019,88817,9211,100198,3625,44827,11,15878,98004,2439,11,951,78551,11,326,6,283,19456,425,1218,1291,13,6178,72,11,503,49963,1082,3625,123299,9004,7546,288,13,622,34155,9517,47348,1208,10484,13109,951,46681,22209,14014,5019,46524,100198,3625,44827,7930,17317,92759,306,13,622,34155,59062,978,39587,5019,20245,35573,951,12823,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,11,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,312,5741,11,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,514,83597,7033,978,8637,2428,11,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,75831,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,514,83597,7033,978,8637,2428,11,28391,1474,6870,11,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,18027,261,951,46681,951,46681,951,46681,18757,1056,5512,13,356,17771,1208,887,8047,13,25145,72,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,4382,323,1375,15436,10507,11,1778,439,27393,279,3392,315,828,14890,311,264,11191,6875,13,2435,1101,3493,3230,3649,922,279,4595,315,828,1694,30239,323,279,4754,7720,315,872,5603,13,578,19114,596,36232,323,11939,369,872,990,527,30576,6957,279,36815,11,902,649,387,50600,323,66343,627,198,791,33811,10666,374,539,39532,6485,477,47999,11,719,433,374,14343,311,1304,872,3585,323,41468,872,6848,13,578,19114,1587,264,1695,2683,315,15061,1523,6485,19476,1139,810,71128,9863,11,3339,433,8831,369,279,10877,311,3619,323,1833,3235,627,198,28589,11,1418,1070,1253,387,1063,9099,41859,304,279,8982,11,1778,439,28961,51055,288,1139,11156,503,71921,477,10284,29859,1343,97578,11,279,19114,596,8244,1984,374,2867,11,23387,11,323,66343,13,128009],"total_duration":7150003007,"load_duration":209846,"prompt_eval_count":749,"prompt_eval_duration":1510407000,"eval_count":186,"eval_duration":5638769000}
