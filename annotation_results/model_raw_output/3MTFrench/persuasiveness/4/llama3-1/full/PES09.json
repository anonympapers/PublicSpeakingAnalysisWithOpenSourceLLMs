For example, the use of colloquial expressions (\"ropey-basque\", \"vacaces\") might not be suitable for all audiences. Nevertheless, the overall message and reasoning presented are convincing and persuasive, making it a strong 4 out of 5.\n\nDimension: Persuasive power of the speech\n\nTask: Evaluate the transcript based on this dimension and provide a score between 1 and 5 using the provided scale.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,11,4864,36731,350,5512,277,1880,45602,11412,25692,85815,9189,1765,59976,265,11,4864,35456,82,1370,86633,951,9467,3095,13,34447,27584,665,9467,3095,11,4864,3136,3869,23423,261,3869,7643,270,4558,325,13,350,21198,11,326,6,39883,62891,11,272,17771,3930,34520,88,1481,300,593,13,11583,3197,1557,1765,32592,514,46496,11,4864,326,41901,73,2194,259,14671,55398,81991,1208,86451,13,14465,757,86345,83457,7010,3625,29465,273,12249,5019,6316,19266,26540,409,20884,96308,3167,566,8047,13,5186,12416,3625,75652,11,514,9517,444,4057,11,4864,961,425,653,2807,265,9952,11083,83491,53819,409,33415,13,356,17771,42138,55140,2922,6496,11,1647,70927,409,270,4558,325,296,17771,19443,84,56321,37291,3869,326,77025,40807,13,2009,7364,519,1880,15907,94444,729,5979,1370,3625,17231,294,6,1334,11,1208,296,46651,951,9467,1157,7930,7591,79833,306,11,951,17231,294,6,1334,83786,25108,77,5512,7010,1647,2807,265,665,757,8854,13,65381,46777,37291,11,653,27584,1343,98078,48099,11,326,6,24677,8511,296,41901,294,6,1334,13,1708,1105,11,934,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,949,445,93847,665,54409,7986,86100,6563,7889,951,17231,294,6,1334,8065,53052,294,31109,10353,409,45980,3159,978,13,3489,438,514,622,978,8326,1380,79,12339,15907,1208,7479,409,1647,2807,265,294,93847,11,42676,1208,9467,325,2098,12267,3625,41255,951,3273,8696,294,6,1334,11,6033,42676,3625,7364,65,919,3869,1208,7479,409,326,93847,11,503,34155,38605,14687,1370,1208,8877,16501,685,3930,435,3159,11,665,5542,409,259,6,88423,1744,951,7173,645,13,1708,1105,11,9189,9189,7631,10333,15878,294,2182,87320,54163,11,326,6,88988,7930,17452,7643,270,4558,325,11,274,55624,978,22550,3869,3846,1343,98078,48099,13,80905,71357,11,66021,934,54386,514,38831,83384,3869,6800,951,523,2053,1765,27750,49276,47194,11,1744,3846,45441,514,7591,4550,479,294,31109,671,67,90486,6033,409,31837,653,81690,11,514,7591,809,40280,294,31109,40146,1765,6316,21945,668,1760,19395,519,6316,2960,46140,11,43905,27750,15082,2322,73468,665,51655,951,282,2353,11,951,32118,5317,288,69125,656,1880,294,6,1334,11,7930,326,17771,3062,409,71925,1992,11,5019,951,4860,409,77463,11,1744,409,7970,34501,40280,409,26317,6033,19456,87455,13,2009,719,409,1647,42775,409,270,4558,325,1826,409,4848,14929,2641,15907,4046,23045,91555,1765,6141,3357,1759,13,27058,45602,11,4864,66517,76190,3869,6316,98652,1661,78129,54008,20712,13,5034,98652,9440,39,5019,11113,11,19320,6409,67,80011,13,4366,326,54386,1206,12267,11,17055,67,11694,2428,951,54008,1056,5512,13,356,17771,44093,6502,13,2998,20272,11,9189,1208,4635,2852,53070,653,28800,15878,514,47929,20662,98652,13,41621,9189,7477,375,41881,7010,514,1369,625,12844,951,1556,437,11,87158,95626,372,10390,1395,1880,513,20272,2995,75,29051,7010,3625,326,4798,409,1208,369,4978,325,3930,38900,1826,3502,13,19421,14707,20662,938,1557,665,37608,11,7930,264,1062,1339,25024,514,62891,2700,12844,409,326,62595,354,1880,76773,1339,9952,1208,98652,9440,39,13,19421,6824,68,3869,46131,514,31405,7010,514,4632,1208,326,525,11,5019,40970,653,296,19010,853,294,93847,1880,294,6,1334,11,22299,84871,409,86696,27378,409,98385,20934,645,11,7930,513,7591,2050,1880,958,351,79738,951,6316,9952,3625,46106,13,1708,1105,11,2847,288,7010,326,6,23919,11,389,326,49963,1082,5019,98054,68292,1260,2145,77776,951,4046,23045,91555,25945,7591,630,5512,13,3206,30532,951,17764,3545,75460,11,2322,61512,3869,8811,11,326,77025,447,535,3930,89023,3714,11,6033,653,4046,20609,68,72155,43643,425,519,1208,39973,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,514,1515,78493,409,19576,1744,4864,52895,375,35737,30219,978,3869,18027,261,951,4865,67965,2053,13,7695,1826,39587,3062,294,49152,13603,6316,91678,367,33204,51453,409,1208,59157,13109,13,34447,4068,77680,3125,1208,60128,11,1208,12437,409,11083,47590,30,27058,45602,11,4864,94297,20028,917,8023,1208,65285,266,7033,978,8637,2428,7010,951,4865,69406,11,22299,1208,1323,546,8047,294,31109,7173,273,11,6033,951,1367,28154,2436,665,9511,67763,5019,951,2107,4893,69125,11,22299,514,7591,809,1001,294,31109,40146,13,1708,1105,42844,26317,463,8995,288,9467,3095,11,665,39002,409,4809,11,6033,15265,463,8995,72,4558,665,8628,978,1764,11,77558,653,4632,65396,11,9189,73953,89,45325,11,25692,85815,3869,41091,13,19421,3869,11083,5636,1824,12242,11,14707,1131,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,3984,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,320,7092,25,220,16
