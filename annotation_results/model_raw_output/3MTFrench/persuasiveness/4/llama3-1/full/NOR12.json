Nevertheless, the speaker's passion, expertise, and clear communication skills make their message compelling and convincing.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,9964,22011,3625,912,7911,2249,5019,60946,265,3625,4046,998,3742,13,1952,96839,11,272,17771,326,6,561,22761,1065,2428,11148,566,978,12267,13,445,6,561,22761,1065,2428,11,272,17771,326,57286,799,951,3197,4558,2392,11,951,4046,998,3742,11,951,66017,13,445,57286,799,409,326,52152,5589,72,1474,647,35534,13,362,326,52152,4550,11,1208,64441,11148,566,978,12267,11,272,17771,326,57286,799,951,912,7911,2249,951,19670,288,7930,40321,306,16968,3846,7930,17317,1218,80284,13,4418,66,326,57286,799,409,326,52152,5589,72,1474,519,46110,13,2998,75249,326,57286,799,409,27750,912,7911,2249,11412,68226,17317,29557,10367,409,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,3625,4046,998,3742,949,34447,20662,3488,308,17771,6502,9517,1189,11,44829,447,80720,264,24560,1153,8047,3900,379,264,220,1041,8261,1370,653,4571,3457,268,1880,48078,7424,81,1149,8047,11,20263,9483,14081,258,13,2998,67781,11,3900,379,264,220,1041,8261,11,389,841,11427,1339,6502,4068,1208,523,61047,1880,1208,41263,20712,3930,13612,321,43989,54206,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,389,829,275,1744,272,17771,77433,3869,1208,18475,409,220,19,912,7911,2249,294,6,67229,70,48099,665,653,912,88,2933,951,16333,316,13,33150,45369,409,20662,18475,11,389,308,26248,6502,6316,9517,1335,11148,566,978,12267,11,6316,48901,409,28130,58617,1826,5276,8047,665,4046,64374,13,356,17771,1208,84850,4558,21152,1376,1130,11,84440,1880,342,1604,1026,272,17771,26633,13,12095,326,31769,64374,1826,57459,8065,45369,409,20662,9517,1335,11,389,43989,45889,28800,96642,11,1208,523,61047,3930,13612,321,841,87264,6502,1208,27584,13,7695,841,18728,1339,25692,85815,5636,282,1607,6033,5636,70412,13,7695,308,59858,44521,1339,25692,85815,6502,409,17536,1765,88026,11,41091,4864,841,1446,2852,6502,39015,5019,9189,665,89504,1880,9189,841,841,779,9188,89,6502,39015,5019,296,6,20243,2743,13,1708,1105,11,4502,14240,664,1291,3625,436,9011,14295,15132,11148,566,978,17724,11,17317,264,14175,285,409,60946,265,514,13612,321,11,665,20272,11,3900,665,11412,409,27584,5019,40744,3625,4046,998,3742,13,6178,72,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,55624,978,676,2852,3869,26633,4046,998,3742,7930,958,351,79738,665,2024,3833,273,13,39783,4046,998,458,7930,594,16167,3869,29449,13612,321,1880,6316,47838,4046,998,458,7930,308,26248,6502,6316,4046,998,458,3869,29449,63401,13,1708,1105,11,6316,4046,998,458,3869,29449,665,20272,11,272,17771,3846,7930,66167,42138,6316,39887,869,6043,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1208,10237,4738,5048,294,31109,4046,998,458,13,1952,11412,513,38831,15170,9952,6316,4046,998,458,409,38920,62827,13,393,9425,593,39043,62827,11,3900,308,17771,6502,48488,5636,25626,1744,73103,409,1208,88100,12366,26584,11,10071,7930,264,6316,58617,25945,36897,13,64105,64,296,26248,79380,1043,35285,554,3869,73103,409,29449,13612,321,13,11876,912,7911,2249,409,326,49455,265,4046,998,458,7930,594,16167,3869,29449,13612,321,82133,45575,23761,1651,404,5512,1370,20662,4046,998,458,3869,29449,389,13,16233,12454,360,978,90053,294,80720,11,44829,653,4545,3869,5457,294,6,40031,2987,11,1208,3577,290,11412,49806,261,1880,513,1208,11412,7591,566,268,9211,6316,25176,13,33150,45369,409,20662,25176,11,3900,11412,379,39929,4046,2796,409,13558,263,1630,11,934,54386,11412,68226,76826,85877,440,261,1765,10335,265,3869,326,26248,579,409,20662,33013,635,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,3625,3383,39965,1771,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,11,272,96287,653,28800,304,47391,978,66021,934,85217,84764,1188,951,47710,16948,919,1880,46152,97958,24613,329,5512,409,85877,440,261,6316,25176,11148,566,978,12267,1370,9880,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,46152,15132,436,395,324,5512,77433,10253,12025,22761,1065,3457,729,1880,17317,28463,13,62463,123299,9004,12025,22761,1065,3457,729,84440,82133,23008,9211,3869,14843,556,27750,56506,11,10071,76680,269,81235,11,1765,6141,3357,324,3869,326,26248,579,409,1376,2482,7033,978,8637,8467,13,34447,5019,45602,11,46152,82133,39929,63669,409,60946,265,40744,3625,9517,4109,11148,566,978,17724,7930,44521,546,15925,8065,45369,409,20662,25176,13,6178,72,11,7010,7643,83067,11,4864,757,36731,83195,6316,409,27750,9517,4109,13,27058,45602,11,4864,91507,1046,19010,52424,951,912,7911,2249,1744,4864,91507,6233,42219,1765,294,81979,912,7911,2249,13,81245,82133,958,351,404,9465,84440,1880,3869,326,26248,579,409,85114,97262,8839,409,84921,11,4864,91507,22842,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,8065,4545,409,1208,19277,13,3206,42775,11412,76826,1615,1601,3869,14843,556,8065,64972,1880,60946,265,64972,3625,96642,9517,4109,7930,14848,15925,8065,4545,409,20662,19277,13,14465,91507,68226,76826,1380,4150,10367,27750,44827,10253,12025,22761,1065,3457,729,1880,58673,15610,9952,84440,74699,3869,1913,409,14843,556,3625,24654,12025,22761,1065,8467,13,1219,2727,75249,11,409,326,52152,5589,3904,6800,3869,326,52152,5589,3904,46110,11,3900,308,59858,264,934,22827,6502,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,12
