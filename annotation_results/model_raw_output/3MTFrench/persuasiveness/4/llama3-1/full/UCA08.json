The tone is somewhat ambiguous, making it difficult to pinpoint the speaker's stance on the issue. This lack of clarity might lead some listeners to question the speaker's credibility.\n\nHowever, as the speech progresses, the speaker shares specific stories and anecdotes that seem to support their argument. These personal accounts can be quite powerful in engaging the audience and creating emotional connections. The use of rhetorical questions (\"Pour m'importe j'ai adsent earning...\") also adds a touch of authenticity and humility.\n\nNevertheless, I deduct points for several reasons:\n\n1. **Lack of logical structure**: The speech jumps between different ideas and themes without a clear thread connecting them.\n2. **Overuse of repetition**: The repeated phrases (\"Les techniques de la main d'ici des...\") become monotonous and may lose the audience's attention.\n3. **Unclear message**: Despite some compelling personal stories, the overall message remains somewhat vague.\n\nIn conclusion, while the speech has some engaging moments, its persuasive power is hampered by a lack of logical structure, overuse of repetition, and an unclear message. Therefore, I assign a score of 3 out of 5.\n\nPlease note that this evaluation is subjective and based on my interpretation of the transcript.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,445,6496,11,3846,342,647,301,39043,53926,3113,409,1208,84117,48448,13,2998,37622,1744,1156,337,351,2727,11,7020,1744,42676,27584,326,54386,59157,1286,1826,3930,114103,103199,11,3577,2439,665,653,38983,11,10071,3900,101368,1794,51998,13,7695,25692,102864,23761,1794,19700,2249,13,7695,264,7930,11898,1826,356,17771,653,28800,5636,62197,1744,3625,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,9395,5512,11,389,3567,969,665,39929,6316,47838,54574,731,11,6316,47838,87810,13,11876,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,1880,62822,593,17317,5534,7404,89,514,1880,326,31109,259,26248,20272,409,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,1826,69003,978,8065,326,49455,265,7930,514,30806,841,961,665,2697,68905,11,3846,8547,409,1208,921,511,20243,87264,8065,21901,409,98054,14240,266,26584,42676,389,1826,17302,978,7010,514,12018,73,425,3930,220,508,267,18205,9952,514,2458,1880,19421,3900,379,264,653,20272,294,31109,18579,409,1208,42960,7907,13,27058,296,6,94896,503,34155,14058,306,28744,11,503,34155,77635,3869,453,3095,5019,20028,38525,12,68146,8047,272,1291,5924,11,6033,14741,8065,6044,84,26092,68,33670,1880,294,49455,265,7010,514,21901,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,36815,4999,198,6153,15884,5403,1555,279,1495,11,358,690,4879,311,15806,1202,24613,300,13071,382,9,9,59742,84,300,13071,18607,68063,220,18,320,2729,315,220,20,340,198,8586,596,856,33811,512,198,791,19114,8638,555,33018,459,4623,922,330,4355,84117,48448,1,323,1268,433,36716,311,872,4443,3217,13,578,16630,374,14738,55861,11,3339,433,5107,311,67638,279,19114,596,30031,389,279,4360,13,1115,6996,315,32373,2643,3063,1063,24475,311,3488,279,19114,596,38769,627,198,11458,11,439,279,8982,68711,11,279,19114,13551,3230,7493,323,94066,430,2873,311,1862,872,5811,13,4314,4443,9815,649,387,5115,8147,304,23387,279,10877,323,6968,14604,13537,13,578,1005,315,87068,4860,3573,43278,296,6,94896,503,34155,14058,306,28744,1131,909,1101,11621,264,5916,315,54348,323,75372,627,198,70788,11,358,37910,3585,369,3892,8125,512,198,16,13,3146,43,474,315,20406,6070,96618,578,8982,35308,1990,2204,6848,323,22100,2085,264,2867,4617,21583,1124,13,198,17,13,3146,1959,817,315,54515,96618,578,11763,32847,3573,24641,12823,409,1208,1925,294,6,3457,951,1131,909,3719,1647,26934,788,323,1253,9229,279,10877,596,6666,13,198,18,13,3146,64818,1576,1984,96618,18185
