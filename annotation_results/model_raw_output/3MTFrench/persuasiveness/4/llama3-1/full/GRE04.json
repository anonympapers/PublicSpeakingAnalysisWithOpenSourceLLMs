{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-26T21:02:23.032110076Z","response":"Based on the transcript, I would rate the persuasiveness of the speech as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively crafts a convincing message by using a narrative structure that draws the audience in. They start by describing their personal experience and connection to music, which creates an emotional link with the listener. The speaker then skillfully weaves together their experiences as a surgeon and musician, highlighting the parallels between the two disciplines. This approach makes the abstract concepts more relatable and engaging.\n\nThe reasoning is also rigorous, as the speaker uses clear analogies and examples to explain complex ideas. For instance, they compare the process of learning music with that of mastering surgical techniques, demonstrating how both require dedication and practice. The speaker's use of metaphors (\"le solfaits de la chirurgie\") and vivid descriptions (\"une trompette... en train d'un improvis√©\") adds to the persuasiveness by making the message more memorable.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the speech could benefit from more explicit connections between the musical analogies and the main point about creating a \"solfaits\" for surgery. While the analogy is compelling, it takes some time to fully understand its relevance. Nevertheless, the speaker's passion and conviction are evident throughout the performance, making the message overall quite persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,949,356,17771,3869,1208,48659,477,69328,598,13,5034,39973,409,1208,89669,13,5034,39973,3930,34997,13,41621,308,6,57558,10333,949,39783,65636,79,6672,13,46408,1826,665,5542,294,22827,80163,978,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,6316,281,5615,1557,11,6316,47838,81613,13,5034,89669,274,69537,19010,12339,5636,12108,11,5636,83457,11,5636,62321,13,46408,9189,665,60172,11,27549,274,6,3239,337,1339,11,27549,9189,41518,13,46408,54606,818,1765,15907,281,9011,2392,13,5034,65636,79,6672,1826,13034,569,100162,13,2009,270,25253,12717,13,39783,270,25253,7643,25108,376,15760,13,39783,270,25253,13550,978,71,2711,409,1208,89669,13,7695,308,59858,264,6502,409,6367,13,64105,64,86100,934,6,88423,409,326,6,306,969,25108,40280,13,1611,326,6,306,969,25108,40280,1826,1131,29749,259,6,300,2536,949,393,46396,13,14465,757,824,5469,13,14465,841,63762,6502,3930,16968,409,89669,13,14465,42775,273,7010,1208,71546,5673,648,13,350,788,3625,49301,11,4864,100164,951,60120,71546,5673,552,7930,15132,665,5542,653,1208,274,481,479,7930,9517,79,66522,35597,1880,35597,3625,123299,9004,13033,288,11,3625,123299,9004,665,6583,25108,40280,13,81245,14848,20662,39143,11,20662,38317,1880,20662,74772,768,13,1219,2727,951,3167,3457,729,13,3489,438,4864,7591,5924,11,4864,864,77,2852,951,45369,409,2092,3716,1220,11,4864,9189,11357,67763,13,622,53149,79717,1208,35019,339,76,2428,11,3625,9192,2727,11,4864,66517,2852,3930,7591,331,333,48468,13,622,53149,79717,3625,10074,645,13,622,34155,11083,6502,3930,16968,39043,13,34447,7970,11,42138,9964,6800,285,13,19421,9964,60946,82,1744,514,2092,64965,11,272,17771,653,46110,78422,532,5019,3625,3167,3457,729,13,356,17771,3869,28130,917,9484,265,514,16287,44618,13,19421,272,17771,6316,2307,76385,2908,5019,58673,15610,40126,13,2998,71546,5673,648,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,20662,76385,2908,13,24971,409,13612,3716,1220,13,1708,1105,41091,11,503,34155,7591,21200,978,294,31769,68019,514,2092,3716,1220,409,1208,95234,1880,3930,13033,68,71546,5673,648,934,80720,17537,5118,1339,3869,1208,89385,10390,285,1317,8047,3930,18003,278,13,4418,66,39015,11,9189,9189,23933,10333,4068,71546,5673,648,13,74656,16006,978,13,14465,36731,51307,7711,13,14465,42775,273,9952,951,71546,5673,552,11,27467,12558,2734,1133,13,19421,17317,58673,484,2439,1765,951,72886,409,71546,5673,648,9517,301,13,62463,46681,72886,17317,41675,3869,27389,3826,1208,60128,3930,13033,68,71546,5673,648,934,80720,264,326,26248,579,294,22827,15730,5746,635,757,294,53149,8135,1056,425,13,1219,2727,20662,15730,5746,635,4046,1074,12267,11,3900,757,29557,409,75871,265,3869,6316,26633,90272,3488,13,11876,447,2053,409,27750,44827,72886,15132,3625,5636,62623,288,5019,3327,72684,1208,60128,3930,13033,68,71546,5673,648,934,80720,13,622,34155,294,58591,73511,7769,9465,11083,46681,72886,1880,1208,60128,13,2998,51092,11,9952,514,71546,5673,648,11,17317,958,652,978,35511,9400,81235,27750,4398,1880,3846,15132,3625,6954,4918,100246,11,3625,6954,4918,83229,86709,294,22827,43453,2092,3716,1220,409,1208,71546,5673,648,13,33150,1620,11,4502,9189,62299,3167,3457,268,11,9189,62299,17634,81,5512,9024,479,514,2092,3716,1220,5019,514,80410,11,10071,39043,9189,29557,2221,409,64972,100196,13,1611,1208,27584,85722,11,514,71546,5673,3675,4046,6323,404,2473,4538,83187,2092,3716,1220,5019,64972,5916,261,1880,779,78756,4538,11939,13,3341,326,6,434,306,13327,11,665,32118,8332,483,11,513,42182,44093,23761,514,11939,13,2331,220,79223,5941,7092,505,220,16,28,1962,520,682,311,220,20,28,1225,1790,13,2331,76219,24557,5941,644,701,9647,11,1268,66343,374,279,8982,304,420,36815,11,602,1770,2637,656,279,1732,13750,11003,264,40661,1984,30,2209,872,33811,47999,30,2331,66913,5941,83445,36815,315,279,586,5178,2728,304,279,41447,25823,3857,13,2057,3619,1268,15806,433,11,1005,279,4096,315,279,13167,7633,304,279,3857,51959,24557,13,21335,27785,832,1396,439,459,4320,482,420,1396,374,264,5573,323,433,706,311,387,2728,3196,389,279,5569,7633,304,279,79223,3857,25750,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,36815,11,358,1053,4478,279,24613,300,13071,315,279,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,44948,264,40661,1984,555,1701,264,19775,6070,430,27741,279,10877,304,13,2435,1212,555,23524,872,4443,3217,323,3717,311,4731,11,902,11705,459,14604,2723,449,279,11700,13,578,19114,1243,10151,3725,584,4798,3871,872,11704,439,264,46098,323,39844,11,39686,279,72474,1990,279,1403,49255,13,1115,5603,3727,279,8278,19476,810,1375,15436,323,23387,627,198,791,33811,374,1101,47999,11,439,279,19114,5829,2867,24291,552,323,10507,311,10552,6485,6848,13,1789,2937,11,814,9616,279,1920,315,6975,4731,449,430,315,88861,34933,12823,11,45296,1268,2225,1397,39955,323,6725,13,578,19114,596,1005,315,31768,1105,3573,273,2092,3716,1220,409,1208,71546,5673,648,909,323,43120,28887,3573,2957,65636,79,6672,1131,665,5542,294,22827,80163,978,909,11621,311,279,24613,300,13071,555,3339,279,1984,810,33596,627,198,791,1193,2944,358,8434,956,3041,4
