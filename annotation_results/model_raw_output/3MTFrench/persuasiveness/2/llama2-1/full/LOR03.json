Un jour, like usual, she went to see the royal doctor. After doing some tests, the verdict was that a spell had been cast on her breast, cancer. To cure the princess, it is necessary to know exactly what kind of illness she is suffering from. And yes, cancers are like locks, and we need the right key to open them. As a mad scientist, even though I don't have a magic wand, I must fabricate this key. In fact, there are mainly three types of breast cancer. Doctors have successfully treated two of them using the existing key, but the third one has no key that can cure it. Nobody knows why. Of course, we try to help her with the best possible care, so for some patients, we use explosive therapy. But unfortunately, it does more harm than good, and sometimes it doesn't work because some patients develop resistant bacteria. I must fabricate a new key that can lift the curse. To do this, I will use an old recipe from the wise men who cured diabetes. They had first tested it on animals, but it destroyed their insulin-producing cells as well. But before they could completely cure them, they noticed that these animals also had circulatory virtues. I am therefore trying to modify these ancient keys to fit my needs without being toxic. In fact, I create molecules using chemical reactions. And that, I do step by step. First, I build a part of the molecule. To do this, I look at how other chemists have done it, because molecules, even though they are very different, have small common points that allow them to react in the same way. So I apply their protocol to my preparations. Then I create another part using other protocols that I find in the same way. And finally, I assemble the whole thing to get the molecule I'm looking for. But it's not as easy as that, unfortunately. Molecules don't always follow the theory, and that doesn't give me what I want. So sometimes I have to modify the protocols. I also have to purify the molecule so that it's completely pure. And impurities can come from any source and disturb its action on the cancer. Finally, before giving the key to the princess, I must make sure it's in perfect shape. And for that, I make her pass some tests. I also have to check that she can function on my molecule and that it's not toxic, of course. It's not like there's a princess around, you know. If I don't succeed, I have to start all over again, looking for new protocols and new molecules. But if I manage to open the lock, the cancer won't be happy, and it won't produce any offspring. Yes. \n\nData Entry: According to the transcription provided, how persuasive is the speaker's argument in this public performance? Is their reasoning rigorous?
