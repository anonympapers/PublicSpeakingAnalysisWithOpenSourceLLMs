Donc, notre three little pigs, it's well in the brine. When suddenly the mean old man grabbed them and took them away. I'm going to enjoy this moment. It's the perfect time for a treat. Well, Garou won't eat the entirety of the pig. He'll just take the juicy parts, the meat. And let the rest rot. You see, the coproduits represent 20% of the weight of a pig. A pig weighs 100 kg, and with 20 million pigs slaughtered annually in France alone, you do the math. It comes out to 7,000 blue whales. That's a lot of waste, folks. We need to act and find new ways to valorize these by-products to reduce the ecological debt and create value. That's what I'm going to focus on in my text. My goal is to find new paths for valuing the leftovers from pork production, like the lung, the liver, the heart, or even the feathers. For that, I'll be interested in educating molecules that have beneficial effects on human health. Let me explain. Take the example of the feathers. You remember that game with the ghosts and the little man, Pac-Man. And just imagine for a moment that the feathers from the era of the pig are rich in protein and represent the platform of the game. Pac-Man will play the role of the nanny and will come to crunch the proteins of the feathers. Just like that, Gamerver, it's the end of the reaction in psychotherapy. So, at the end of the game, we find ourselves with a multitude of small pieces of protein that Pac-Man has managed to cut. And these small pieces of protein have desirable properties, such as potential and hematic. Therefore, by valorizing these leftovers from pork production, we could potentially prevent diabetes in our ton-ton management and even reduce the attention deficit of my misuse-attze, and yes, ladies and gentlemen. We can't stress enough how valuable these leftovers are. They have the potential to create value and improve health. || Données D'entrée ||At your opinion, what is the degree of persuasion of this speech in this transcription, that is, whether the person is effectively convincing?
