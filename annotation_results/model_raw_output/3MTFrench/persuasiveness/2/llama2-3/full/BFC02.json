You post a small ad on the internet, for example, on Craigslist. After a few days, you receive three similar responses, each with a different name. Émilie, Vincent, and Mohamed all express interest in your apartment. You have to choose between them. So, I ask you: who would you choose ? Émilie, Vincent, or me? You can answer quickly without hesitation.\n\nIn reality, the three responses you received are fake. They were sent by a researcher. The researcher is trying to analyze and determine if you prefer a certain type of person. And that researcher is me. Yes, behind this screen with a software designed for a favorite pastime is sending thousands of messages. I'm in France to study if statistically the chances of getting a response are different for each name. Let's see. My goal is to detect discrimination. And yet, I am not a sociologist or psychologist. No, I am an economist. But economics is not just about finance, debt, crisis, Macron, etc. No, economics also deals with discrimination because it's not efficient for individuals to be discriminated against and end up on the periphery of the city, making it harder to get to work. With this study, we have learned that just by looking at the names, Vincent was twice as likely to get a response as Émilie, and Emilie was the most popular choice among these three individuals. But the difference is not just because of their names. It's because of how they are treated. We are made to analyze and act to combat discrimination and inequality, and we know them by heart.\n\nIf you decide to choose Émilie, does that mean you're sexist towards Vincent or racist towards me? No, not necessarily. You decided to choose Émilie because you think she has more initiative than the boys. And it can't be wrong either. So, I also do some remediation, I must also analyze why Vincent was chosen less often and why Emilie was chosen more often. Maybe there are reasons for this choice that have nothing to do with discrimination. And for that, I need to do a meta-analysis, which is a sort of aggregate study that brings together all the studies done around the world on the same subject to make a single MM study. I have a database of 150,000 emails, which allows me to distinguish between the response rates based on the level of information provided about their lives. From an English speaker who has finished high school.\n\nNow, evaluate the persuasiveness of the public speech in this transcription, that is, how well the person writes a convincing message. Is their reasoning rigorous?
