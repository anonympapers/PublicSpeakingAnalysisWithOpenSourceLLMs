{"model":"llama2","created_at":"2024-04-12T22:22:31.287343461Z","response":"Based on the transcription provided, I would rate the degree of persuasion in the speech as a 4 out of 5. Here's why:\n\n1. The speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, starting with a concise definition of the problem and then laying out their proposed solution. This shows that the speaker has a good understanding of the topic and is able to present their ideas in a logical and organized manner.\n2. The speaker uses technical terms and concepts related to the field of medicine, which suggests that they have a good understanding of the subject matter and are able to communicate their ideas effectively to an audience with a similar level of knowledge.\n3. The speaker provides some evidence to support their claims, such as the mention of \"tests préculénies\" and \"simulations des cas de testes.\" This helps to build credibility and confidence in the speaker's argument.\n4. The speaker acknowledges the limitations of their proposal and mentions that they are still in the research phase, which shows humility and a willingness to engage with criticisms or potential flaws in their idea.\n\nHowever, there are also some areas where the persuasion could be improved:\n\n1. The speaker's tone is somewhat detached and abstract, which may make it difficult for some listeners to connect emotionally with the message. A more personal and engaging tone might help to increase the persuasive power of the speech.\n2. While the speaker provides some evidence to support their claims, they could benefit from providing more detailed examples or case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of their proposed solution. This would help to build credibility and conviction in the audience.\n3. The speaker's use of technical terms and concepts may be somewhat alienating for listeners who are not familiar with these terms. A more straightforward and accessible explanation of the proposal could help to increase its persuasive power.\n\nOverall, the speaker presents a clear and well-structured argument, but could benefit from some adjustments to their tone and evidence to further increase the persuasive power of the speech.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,3830,1281,29149,3830,29871,319,8016,14069,29915,15669,29892,1444,325,1759,7890,610,1358,1465,454,25698,5000,316,20877,29948,1750,378,2265,484,9411,966,17137,1465,5278,269,3498,29889,365,29915,5819,10700,19783,347,4111,262,316,425,4918,29899,2539,29889,315,29915,342,1597,21622,475,4111,262,1750,11943,1173,966,17137,818,8019,270,29915,348,3058,302,482,29892,432,29915,1794,6309,9411,966,17137,29889,27677,3682,29889,360,743,324,29948,966,330,1503,29889,1551,1671,8356,364,465,9945,2257,1750,3435,3948,11992,743,782,1601,21622,475,4111,262,29889,1720,21668,4048,6390,712,4111,262,2453,329,2970,1597,1283,6270,29889,1551,409,16391,454,25698,5000,29892,1444,7890,1518,9854,29889,997,4918,29899,2539,707,427,4356,16976,316,425,3681,29899,29954,1690,1893,744,8622,1810,262,29889,6340,707,13310,1318,610,301,29915,29882,4316,9061,1750,707,5221,271,818,301,29915,5903,10610,316,301,29915,5819,1377,634,868,269,546,29889,1551,2947,2970,712,425,4918,29899,2539,707,1597,772,533,634,301,29915,29882,4316,9061,29892,1597,3300,347,1750,707,425,13310,1318,4837,28148,29889,1720,21668,4048,6390,5695,712,454,7977,316,425,4918,29899,2539,11307,2689,5469,29880,944,2535,301,29915,29282,29889,8748,7015,260,2993,29899,1171,371,800,316,301,29915,29882,4316,9061,325,609,17424,30058,1089,1597,25732,654,316,301,29915,29882,4316,9061,29889,7747,1750,2947,7697,276,301,29915,5903,10610,553,5065,1475,9577,2923,293,5475,992,533,9301,29889,951,25698,5000,409,16391,18916,1044,27751,29889,8748,274,29915,342,425,18836,1671,22025,23563,18554,19406,29887,2406,4079,553,7877,5908,270,29915,29882,1300,359,25179,1893,2406,782,304,284,12973,29889,315,29915,342,454,25698,5000,29892,980,707,925,29872,443,1020,17334,29889,315,29915,342,425,1841,2467,316,425,4918,29899,2539,29889,315,29915,342,1597,521,332,2445,28148,14924,1465,454,8441,634,5646,2257,1750,7199,603,454,364,14785,29889,3872,29883,29892,980,12388,1004,425,3300,347,29889,3185,27751,29892,454,25698,5000,5882,316,5278,1020,17334,29892,274,29915,342,454,10768,1671,12507,29886,1064,7289,29889,1704,454,15935,707,29202,10788,29948,316,1791,261,818,301,29915,29882,30069,29886,2410,13180,553,16283,29889,20513,326,882,818,17168,711,793,29892,553,4473,267,818,263,1241,14954,4630,427,11817,261,1597,15217,11043,1750,707,19172,8356,270,29915,1540,904,29885,283,336,335,347,2123,23930,647,882,427,13545,6233,29889,315,29915,342,6094,616,29889,1459,1136,29948,16011,29892,8556,4625,4224,24969,270,29915,4422,7608,5278,11043,18916,1671,6367,1358,7814,25698,19503,316,23930,647,882,29889,2726,1391,1169,316,19397,7848,29378,459,29948,29892,634,1750,5541,1249,316,1539,2484,443,904,311,332,6367,819,634,270,29915,20041,374,1808,29889,3185,27751,29892,1671,454,289,25747,29888,625,634,425,13047,868,15935,29892,980,707,1399,11936,575,519,316,9073,553,6987,7175,1810,1690,347,1190,443,3165,265,2123,1190,13840,485,276,10042,316,27962,818,301,29915,18949,2406,29899,29894,475,29889,997,1650,712,1444,16193,1044,27751,29892,1465,1601,18848,316,23520,634,712,1444,13942,29877,4798,29892,274,29915,342,316,878,3610,7608,29892,427,12471,17239,410,6112,1387,634,10042,443,12471,17239,301,29915,459,29880,381,21659,2488,1950,610,4239,878,30000,793,13162,15471,7147,29889,1174,4464,316,4824,1387,29892,7890,992,4099,29920,18916,29892,5541,29948,29892,270,29915,6388,267,427,4047,293,650,29892,274,29915,342,1597,5825,7151,18165,23497,29889,5791,4464,270,29915,284,1707,1004,14924,316,9073,4883,21426,6987,8288,316,4880,261,301,29915,9354,265,18165,17239,634,270,29915,20640,7608,966,410,4260,7384,29889,1174,4464,316,301,29915,29965,1949,20600,29892,1750,707,427,4464,316,29231,5495,1190,443,22420,7289,29892,1487,4464,270,29915,284,1707,1004,14924,316,9073,553,23876,553,3209,316,1243,267,712,432,29915,1794,2331,1841,375,1039,818,2756,5218,1190,301,29915,348,4464,316,4824,1387,29889,1720,21668,4048,6390,712,5646,409,6427,8284,29892,19947,1597,9577,289,7293,17043,9948,316,301,29915,273,327,290,347,29892,1597,611,30058,509,895,553,13698,316,26192,634,316,17402,29889,22521,6967,29892,4883,4239,878,30000,793,325,609,286,29915,264,19172,276,316,659,1241,425,8576,7175,29948,695,262,1387,316,1487,13164,11549,277,361,10283,936,634,8288,27516,3479,22069,1597,3667,4371,5994,744,634,269,30095,29878,29889,3872,29883,29892,274,29915,342,1597,15378,545,544,895,427,8323,316,301,29915,5819,10700,19783,347,4111,647,316,425,4918,29899,29928,481,29889,435,29915,1794,2331,427,2600,2172,29889,435,29915,1794,2331,10440,1436,29875,29889,1174,5246,29892,432,29915,1794,4883,304,5475,427,8556,427,285,1007,868,3256,261,29892,1671,712,7890,7890,16391,29920,6079,289,993,9373,29892,274,29915,342,13164,868,3669,29882,1249,316,260,29915,326,915,443,25927,1387,24899,1387,29889,8748,782,2186,29892,5646,302,29915,29948,1376,2331,818,1597,1139,270,29915,9354,359,328,424,425,6316,29889,29871,3830,25026,360,29915,14856,1318,3830,30113,26814,1029,275,29892,7594,707,454,3
