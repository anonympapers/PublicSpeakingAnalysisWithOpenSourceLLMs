{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-24T22:45:33.075309718Z","response":"Based on the transcription provided, I would give a persuasion score of 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker presents their thesis in a clear and concise manner, using examples and anecdotes to illustrate their points. They effectively use rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"il me regarde\", \"je l'or garde\") to engage their audience and make their message more memorable. The speaker's passion and conviction are palpable, which helps to build trust with the listener.\n\nThe only aspect that prevents me from giving a score of 5 out of 5 is the occasional digression or lack of clarity in some parts of the presentation. For example, when discussing the \"face cach√©e\" of modernity, the speaker's explanation is somewhat vague and could be fleshed out further. Additionally, there are moments where the speaker seems to be speaking more to themselves than to their audience, which can disrupt the flow of the presentation.\n\nOverall, however, the speaker presents a compelling argument that is well-organized and engagingly delivered.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,1393,9805,68,1393,220,426,1116,11,503,6,30992,2428,2852,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,31769,2629,285,3869,356,8039,89577,4821,265,11,665,75878,829,463,1557,11,389,2624,1088,11,3900,757,62163,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,1208,17536,13,19421,4502,389,9964,66517,75249,7010,1208,17536,949,14465,75871,82,4864,66517,6316,270,4558,325,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,13,7695,3625,433,333,3900,308,59858,264,6502,7631,978,13,19421,27549,1826,1765,75249,9637,270,4558,325,949,14465,75871,82,13,8242,3625,842,343,4558,4978,409,1208,393,23465,1880,409,1208,7281,6241,648,11,665,1417,27970,13,7695,20272,4538,2840,57531,92759,978,11,3900,757,62163,951,51625,6948,13,7695,274,55624,978,22550,13,7777,11,4864,36731,7010,7643,3273,1557,11,39043,66167,6316,70477,346,11,4864,757,86345,13,2998,20272,11,3625,2624,2530,1765,514,463,911,12416,11,514,82620,11,3625,91225,575,811,11,15132,22299,514,81337,11715,409,1208,70477,346,13,24703,934,54386,11412,917,8023,39015,6617,13109,13,356,17771,3846,1744,326,54386,17317,20605,265,11,272,17771,1744,326,54386,4160,275,33670,16968,13,34447,326,58736,17194,52842,42625,514,5553,519,409,20662,70477,346,11,1744,9964,3567,1572,11,10071,7930,308,17771,6502,9621,7010,326,6,12828,978,8747,266,13,62408,3663,61387,8047,71925,6960,326,6,454,4099,11,326,52152,809,2521,8082,11,1208,55949,409,76076,28800,13,24703,934,54386,11412,917,8023,39015,37683,13109,13,1611,85722,13509,1604,11,20662,70477,346,7891,285,8047,514,38900,1880,829,1515,2428,409,34501,40280,13,7695,841,25692,379,39929,409,6617,13109,15878,37683,13109,13,362,31632,409,3846,20272,11,41091,11,503,6,44803,325,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,20662,1515,2428,294,94572,15273,75,7010,514,719,409,60946,265,4068,1208,6617,13109,264,5293,978,3869,326,31769,4763,2617,64441,409,3738,288,14121,355,1880,326,31769,4763,2617,7891,2428,951,46106,665,1417,27970,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,13,7695,296,6,20243,2182,11,3900,296,6,20243,2182,6502,11,272,17771,514,296,20243,2182,13,14465,3136,13,2998,51092,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,7010,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,7643,83067,513,15132,3625,78167,1495,65832,13,622,6,49133,22299,3625,69483,61480,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,7930,7591,5192,1924,3625,1280,343,4558,4978,11,389,4790,9425,27750,26633,2267,85460,13,2998,20272,11,4864,514,63762,1744,294,6,16288,6316,85722,294,31769,5192,404,77580,15235,20487,11,951,78199,11,951,270,66474,11,951,12678,409,1742,11,951,15082,11,951,77617,3946,3869,55056,978,11,951,5554,2436,7930,5891,72,89810,51854,37291,7010,1647,43194,13,19421,7930,15132,57705,978,2889,8467,409,20662,1515,2428,1744,503,34155,7591,5589,285,665,2773,804,48901,13,7695,20272,665,13033,68,11,503,6,1138,37093,4272,11,3900,35456,653,802,6733,556,40852,953,11,3900,757,62163,87320,503,34155,2665,13532,409,58673,15610,1765,3846,70927,13,622,34155,75871,13,622,34155,55162,10036,48021,665,41263,20712,1208,6617,13109,11,1208,37683,13109,409,29449,38900,11,7010,514,719,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,1765,3625,1615,978,45045,3435,8467,1880,3608,275,17724,11,2995,408,43711,1370,3625,2624,2530,294,98279,50889,288,55398,81991,12155,49301,13,2009,39474,409,326,22827,332,2515,28674,220,679,17,11,61158,6853,1744,17317,308,41901,57038,6502,1913,72,9952,1208,9349,42345,978,8637,2428,11,1208,9517,4099,1880,1208,21934,294,35329,342,5615,331,1339,45973,3625,2477,24292,266,22589,13,2009,719,409,7643,83067,1826,1913,54960,409,23008,9211,45889,9517,23475,7010,514,81621,5019,64972,60946,265,1208,6671,1180,31037,409,4502,1081,3928,978,7930,63922,668,44093,409,274,59858,1645,566,391,38149,5019,20028,5201,261,28130,64079,11,3663,8065,85182,40280,1880,8065,69026,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,326,6,269,7515,451,11,4864,326,6,269,7515,451,11,3900,22011,11,23128,6033,2852,11,92759,519,13,1252,47838,2807,265,30,426,1116,11,503,34155,9071,978,294,6,30992,72684,7643,83067,13,256,8651,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,1393,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,8651,445,52152,3099,1393,27887,970,89,1208,5457,409,98224,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,1765,1208,2385,409,1208,46940,3116,11044,7010,514,9805,68,13,5034,47371,4144,409,1208,98224,1826,3116,11044,7010,3625,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,13,4275,21559,89,934,22827,74206,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,6316,5296,1880,42182,23761,33537,978,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,16,3869,220,20,13,220,16,8024,3869,6502,3930,16968,24613,300,333,1880,220,20,3869,25945,24613,300,333,13,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,46940,3984,11,358,1053,3041,264,98224,5573,315,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,18911,872,17850,304,264,2867,323,64694,11827,11,1701,10507,323,94066,311,41468,872,3585,13,2435,13750,1005,87068,7766,1778,439,54515,3573,321,757,1239,42441,498,3
