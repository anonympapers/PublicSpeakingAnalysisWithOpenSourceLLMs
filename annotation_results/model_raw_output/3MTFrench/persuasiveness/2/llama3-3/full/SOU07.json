{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-24T22:35:52.556012282Z","response":"After analyzing the transcription, I would give a persuasion score of 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker's reasoning is generally rigorous and well-structured. They provide specific examples to illustrate their points, such as the differences between detecting rume (cold) symptoms versus intellectual deficiency symptoms. The use of personal anecdotes and everyday language helps to make complex scientific concepts more accessible and relatable.\n\nThe speaker also uses effective storytelling techniques, such as the example of a child with intellectual deficiency being asked to perform math calculations, which creates an emotional connection with the audience. The tone is engaging and enthusiastic, conveying the speaker's passion for their research and its potential impact on people's lives.\n\nHowever, the persuasion score could be 5 out of 5 if the speaker were able to provide more concrete evidence or data to support their claims, rather than relying solely on anecdotal examples. Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for greater clarity and concision. Overall, though, the speaker's message is well-articulated, engaging, and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,1393,9805,68,1393,220,356,17771,1208,80091,409,1208,25703,375,1880,951,436,3972,13,9589,54312,934,35329,379,264,951,47104,653,436,3972,1880,7010,1208,71632,30,9580,3869,41091,13,507,2005,11,97507,11,97507,13,356,96287,6502,3930,282,411,321,409,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,13,1952,74282,77422,26725,3625,12104,9769,9004,294,41901,436,3972,13,452,26248,326,31109,301,7930,4020,273,665,1097,1604,3869,1208,83067,13,19421,389,513,3288,6502,25945,665,57128,13,43987,26178,11,13085,89,1744,9189,47592,21965,409,1080,60244,12339,7010,514,29340,13,38891,89,13,356,17771,6502,4046,1325,306,13,1952,841,25692,6502,60019,47929,13,7695,47090,48908,46131,653,32118,4919,2727,20028,409,51309,29340,598,13,445,6496,11,7010,29449,29340,11,514,32118,4919,2727,25692,85877,440,261,1208,22337,20243,495,68,409,1080,60244,12339,13,19421,17317,13510,11,3869,6666,11,9189,665,47592,21965,13,41621,10025,42221,951,5945,79155,1841,4298,2249,44496,3395,5518,13,12095,8791,458,409,68226,85877,440,261,951,22337,20243,2482,71269,333,8467,7010,29449,29340,11,7591,8385,729,75467,324,11,7930,17317,1280,2428,1208,30179,768,6033,326,6,370,77467,978,294,31109,8811,329,648,13,64105,64,29557,294,6,20311,29449,3941,409,17536,11,409,59394,951,35030,292,24469,13,1952,308,26248,6502,5019,40744,3625,8811,17491,13,4366,51173,11,1208,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,11,75804,88253,11,5019,1208,1891,8372,72684,11,3900,47090,20028,951,7177,60538,2436,13,3959,98385,5935,82,409,30276,13,34447,389,841,25692,6502,7631,261,653,33632,519,409,56321,8261,409,20028,951,5935,82,409,30276,13,1708,1105,11,8065,20272,11,951,7177,78422,10515,8467,13,34447,3625,7177,78422,10515,8467,11,16968,3846,934,35329,841,22011,11,272,17771,11,4502,3900,379,264,11,8065,6502,11,6316,27472,934,35329,2107,548,13,7695,841,834,6502,4502,20662,27472,5353,1208,8811,329,648,13,1611,5636,11,3900,1080,30872,668,23008,13,46706,7643,83067,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,1120,1133,653,76057,501,52760,409,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,13,5034,27472,294,22827,1167,5055,15207,8657,275,5019,2211,882,20662,8811,329,648,11,7930,15119,1557,3625,53542,1880,7930,274,53149,6853,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,11,2536,22013,442,2428,13,11842,22013,442,2428,11,39043,76605,13510,1744,3625,12104,9769,9004,56311,2961,1553,7010,8893,3869,326,49455,265,11,3846,7930,1826,17634,84,514,15439,77411,13,2009,1486,4068,66167,934,85217,14848,26725,951,23878,35933,17108,65832,48416,84,5512,11,46152,14848,3930,8811,9952,951,7177,409,1208,17536,409,26725,3625,49301,11,22299,78551,1880,75831,3869,326,6,1334,20272,513,20028,15907,14307,8065,7643,6962,519,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,26577,648,409,46524,951,39538,1132,38647,7010,28130,29340,11,5019,85877,440,261,1208,8811,329,648,5636,259,35657,11,5019,64972,1391,40538,3625,8811,3536,11,44351,1744,28130,463,1557,13,81501,1208,55133,48901,409,7643,83067,11,503,34155,20272,26633,79165,75419,13,88125,14896,11,4864,9189,16796,22011,1744,1208,27472,294,22827,1167,5055,15207,8657,275,5019,2211,882,1208,8811,329,648,13,34447,389,25692,6502,20028,16968,653,1179,68,934,80720,88411,11,3869,259,331,19010,316,11,5019,326,57286,664,1291,13,1708,1105,11,503,34155,3608,90859,3846,27584,15207,11,10071,46206,326,22827,4647,1557,13,1252,67781,11,653,6160,38469,389,69152,71151,1208,4647,1557,665,37622,934,6,8629,44618,83597,13,1611,2249,90272,14896,3062,11,503,34155,20272,85114,1367,28154,2436,46206,1208,4647,1557,11,1880,503,34155,3608,90859,951,22337,20243,2482,71269,333,8467,11,7930,274,6,613,372,29580,41869,25843,11,1120,1133,42676,514,15207,304,47391,10515,290,1826,5318,978,13,43987,26178,11,503,6,26577,648,409,46131,4502,272,17771,24068,321,46206,326,6,87713,13,14465,36731,11751,519,3930,934,35329,1826,9071,978,409,46131,4502,11,294,6,434,321,1130,7930,2605,1188,409,3930,29340,11,951,6978,1880,4864,3625,9616,9952,951,924,75004,15878,13,11876,33651,4881,22337,20243,2482,15890,4864,9189,1370,273,11,7591,809,15974,294,6,1334,6316,409,1380,79,12339,13,19421,75804,88253,11,46152,3073,306,951,14645,5019,3625,85877,440,261,7010,514,29340,13,423,10515,440,261,6316,47371,292,1873,17108,31037,87264,56316,28463,4382,1744,951,85877,440,5512,665,436,3972,13,34447,77433,8065,39538,277,441,324,3930,18111,324,11,389,25692,2961,5615,466,409,7631,261,514,46110,945,324,3869,951,60404,409,490,15969,13,256,8651,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,1393,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,8651,445,52152,3099,1393,27887,970,89,1208,5457,409,98224,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,1765,1208,2385,409,1208,46940,3116,11044,7010,514,9805,68,13,5034,47371,4144,409,1208,98224,1826,3116,11044,7010,3625,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,13,4275,21559,89,934,22827,74206,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,6316,5296,1880,42182,23761,33537,978,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,16,3869,220,20,
