In 2017, one in seven people in the world traveled around the planet. This made Occitania the 4th region of France for Foreign Tourist COI. Here, tourism is an essential sector. It attracted nearly 300 million individuals. You realize 300 millions is five times the French population. I'm convinced that Occitania has everything it takes to welcome and serve these new clients. So imagine, how can our Tourism Industry do this? This is New Tourism. You have references when you travel, don't you? I think our Indian tourists also need signposts. And that's where I come in with solutions. Matisse focuses on all the tools that will allow us to welcome, retain, and bring back these new tourists. What process should we put in place? What interactions, what techniques? Why not a new brand? You got it? Matisse is proactive. Economy, management, marketing, sociology, this research concerns everyone because everyone is involved in this project. Closely or from afar, this research is important.\"\n\nInput Data: \"In your opinion, to what extent is the persuasive power of this speech in the given transcription, meaning that the person effectively conveys a convincing message?
