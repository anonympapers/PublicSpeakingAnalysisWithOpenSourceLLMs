{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-24T21:49:54.892395622Z","response":"After analyzing the transcription, I would give a persuasion score of 4 out of 5.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The speaker presents their argument in a clear and organized manner, using logical connections between ideas.\n* They use concrete examples to illustrate their points, such as the analogy between prison and hospital services.\n* The speaker shows a good understanding of the law and the penitentiary system, which lends credibility to their argument.\n* They acknowledge potential counterarguments (e.g., the possibility that the state may not be able to provide adequate services) and address them implicitly by emphasizing the importance of rehabilitation.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give a perfect score because:\n\n* The speaker's language is sometimes overly formal or technical, which might make it harder for some listeners to follow their argument.\n* There are a few places where the speaker seems to be repeating themselves or using phrases that feel somewhat redundant (e.g., \"La peine de prison doit donc offrir autre chose que l'horizon obscure n'entrounoir au d√©tenu\").\n\nOverall, I think the speaker presents a compelling and well-reasoned argument that is likely to persuade listeners who are familiar with the topic.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,1393,9805,68,1393,220,24703,1744,9189,23933,10333,70374,2761,65220,41091,11,272,17771,653,490,263,56662,13,1252,31260,64934,273,5455,7930,264,5019,4040,13109,294,93825,28463,17251,68,11,7930,326,6,3342,5615,1557,43905,57128,409,41263,20712,409,27750,38838,978,13,1952,22011,409,25400,934,35329,1826,3469,81235,30547,13,14465,841,36731,6502,12025,22761,1065,3457,26193,13,14465,841,66517,6502,409,64441,10484,2428,13080,27584,409,7033,978,8637,8467,13,2893,45985,294,6,40997,9189,97057,653,28800,294,93825,1744,4864,841,36731,27584,6502,6316,7330,52760,13,14465,36731,16422,17194,13,34447,503,34155,2665,13532,409,1615,582,43711,1195,294,49152,13603,259,4105,11,653,31260,7930,7591,10188,16968,3154,519,13,2009,6225,34561,934,22827,490,263,56662,1826,7930,25400,28463,11,665,503,6,40997,653,35174,40634,11,1208,9527,13,12623,54008,67882,11,503,34155,3930,22011,326,31769,23013,9465,514,85877,1509,1880,1208,1332,4138,281,10610,275,768,324,13,445,6,306,408,11,514,85877,1509,1826,4046,5531,90859,294,6,395,773,978,2442,57375,8065,2532,586,30,7695,1826,824,79884,22299,6316,54613,5945,74306,3869,1208,1332,4138,11,7600,15433,978,409,65835,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,294,6,677,7864,367,8065,1841,321,42182,513,26965,261,32592,1069,483,409,45361,13,65381,326,58736,45534,3930,22165,272,17771,326,6,495,3457,9400,12339,6033,326,31769,61023,978,3930,57951,1880,39723,3900,1826,6223,978,294,6,9035,13109,13,1369,84,1001,11,4502,3625,63846,17724,409,5945,4150,10367,514,85877,1509,3869,951,30255,11,45602,308,17771,6502,8657,285,519,5019,93381,71933,1208,1620,13109,409,1208,1069,483,13,2998,67781,11,16968,1069,483,42182,46524,653,4046,447,31059,265,9465,85114,1665,22589,13,46408,42182,45361,1215,326,26248,40095,294,31109,4225,16597,5019,1647,95920,514,46838,4575,541,409,1208,77824,1880,294,6,15782,556,951,46106,409,1081,7211,265,653,1180,68,1675,10746,556,11,10071,27549,42182,28463,594,82,3746,532,12329,13,3700,4150,10367,3869,326,6,485,65023,84,409,60946,265,4538,1180,68,54401,409,841,6502,9517,66,1814,13,5034,1069,483,409,9527,42182,39587,1022,38315,47838,14896,1744,326,6,20100,17403,40634,308,6,306,583,2201,404,8065,85877,1509,13,27058,1744,1208,9527,44829,325,4046,566,978,424,326,6,5389,404,3930,85877,1509,11,514,30714,409,2018,8977,6316,51913,3294,7930,264,24560,99253,66,8047,41199,51854,65838,1880,1744,503,34155,18757,22842,665,14240,41939,3625,96642,1495,288,409,82291,1880,3625,35881,6948,3930,357,560,13,14465,30714,409,61747,514,85877,1509,3930,29005,70,978,11,3930,2532,586,281,10610,275,306,3675,13,1252,10648,3930,2532,586,7591,8747,729,951,97222,7010,326,57286,266,1862,68,40192,11,1880,274,6,74972,81186,3930,64079,8065,34501,40280,4725,3930,2532,586,1880,3930,64079,3869,326,6,54203,294,31109,864,20762,409,1208,961,3930,2532,586,13,80905,22299,514,11939,11,3930,10648,3930,2532,586,8952,1291,11,3869,514,64079,3869,653,305,9769,79,2223,7930,34501,818,665,3136,13,19421,7010,951,4787,20399,17724,39039,17724,1880,3869,514,64079,294,6,677,2002,404,951,779,1354,11,514,85877,1509,42182,68226,84233,59728,1291,409,4787,409,85877,3012,294,6,625,288,11,15878,1765,45541,75566,3333,1880,64290,404,6316,864,20762,409,1208,961,409,1208,8735,11,6316,864,20762,7930,1826,842,9486,1370,1208,1069,483,1880,7930,11412,3625,71751,3930,6225,11,6316,864,20762,409,9517,4302,290,13,1369,84,1001,11,4502,75804,88253,514,64079,3869,7591,9233,294,57286,3012,55668,264,24560,33449,978,11,514,64079,3869,1208,9517,4302,290,294,58736,17194,1744,409,85722,25636,68,1370,1208,9313,294,49455,265,64079,11,19227,1744,514,64079,3869,6316,17536,44526,20487,13,27058,61512,11,272,17771,1208,9517,4302,290,7930,11412,29557,10367,326,6,6581,292,580,45973,1208,9517,3002,1130,13,84081,66522,11,8065,65385,11,514,2863,332,3930,10648,3930,2532,586,281,10610,275,306,13327,1765,514,39587,6316,14240,2070,21901,44186,11,27549,29557,30532,294,6,677,7864,52424,326,6,32960,266,3869,91878,3625,11148,1220,42138,1370,261,4538,54606,7010,1208,77824,13,46408,29557,30532,6316,9517,76701,665,2848,17675,324,3930,72601,281,10610,278,5019,653,72601,5636,31914,580,13,1708,1105,11,4864,841,63762,6502,409,75249,1647,81652,5014,665,35737,20272,11,10071,1208,86806,14896,1744,4864,46206,11,272,17771,934,6,60917,12416,220,23,8261,11,41091,4864,841,1208,63762,48647,6502,13,256,8651,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,1393,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,8651,445,52152,3099,1393,27887,970,89,1208,5457,409,98224,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,1765,1208,2385,409,1208,46940,3116,11044,7010,514,9805,68,13,5034,47371,4144,409,1208,98224,1826,3116,11044,7010,3625,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,13,4275,21559,89,934,22827,74206,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,6316,5296,1880,42182,23761,33537,978,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,16,3869,220,2
