This approach is well-structured and easy to follow.\n* The use of rhetorical questions (\"Qu'est-ce que Ã§a signifie?\" / \"Comment s'y prendre?\") effectively engages the audience and encourages them to reflect on their own experiences.\n* The speaker's passion for their research and commitment to contributing to a better future for students are contagious.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that some parts of the text might feel slightly too self-referential or focused on the author's personal experience. However, overall, this discourse effectively conveys a persuasive message about the need for transformative change in education.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,1393,9805,68,1393,220,14465,91507,9189,20028,6316,2389,5397,11,44829,593,503,34155,59062,978,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,757,6225,653,28800,3846,934,85217,1022,3833,645,13,14465,36731,294,26248,670,12844,5048,665,26633,90272,76132,11,10071,4864,36731,28463,31025,484,12339,10696,55180,2428,3869,326,22827,1986,13109,409,1208,36969,6853,13,19421,3869,3846,64160,11,4864,66517,48901,409,1647,57951,294,6,71484,13,507,8772,651,68636,11,39043,11412,23761,79380,51794,3869,342,52424,26725,3625,49301,13,2998,27138,11,31025,484,12339,10696,55180,2428,11,503,6,582,5807,24812,3625,68061,625,1821,409,326,22827,1986,13109,7010,1208,18475,409,28130,95234,13,34447,294,3695,1474,6870,11,74940,1826,326,48968,2868,273,409,326,6,1137,625,1133,1043,57663,75804,88253,30,64105,64,34280,7998,11,7010,1647,11159,13109,11,389,77554,12339,1744,326,41901,3841,84,1826,17028,978,11,326,6,4302,290,85505,294,22827,5636,6800,13026,294,57286,21178,1821,13,2582,1180,77776,11,389,738,349,1744,29449,72601,294,6,1137,625,1133,281,48099,3869,75871,265,3869,653,19227,665,3841,84,11,9952,951,14240,21178,1821,7930,26725,3625,47104,7930,409,326,22827,1986,13109,15132,17347,9769,9004,11,6033,7930,841,26483,688,6502,294,6,31310,285,3869,1208,6520,40095,409,28130,46160,13,7695,1826,39587,4433,4469,5019,326,22827,1986,13109,409,513,43678,13,62408,18475,2109,974,1765,653,68061,625,1133,39239,978,2536,5636,1765,514,47929,11,10071,1765,3625,14240,21178,1821,25400,98375,13,1221,5192,4558,79507,11,934,17771,54312,1744,39043,1879,57609,30,19421,14707,11,389,11412,52895,716,951,281,15433,55180,648,1180,1924,11,45889,3930,42775,665,3941,46494,11,5019,29557,10367,3869,326,57286,21178,1821,409,52895,716,951,75332,2436,9604,1157,7010,514,38900,85505,13,7695,379,264,951,47104,3869,76076,308,7085,409,2848,934,54386,348,76019,1824,3159,7930,264,1367,14081,3904,951,55744,8467,9721,15844,13,34447,1826,54312,1744,45602,8657,275,3869,43678,514,72601,30,35211,1133,6502,11,16968,7591,10188,978,11,39587,409,45347,409,45889,28271,13399,14014,11,3869,6316,9517,6853,5276,8047,1765,11191,951,55744,8467,7010,326,52152,10663,13,19421,22299,503,26248,547,3625,47371,285,11,272,17771,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,34447,4068,71751,653,68061,625,1133,934,35329,379,3625,308,17771,27584,6502,32980,41199,220,508,8261,11,294,6,370,11283,1215,951,6183,21237,951,30597,13,27058,41091,11,4538,1208,8246,294,31109,48659,3608,13109,409,326,6,1149,3675,38317,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,409,18475,3284,13,7695,308,59858,264,6502,409,8246,3608,60224,3284,11,4502,389,308,26248,27584,6502,3625,68061,625,1821,3869,4046,73931,1880,3869,58673,15610,6667,91640,13,507,2005,11,665,5589,514,80259,11,272,17771,1744,326,6,1137,625,1133,1826,6316,4197,13109,25945,2092,60224,13,1708,1105,4068,274,59858,59394,30,3206,45455,4558,325,1826,934,35329,47090,48021,3625,48577,665,2389,5397,11,5019,934,80720,513,3288,68,13171,409,274,6,833,1435,7010,27750,6667,22589,13,11583,79641,1132,68,6824,68,3869,75831,951,6667,22589,409,42775,9952,3625,68061,625,1821,98733,17724,1880,20028,665,80444,1744,27750,6667,22589,528,4558,70,1157,5208,91640,653,40351,14425,275,1765,514,68061,59110,11,10071,28463,951,1732,36527,11398,266,22589,11,951,1180,38647,3930,38900,3674,82653,2428,11,1880,14707,4046,1325,336,479,951,14240,21178,1821,13,426,1116,11,326,6,49575,951,1180,38647,5019,6316,9517,6853,18475,3930,72601,11,1880,272,17771,39015,39723,39043,513,4684,2428,13,4366,346,1744,41091,28463,11,4864,66517,48901,3930,72601,13,1708,1105,9189,12584,89,757,13510,10071,4068,25692,85815,1744,9964,3026,285,6316,38317,2764,1880,282,2205,13,19421,14707,11,4864,91507,296,804,951,1218,2171,80463,1880,951,36744,9517,12287,22589,13,14465,91507,8678,805,951,36788,409,42775,294,6,370,541,9952,3625,68061,625,1821,11,10071,28463,9952,3625,14240,21178,1821,1880,9952,1208,31025,484,12339,281,15433,55180,2428,13,2895,66096,3869,20662,38317,11,503,6,25632,12339,6044,8977,10253,18803,27476,3808,281,15433,55180,8467,409,326,6,1137,625,1133,1043,57663,55467,13,19421,3869,1208,84788,635,294,22827,5636,6800,13026,294,57286,21178,1821,11,45889,779,285,2922,6496,53454,11,45889,779,285,2922,6496,1370,2126,13,34447,294,3695,39587,11,9189,841,1765,74466,6502,665,5542,294,6,31830,6316,23846,85815,11,3846,7930,513,259,6,49133,949,220,1393,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,1393,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,8651,445,52152,3099,1393,27887,970,89,1208,5457,409,98224,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,1765,1208,2385,409,1208,46940,3116,11044,7010,514,9805,68,13,5034,47371,4144,409,1208,98224,1826,3116,11044,7010,3625,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,13,4275,21559,89,934,22827,74206,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,6316,5296,1880,42182,23761,33537,978,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,16,3869,220,20,
