{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-04-24T21:25:38.887746689Z","response":"After analyzing the transcription, I would rate the persuasive power of this public performance as 4 out of 5.\n\nThe speaker effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (\"c'est très bien\", \"on besoin\"), emotional appeals (\"Mataise est prospégative\"), and logical reasoning to build a convincing argument. The use of statistics (\"une personne sur 7 dans le monde a voyagé\") adds credibility to the message. The speaker also creates a sense of urgency by highlighting the competition with other destinations (\"ils sont en train de largement en prospecter le marché indien\").\n\nThe only aspect that could be improved is the structure and organization of the speech, which sometimes feels a bit disjointed. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which might make it harder for the audience to follow the argument.\n\nOverall, however, the speaker's passion, enthusiasm, and logical reasoning make this performance quite persuasive.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,1393,9805,68,1393,220,507,12825,3625,84064,417,3930,14986,44618,13,921,20234,76132,11,3900,5208,13,19421,272,17771,25945,14707,13,3263,42441,89,665,220,679,22,13,39783,54613,1765,220,22,7010,514,38900,264,23933,351,978,90053,409,1208,3197,66522,13,64105,64,50590,348,2784,1744,326,88766,87,13145,648,1826,1208,220,19,68,88100,409,9822,5019,1208,7432,40,951,14986,75460,4046,376,14381,13,19421,49733,11,514,14986,44618,11,272,17771,653,991,5481,648,1765,220,605,13,64105,64,50590,348,2784,1744,326,22827,85877,408,9484,409,46131,39043,513,514,37417,52138,26193,93381,396,409,84364,409,220,3101,11990,294,6,485,65023,355,13,41621,9189,66651,42463,220,3101,11990,11,272,17771,272,6009,37291,1208,7187,93424,13,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,36731,5804,467,20811,1744,326,88766,87,13145,648,264,26725,3625,3869,16968,5019,15907,294,1439,20662,48659,3016,51453,13,1708,1105,13085,89,13,12535,958,1018,461,22299,514,308,9769,10367,25692,20028,5019,15907,294,1439,30,356,17771,43453,14986,17194,13,41621,11,42676,9189,45165,15292,89,45325,47592,951,2109,31539,30,19421,14707,41091,11,4864,73953,1744,3625,14986,75460,1280,1188,28463,11,389,63669,409,2109,31539,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,503,34155,9964,22011,951,10105,13,89454,1082,6033,3846,10219,265,1765,26725,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,294,69537,361,484,404,11,312,2002,404,1880,20028,19443,404,27750,87325,14986,75460,13,3489,6853,1920,355,48021,665,2035,30,3489,37907,22639,11,934,2053,12823,30,19421,87320,6502,6316,48659,75467,30,41621,326,6,52659,13550,285,30,89454,1082,1826,463,2203,19395,1413,13,29124,45317,648,11,59471,11,75467,12,354,85005,11,15983,38469,11,20662,38317,3613,68495,16968,514,38900,66021,934,80720,11,66021,1744,16968,514,38900,1826,11866,76366,7010,3846,46494,13,1611,84364,6033,409,78060,11,20662,38317,1826,3062,13,1708,1105,11,4864,73953,1744,12155,14986,75460,1280,80463,11,389,63669,11,934,54386,513,24671,409,1131,2009,293,858,333,409,1647,42775,1826,409,282,15433,52424,3625,7970,4978,98733,5512,13,46706,326,39982,9769,23774,11151,321,11,1208,98052,2060,11,3625,6732,31070,8467,11,1880,27584,9189,11,4502,9964,439,379,653,11,7010,26317,6299,13,1708,1105,11,272,17771,83195,11,3900,379,264,12366,11,272,17771,7970,13,7695,379,264,514,1647,10167,91340,356,24540,11,3900,379,264,326,39982,9769,23774,409,9822,11,10071,274,1815,89,1744,84440,11,46152,15132,665,5542,409,4143,1133,665,22199,261,514,84751,1280,3675,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,25632,12339,11,503,6,25632,12339,11,10071,294,58591,978,1869,53819,11,1744,9189,5945,10176,408,23577,409,3846,4545,13,622,6,25632,12339,1744,3846,4545,35737,514,1131,1252,4545,3062,11,7970,9189,13,19421,503,6,25632,12339,1744,87158,9189,91026,978,951,31070,288,1826,103763,5512,7010,29449,7317,6491,556,11,9189,9189,958,299,1414,89,11,9189,11,1765,3846,1744,9189,45366,20028,11,5019,64972,3625,1046,361,484,404,13,256,8651,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,1393,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,8651,445,52152,3099,1393,27887,970,89,1208,5457,409,98224,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,1765,1208,2385,409,1208,46940,3116,11044,7010,514,9805,68,13,5034,47371,4144,409,1208,98224,1826,3116,11044,7010,3625,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,13,4275,21559,89,934,22827,74206,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,6316,5296,1880,42182,23761,33537,978,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,16,3869,220,20,13,220,16,8024,3869,6502,3930,16968,24613,300,333,1880,220,20,3869,25945,24613,300,333,13,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,6153,42118,279,46940,11,358,1053,4478,279,66343,2410,315,420,586,5178,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,791,19114,13750,5829,87068,7766,1778,439,54515,3573,66,6,478,25945,14707,498,330,263,63669,4063,14604,35730,3573,44,460,1082,1826,463,2203,19395,1413,4063,323,20406,33811,311,1977,264,40661,5811,13,578,1005,315,13443,3573,2957,54613,1765,220,22,7010,514,38900,264,23933,351,978,909,11621,38769,311,279,1984,13,578,19114,1101,11705,264,5647,315,54917,555,39686,279,10937,449,1023,34205,3573,8839,15132,665,5542,409,4143,1133,665,22199,261,514,84751,1280,3675,1865,198,198,791,1193,13189,430,1436,387,13241,374,279,6070,323,7471,315,279,8982,11,902,7170,11321,264,2766,85884,291,13,23212,11,1063,315,279,23719,527,5115,1317,323,5804,337,2844,11,902,2643,1304,433,16127,369,279,10877,311,1833,279,5811,627,198,28589,11,4869,11,279,19114,596,11939,11,36232,11,323,20406,33811,1304,420,5178,5115,66343,13,128009],"total_duration":45021525547,"load_duration":237133,"prompt_eval_count":751,"prompt_eval_duration":3194841000,"eval_count":190,"eval_duration":41825878000}
