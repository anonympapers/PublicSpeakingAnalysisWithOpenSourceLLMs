L'orateur présente des arguments solides pour soutenir sa thèse, mais il y a quelques points où le raisonnement peut être amélioré :\n\n1. Lack of clarity: Sometimes, the speaker's words are not very clear, making it difficult for the listener to follow their argument. For example, when discussing the use of biomarkers to detect pollutants in water, the speaker uses terms like \"millions of information\" and \"base de données,\" but does not provide any clarification on what these terms mean.\n2. Lack of evidence: While the speaker provides some examples of how their technique could be used to detect pollutants in water, they do not provide enough evidence to convince the listener of the effectiveness of their approach. More research and data are needed to support the claims made in the discourse.\n3. Lack of contextualization: The speaker does not provide enough context for the listener to fully understand the significance of their work. For example, they do not explain why detecting pollutants in water is important or how it could impact public health. Providing more background information and context would help to make the discourse more compelling.\n4. Overemphasis on technology: While the speaker's technique may be innovative, they spend too much time discussing the technical details of their method and not enough time explaining its potential impact. The listener is left wondering why this approach is necessary and how it could make a difference in the real world.\n5. Lack of passion: The speaker does not show enough enthusiasm or passion for their work, which can make their discourse come across as dry and unengaging. Passion and conviction are important qualities for any public speaker to have, as they help to engage and inspire the audience.\n\nOverall, while there are some valid points made in the discourse, the speaker could benefit from providing more context, evidence, and passion to make their message more convincing and persuasive.","done":true,"context":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,1523,2109,292,26442,29901,3830,1281,29149,3830,29871,2581,26099,454,5094,495,29899,1867,2801,553,907,29894,21158,29892,8570,29892,18729,452,2453,329,2331,2970,712,1444,26099,818,611,260,11689,19964,29889,11948,29871,4277,1136,2488,427,439,7768,1671,844,22687,4191,7890,454,4078,29920,9411,966,5039,7719,3165,13116,29892,1391,275,296,316,25226,1248,6092,1934,302,29915,342,5172,1671,301,29915,21813,17239,29889,315,29915,342,1248,6092,424,8164,409,5663,8885,1465,454,316,7814,364,8107,5908,29892,3503,3440,8164,29899,265,325,1064,3709,425,4021,2131,316,301,29915,14531,29973,1551,1671,8356,9073,553,3248,1179,29889,5462,409,1209,1572,993,29899,2719,1354,966,1248,6092,1934,3435,337,4026,743,1465,454,301,870,29875,634,439,29915,348,9638,22781,4313,12161,454,9691,1127,29875,29973,2664,3248,1179,409,2143,609,1559,966,1248,6092,1934,409,724,609,766,546,29883,743,29889,1720,21668,12866,534,8885,443,2730,11771,316,4313,30069,1358,427,9410,663,425,4021,2131,316,301,29915,14531,29889,4731,8105,882,29892,966,7903,1295,22700,743,553,288,895,2993,2649,267,553,1644,262,4999,1750,269,29915,2749,11992,296,316,521,14623,427,29845,316,10489,517,29916,1387,29889,435,4422,267,454,6701,29095,29892,269,4987,712,611,1644,262,1808,29892,274,29915,342,1597,12563,22577,907,29894,2353,29892,611,2428,8508,454,330,4850,538,29889,8748,1465,24145,3209,29892,24145,7182,270,29915,18362,371,29892,274,29915,342,1661,2331,1597,8825,298,3409,9061,29892,3503,425,1644,2353,316,24145,907,29894,2353,1750,2947,409,1437,629,1664,427,29845,316,1248,6092,1934,29889,8748,274,29915,342,18916,712,1601,18848,316,5094,495,1867,2801,24108,29889,6803,1437,371,312,261,553,4439,328,583,14255,301,29915,21708,29892,454,652,370,12973,610,17488,29892,373,2947,3248,261,553,6062,29948,21337,316,480,1037,29889,14255,425,907,29894,2353,29892,1444,325,1759,3248,261,10741,6062,29948,21337,29892,3503,5697,1169,5152,1080,818,7006,966,4768,290,279,446,1295,29892,1750,325,609,592,19172,276,316,17043,13639,1487,2852,271,316,20877,29948,29892,634,12866,316,4048,6390,1354,4875,263,4370,427,29845,316,1248,6092,1934,29889,997,11043,316,3248,482,316,7015,4768,290,279,446,1295,8556,285,2905,277,1597,29835,270,29915,331,558,17316,29892,427,4951,1597,29892,2298,260,9373,553,3533,4285,29889,8748,1671,19397,1006,558,26283,7015,953,1457,9893,29892,1444,16623,4191,425,10974,29892,1444,966,7252,818,1597,2967,316,21880,29889,8748,1465,24145,3209,29892,274,29915,342,27282,29892,274,29915,342,454,22191,26052,6094,19971,316,425,907,29894,2353,29892,2257,27965,1314,11033,29940,29889,951,4224,19177,3116,482,316,425,360,29940,27666,553,14746,316,19313,712,1444,19760,2894,7608,1671,9484,261,611,2967,316,21880,29889,8649,4285,29892,14746,29892,1444,452,1236,1314,2331,454,9073,20536,29889,8748,274,29915,342,1671,29871,4277,712,1444,26099,443,5094,495,1867,2801,29889,435,29915,4422,895,1601,22420,7289,1190,27612,1444,14543,371,553,1824,4467,29892,1671,19397,16455,643,14984,7015,21880,427,13545,26893,818,425,2058,316,13545,3533,4285,270,29915,812,2406,29889,8407,2186,29892,29871,4277,263,443,7006,4191,425,2602,2393,1387,29889,11948,1354,2560,29892,634,6079,1661,29892,427,22259,2131,29892,980,19947,10741,1197,28141,316,907,29894,21158,29889,8748,12866,29892,18679,439,29915,1808,302,29915,609,2331,363,29883,15471,966,286,30037,4467,1841,7387,3479,1248,6092,1934,29892,1465,611,266,17449,29892,1444,592,10484,276,1190,966,4832,1197,28141,316,907,29894,21158,1750,3435,966,2298,11984,427,4092,29889,8748,1444,325,1064,28821,29892,1354,966,11118,787,1766,16011,18165,29876,296,6079,1671,12563,29892,610,346,439,29915,309,707,10019,680,29885,358,29892,4875,302,29915,609,2331,363,29883,15471,425,6701,1841,2467,3479,1248,6092,1934,29892,4191,1444,966,6309,16784,29948,2310,358,29889,2581,325,1759,7890,1153,535,357,1597,22577,385,687,29881,866,29889,751,392,373,286,29915,29874,6309,712,432,29915,1794,29231,23589,1190,425,907,29894,2353,29892,23272,882,29892,1444,282,1947,712,274,29915,14386,1597,1999,3437,29889,11948,1436,6311,29892,7907,7732,6063,316,6316,7096,29892,1444,7890,652,23469,712,5278,24988,1004,263,2428,8508,302,29915,342,2331,439,29915,1540,2560,907,29894,2353,29889,315,29915,342,443,27128,519,394,492,29948,1465,425,1437,371,428,868,9703,29889,8748,12866,29892,1444,652,23469,712,29892,269,29915,542,4979,546,316,872,20877,29948,29892,274,29915,342,16269,358,712,29892,274,29915,342,2331,425,6701,12784,29889,29871,3830,25026,360,29915,14856,1318,3830,30113,26814,1029,275,29892,7594,707,454,316,20792,316,20408,7002,868,2313,2470,1465,5278,1301,3395,29892,274,29915,342,29899,30001,29899,20146,712,425,26744,1841,29881,2231,6366,562,882,443,2643,7602,475,29883,424,1577,5791,18836,17239,707,29899,309,12912,25664,1314,1577,8876,365,29915,2611,4080,3830,30062,1767,29920,425,4889,316,20408,7002,316,425,4180,2529,9854,1190,425,2967,316,425,1301,3395,3023,2786,1465,454,1281,29149,29889,997,11482,3475,316,425,20408,700
