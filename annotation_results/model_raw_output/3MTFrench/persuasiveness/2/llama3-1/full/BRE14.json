This approach can be persuasive because it creates a sense of intimacy and shared understanding.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't give it a perfect score (5) because:\n\n* The speech could benefit from more concrete evidence or statistics to support the speaker's claims.\n* The language is sometimes overly casual (\"c'est le m√©coute\", \"il prend un arpaire plaix\"), which might detract from the overall effectiveness of the message.\n\nOverall, I think this speaker has done a great job of building rapport with their audience and presenting their ideas in an engaging way. With some additional refinement to address my minor criticisms, they could potentially be even more persuasive!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,1393,9805,68,1393,220,426,1116,11,503,6,30992,2428,2852,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,31769,2629,285,3869,356,8039,89577,4821,265,11,665,75878,829,463,1557,11,389,2624,1088,11,3900,757,62163,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,1208,17536,13,19421,4502,389,9964,66517,75249,7010,1208,17536,949,14465,75871,82,4864,66517,6316,270,4558,325,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,13,7695,3625,433,333,3900,308,59858,264,6502,7631,978,13,19421,27549,1826,1765,75249,9637,270,4558,325,949,14465,75871,82,13,8242,3625,842,343,4558,4978,409,1208,393,23465,1880,409,1208,7281,6241,648,11,665,1417,27970,13,7695,20272,4538,2840,57531,92759,978,11,3900,757,62163,951,51625,6948,13,7695,274,55624,978,22550,13,7777,11,4864,36731,7010,7643,3273,1557,11,39043,66167,6316,70477,346,11,4864,757,86345,13,2998,20272,11,3625,2624,2530,1765,514,463,911,12416,11,514,82620,11,3625,91225,575,811,11,15132,22299,514,81337,11715,409,1208,70477,346,13,24703,934,54386,11412,917,8023,39015,6617,13109,13,356,17771,3846,1744,326,54386,17317,20605,265,11,272,17771,1744,326,54386,4160,275,33670,16968,13,34447,326,58736,17194,52842,42625,514,5553,519,409,20662,70477,346,11,1744,9964,3567,1572,11,10071,7930,308,17771,6502,9621,7010,326,6,12828,978,8747,266,13,62408,3663,61387,8047,71925,6960,326,6,454,4099,11,326,52152,809,2521,8082,11,1208,55949,409,76076,28800,13,24703,934,54386,11412,917,8023,39015,37683,13109,13,1611,85722,13509,1604,11,20662,70477,346,7891,285,8047,514,38900,1880,829,1515,2428,409,34501,40280,13,7695,841,25692,379,39929,409,6617,13109,15878,37683,13109,13,362,31632,409,3846,20272,11,41091,11,503,6,44803,325,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,20662,1515,2428,294,94572,15273,75,7010,514,719,409,60946,265,4068,1208,6617,13109,264,5293,978,3869,326,31769,4763,2617,64441,409,3738,288,14121,355,1880,326,31769,4763,2617,7891,2428,951,46106,665,1417,27970,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,13,7695,296,6,20243,2182,11,3900,296,6,20243,2182,6502,11,272,17771,514,296,20243,2182,13,14465,3136,13,2998,51092,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,7010,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,7643,83067,513,15132,3625,78167,1495,65832,13,622,6,49133,22299,3625,69483,61480,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,7930,7591,5192,1924,3625,1280,343,4558,4978,11,389,4790,9425,27750,26633,2267,85460,13,2998,20272,11,4864,514,63762,1744,294,6,16288,6316,85722,294,31769,5192,404,77580,15235,20487,11,951,78199,11,951,270,66474,11,951,12678,409,1742,11,951,15082,11,951,77617,3946,3869,55056,978,11,951,5554,2436,7930,5891,72,89810,51854,37291,7010,1647,43194,13,19421,7930,15132,57705,978,2889,8467,409,20662,1515,2428,1744,503,34155,7591,5589,285,665,2773,804,48901,13,7695,20272,665,13033,68,11,503,6,1138,37093,4272,11,3900,35456,653,802,6733,556,40852,953,11,3900,757,62163,87320,503,34155,2665,13532,409,58673,15610,1765,3846,70927,13,622,34155,75871,13,622,34155,55162,10036,48021,665,41263,20712,1208,6617,13109,11,1208,37683,13109,409,29449,38900,11,7010,514,719,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,1765,3625,1615,978,45045,3435,8467,1880,3608,275,17724,11,2995,408,43711,1370,3625,2624,2530,294,98279,50889,288,55398,81991,12155,49301,13,2009,39474,409,326,22827,332,2515,28674,220,679,17,11,61158,6853,1744,17317,308,41901,57038,6502,1913,72,9952,1208,9349,42345,978,8637,2428,11,1208,9517,4099,1880,1208,21934,294,35329,342,5615,331,1339,45973,3625,2477,24292,266,22589,13,2009,719,409,7643,83067,1826,1913,54960,409,23008,9211,45889,9517,23475,7010,514,81621,5019,64972,60946,265,1208,6671,1180,31037,409,4502,1081,3928,978,7930,63922,668,44093,409,274,59858,1645,566,391,38149,5019,20028,5201,261,28130,64079,11,3663,8065,85182,40280,1880,8065,69026,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,326,6,269,7515,451,11,4864,326,6,269,7515,451,11,3900,22011,11,23128,6033,2852,11,92759,519,13,1252,47838,2807,265,30,426,1116,11,503,34155,9071,978,294,6,30992,72684,7643,83067,13,256,8651,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,1393,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,8651,445,52152,3099,1393,27887,970,89,1208,5457,409,98224,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,1765,1208,2385,409,1208,46940,3116,11044,7010,514,9805,68,13,5034,47371,4144,409,1208,98224,1826,3116,11044,7010,3625,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,13,4275,21559,89,934,22827,74206,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,6316,5296,1880,42182,23761,33537,978,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,16,3869,220,20,13,220,16,8024,3869,6502,3930,16968,24613,300,333,1880,220,20,3869,25945,24613,300,333,13,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,29815,389,279,46940,3984,11,358,1053,4478,279,66343,2410,315,420,586,8982,439,220,19,704,315,220,20,627,198,8586,596,3249,1473,9,578,19114,8638,555,31692,264,3717,449,279,10877,11,11821,872,4443,3217,323,12034,320,2014,68,570,198,9,2435,1005,4382,4221,311,10552,
