This might make it challenging for some listeners to follow along, potentially diluting the persuasive impact.\n\nOverall, however, I think the speaker makes a compelling case and effectively conveys their enthusiasm for their topic.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,1393,9805,68,1393,220,622,41901,16796,9395,978,39929,6316,36252,26626,74260,285,68636,6033,38920,50750,1295,1732,64829,6033,30179,6960,89,87810,13,423,59858,18757,4365,1647,10045,10071,16968,3846,1744,503,6,434,61055,20662,2217,13,19421,4864,36731,9038,2428,1744,514,2835,2447,12844,34501,818,4495,1133,66021,1744,43905,326,6,391,652,978,71,2711,2109,974,21273,355,13,4418,66,20662,2217,11,4864,91507,9189,3625,3327,72684,665,56321,3585,13,19421,4502,4864,757,7591,65,583,4618,14707,11,1208,1913,9189,60946,3625,87320,3846,71139,6502,653,3197,409,12366,13,3206,21134,1486,272,17771,1647,31260,13,24971,653,31260,8065,6225,64441,11,66090,25500,11,272,17771,409,3846,1765,13,1252,31260,8065,6225,31260,294,57286,29246,13,3206,31260,272,17771,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,13,2009,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,272,17771,653,98947,13,356,17771,653,40126,409,3585,1880,409,83199,9465,27750,3585,11,951,326,6,3342,329,17724,1880,951,48924,39863,98151,462,14295,13,80905,71357,13,19421,79071,14896,409,5636,11,79071,14896,7930,665,20272,653,31260,92759,519,1826,8791,458,5019,56321,8261,1370,46415,1370,51173,13,24703,934,54386,917,6853,653,7434,24429,97496,665,3703,266,1354,16036,380,8467,4502,9189,55162,41881,653,28800,1437,404,978,665,77824,13,13789,11,503,34155,653,31260,294,57286,29246,13,43987,26178,11,3900,757,47090,653,60697,13,24703,60697,513,15132,3625,34684,16036,288,41958,3675,13,1708,1105,934,17771,54312,1744,272,17771,653,7434,39723,9189,45366,3057,9211,25945,51794,479,13,423,6,52009,1759,1744,9189,47592,26725,665,83067,1744,3930,46110,14458,7930,43989,326,6,332,12416,55398,6,2933,6800,12366,17855,11,12366,308,17771,6502,44093,24560,1208,27584,1880,1208,57128,294,31109,39973,2349,13,12623,83457,1744,514,1080,12844,951,53542,834,1339,15265,326,12339,13,19421,4864,757,326,34155,14175,285,294,6,1662,2743,25692,85815,28463,83457,1744,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,13,3341,1765,3625,46106,1206,1154,78511,14295,41958,3675,11,3900,264,6316,87810,81621,11,6316,59471,30179,6960,1880,25692,85815,6316,52087,8047,3938,13,24703,1744,503,6,2706,81356,11,272,17771,514,51136,261,3869,1208,85722,9952,1208,88265,1208,57128,409,1208,39973,2349,25692,85815,25400,71751,6316,38920,2035,7010,3625,14240,29246,78810,33903,8065,81337,409,98947,409,7710,1370,51173,11,6033,409,1208,48364,42914,13,16770,7970,11,503,34155,653,31260,13,622,34155,653,60697,11,74699,3900,47090,653,80259,13,2998,69,1607,306,11,272,17771,6316,51651,14896,11,272,17771,2307,13,356,17771,6316,52088,978,8637,2428,7330,52760,13,14465,36731,1685,593,1765,665,39929,13,7695,1826,31605,978,409,26633,78199,81186,13,7695,17317,3288,11,71151,42587,8047,11,8811,13550,285,11,39973,1880,60538,6960,13,1708,1105,87320,1208,17536,60538,6960,43989,12,6853,71151,51744,447,8047,9952,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,30,4366,346,1744,272,17771,653,7434,409,1206,978,11866,2428,11,653,35462,887,63497,78810,467,13,4418,66,11,3900,379,264,653,348,3023,14687,1744,9189,12584,89,12602,1765,46777,3190,24812,324,13,41621,934,54386,264,653,98947,57485,7010,43905,1208,39973,13,15663,1771,348,3023,969,1188,14240,408,265,3738,288,9875,409,1208,39973,5019,4046,49272,261,5636,60538,336,479,13,356,17771,83195,1744,9964,439,4647,635,60946,265,39043,13,12535,1826,54312,1744,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,1826,908,978,10253,34684,1370,13532,15564,30,19421,4068,1826,54312,934,35329,25692,19477,52750,6316,39973,60538,6960,4502,653,19227,7434,29253,30,13789,11,3900,757,66167,653,28800,409,27138,13,64105,64,264,653,28800,409,9189,3327,76366,87320,3846,1879,295,6502,653,3197,409,41958,13,3341,22299,7010,514,84850,4558,21152,57234,11,272,17771,6316,91678,367,3930,3197,409,41958,13,2100,333,7930,274,59858,11,514,1069,396,265,11,3846,308,17771,6502,653,23496,84,13,2009,1069,396,265,49733,11,272,17771,1647,46110,523,283,11,514,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,13,42215,264,31632,409,1208,10512,648,3869,21273,10670,514,3197,409,41958,1370,39587,13,19421,3930,16081,25400,264,33537,978,829,57128,13,19421,272,17771,653,1879,68,11,503,6,2706,81356,1744,9189,5945,1055,10333,3930,98947,951,1206,14081,1154,78511,14295,13,9605,14896,1744,1826,6316,52087,8047,1370,682,4558,3869,1208,57128,409,1208,39973,13,256,8651,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,1393,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,8651,445,52152,3099,1393,27887,970,89,1208,5457,409,98224,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,1765,1208,2385,409,1208,46940,3116,11044,7010,514,9805,68,13,5034,47371,4144,409,1208,98224,1826,3116,11044,7010,3625,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,13,4275,21559,89,934,22827,74206,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,6316,5296,1880,42182,23761,33537,978,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,16,3869,220,20,13,220,16,8024,3869,6502,3930,
