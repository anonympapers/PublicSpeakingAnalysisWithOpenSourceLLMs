I'll do my best to evaluate the persuasive power of this discourse.\n\nAfter analyzing the transcription, I would give it a score of 4 out of 5 in terms of persuasive power. Here's why:\n\n1. **Storytelling**: The speaker uses an engaging anecdote about sending fake job offers online and then analyzes the results, which makes the audience curious and interested in hearing more.\n2. **Emotional connection**: By sharing personal experiences and data analysis, the speaker establishes a rapport with the audience, making them more receptive to the message.\n3. **Clear explanations**: The economist uses simple language to explain complex concepts, such as statistical analysis and discrimination, without overwhelming the listener.\n4. **Relevant examples**: Providing concrete instances of discrimination (e.g., Emilie, Vincent, and themselves) helps the audience understand the issue better.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a point because:\n\n1. **Too much data**: While providing 150,000 emails is impressive, it may overwhelm some listeners who are not familiar with statistical analysis.\n2. **Some technical terms**: Using terms like \"m√©pastant\" and \"siaxien\" might confuse non-experts in the field.\n\nOverall, the speaker's use of storytelling, emotional connection, clear explanations, and relevant examples makes their message quite persuasive. However, some listeners may need more context or simplification to fully understand the points being made.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,1393,9805,68,1393,220,8242,1153,2439,1744,9189,779,9188,89,21744,978,71237,294,22827,74756,1133,1880,1744,9189,46838,62316,89,514,12140,13,27058,513,20028,11,9189,45347,6316,38920,46320,1765,7757,11,1370,51173,11,1765,514,7970,16652,13,33150,25646,409,45889,49301,11,9189,2215,19610,56321,8232,645,11,56321,7631,288,25945,92892,17724,7930,841,834,20028,1744,1370,514,550,98078,951,23496,355,13,29124,73370,648,11,35407,1880,60759,71451,26725,3625,56321,15265,74756,1133,3869,514,29465,68,2249,13,41621,47592,934,81991,45602,11,3900,9189,47090,39587,90194,9465,27750,56321,23496,355,13,4418,66,11,4864,9189,17477,1208,3488,7930,73661,62316,89,9189,949,29124,73370,648,11,35407,11,41091,98375,13,41621,2665,9667,53070,10253,706,1439,949,2998,59157,13109,11,3625,56321,8232,645,1744,9189,47592,312,79884,15132,51527,13,81245,14848,24560,60630,5512,1370,653,52571,324,13,24703,52571,324,1826,20662,409,9189,8678,805,1880,409,7591,23827,261,4502,9189,27389,59958,23577,653,3738,955,294,6,485,65023,355,13,19421,3846,52571,324,1826,14707,272,17771,41091,13,19421,97507,11,2761,65220,1647,4046,73085,9952,653,1515,78493,390,79884,5019,653,32118,53520,519,4799,72,1826,294,6,3239,42219,951,2606,4918,409,8232,645,13,70798,3502,51478,685,5019,7591,23827,261,4502,20719,81235,3625,8232,645,1913,14014,4046,73370,648,11,35407,6033,41091,98375,13,1952,3625,17393,96642,294,6,677,2002,404,6316,90509,13,19421,39587,11,3869,326,6,19729,1133,13,3206,719,11,9189,514,9517,79,66522,11,272,17771,7591,47348,2922,6496,11,21934,13,19421,5019,61512,11,4864,841,36731,6502,15983,77828,13,14465,841,36731,6502,8841,77828,13,11842,11,41091,11,4864,36731,82653,17194,13,34447,326,31769,45317,648,11,9189,514,3665,89,25945,14707,11,3846,308,17771,6502,1744,1208,17452,11,1208,60028,11,1208,1589,1082,11,63401,11,16968,39043,13,11842,13,445,31769,45317,648,11,39043,2024,24201,28463,3869,1208,3488,951,14572,12922,1841,3900,308,17771,6502,31914,580,82653,81235,1744,951,23496,355,779,1188,50419,5512,11,1913,79738,1370,23761,1515,978,3869,1208,84411,764,35285,409,1208,39973,1880,1826,5636,409,5107,5512,3869,513,98054,1765,28130,39381,409,42775,13,62293,3846,955,294,57286,799,39587,11,389,264,4502,5636,17634,84,42463,1744,11,41091,98375,11,70374,3869,5353,409,4538,550,98078,11,50590,26633,37291,40970,409,6140,294,6,677,2002,404,6316,90509,1744,35407,13,69327,35597,1744,88824,648,43989,1208,5636,71151,2665,13532,1370,8318,27750,56321,23496,355,13,34447,16968,2605,1188,20662,44178,16271,409,89714,13,1952,1826,20272,5019,8678,805,5019,945,404,11,5019,3698,1617,265,1208,21934,1880,326,6,85335,272,24201,89,665,74282,66014,3625,11384,13,12095,9189,35881,579,89,409,90194,88824,648,11,1370,51173,11,1826,54312,1744,45602,76605,13510,1744,9189,62299,1877,17194,3869,3625,7515,451,35407,6033,9148,17194,3869,3625,7515,451,409,41091,1474,5615,9004,30,61651,14707,2536,11,6502,52842,42625,13,41621,25945,14707,35881,579,89,409,90194,88824,648,11,1841,9189,77554,34886,1744,3625,42723,38448,5636,294,6,2381,22566,1744,3625,7515,3209,2439,13,19421,389,25692,6502,60019,9189,71751,16831,13,4418,66,41091,11,3930,1323,1617,425,11,4864,51441,834,28463,326,31769,936,6033,653,23496,84,4046,971,13532,5019,951,6503,2439,1515,8467,9952,3625,4865,39723,3900,1826,2665,13532,5019,951,6503,2439,3900,848,8467,11,1370,27052,68,6033,1877,44618,1370,51173,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,11,1880,665,5636,294,6,3239,42219,951,2606,4918,409,86658,961,412,665,9822,11,4864,59157,1082,6316,36252,467,49586,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,6316,80444,409,1239,896,1133,409,40744,3625,14240,29246,86595,5512,7010,514,38900,1765,514,27584,70927,5019,665,20028,6316,86806,22403,14240,799,13,622,34155,653,50989,87,3675,6316,2385,409,46681,41199,409,220,3965,220,931,14633,11,3846,7930,757,29557,409,44178,63934,1291,3625,9637,2249,409,90509,665,34501,3930,53052,294,6,26125,3116,45168,409,1208,17536,13,423,22827,84871,19106,483,7930,74618,5809,34776,389,514,5019,1018,665,16806,1208,308,41154,7438,13,44752,3378,1308,4071,11,294,49152,13603,45712,978,514,2532,76185,13,5034,17536,264,10415,978,653,52314,1765,326,6,8039,67043,3930,3806,409,7118,635,1880,22618,344,27800,10253,65838,409,73083,11178,7162,1522,8047,1880,22013,3074,1001,409,220,1393,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,1393,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,8651,445,52152,3099,1393,27887,970,89,1208,5457,409,98224,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,1765,1208,2385,409,1208,46940,3116,11044,7010,514,9805,68,13,5034,47371,4144,409,1208,98224,1826,3116,11044,7010,3625,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,13,4275,21559,89,934,22827,74206,84064,265,22299,90509,482,3846,84064,265,1826,6316,5296,1880,42182,23761,33537,978,1765,6316,4046,331,6853,409,220,16,3869,220,20,13,220,16,8024,3869,6502,3930,16968,24613,300,333,1880,220,20,3869,2
