After analyzing the transcription, I would give a persuasion score of **4** out of 5.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The speaker starts with an engaging example from everyday life (the \"cuillère d'argent\" phrase) that helps to illustrate the concept.\n* They then clearly explain the experiment they conducted on young monks, making it easy to follow and understand the results.\n* The speaker provides a logical connection between the experiment's findings and the initial statement about the \"cuillère d'argent,\" showing how their research supports or contradicts the idea.\n* The use of specific numbers and data (e.g., barbe length, number of offspring) adds credibility to the study and helps to build trust with the audience.\n* The speaker's tone is conversational and non-confrontational, making it easy for the listener to follow along.\n\nThe only aspect that prevents me from giving a perfect score of 5 out of 5 is that the text could benefit from some minor adjustments in terms of sentence structure and clarity. However, overall, the speaker presents their argument in a clear, concise, and convincing manner, making it an effective persuasive piece.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,1393,9805,68,1393,220,64105,64,20272,9189,3846,1744,1879,57609,326,6,29199,11,308,93825,9952,6316,7015,12339,294,6,77217,7010,1208,30870,1557,949,46408,97583,265,514,20272,934,22827,23496,84,11,49733,294,31109,67628,436,12333,11,40142,16968,3846,7930,25400,47090,5019,59394,653,11049,295,1370,7010,1208,17536,13,7695,35737,15878,85624,294,2182,653,56430,72006,11,6800,11,12108,11,10071,76776,665,7245,483,77323,13,34447,26077,1826,514,55520,9465,20662,87810,409,7015,484,12339,1880,3625,4647,1572,61852,8467,949,19421,14707,11,272,17771,16968,326,6,526,1994,386,988,68,11,7591,23827,978,4502,46206,3625,4647,1572,17317,28463,11,76076,23496,355,56311,308,93825,9952,6316,7015,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,293,20243,13,1708,1105,11,4068,25692,10539,7591,5589,404,6316,7015,12339,294,6,77217,5019,653,17258,784,519,409,4647,1572,17317,949,27058,653,17258,784,519,829,275,11,951,6699,6666,77,5512,11,7930,73661,79738,653,1689,991,16491,5019,20028,28130,13080,3869,326,6,370,462,951,27389,1045,1759,11,10071,272,17771,28463,653,72006,13612,321,11,653,14464,2850,523,438,27080,68,1880,409,4160,58504,653,6502,21965,1437,4168,519,13,445,1105,593,326,22827,409,27750,33013,98942,4046,1543,447,1821,11,1370,51173,11,1208,5103,6853,308,17771,6502,35597,22150,409,4538,39646,3904,1880,514,8811,13,19421,21965,10366,978,3869,15907,294,1759,294,81979,5103,37907,11,3625,17258,784,1821,15132,3625,274,5512,44711,8467,13,362,1208,16888,72,951,27389,1045,1759,1880,3869,1208,67628,11,1880,45602,2605,61652,653,8631,46206,3625,17258,784,1821,13,19421,514,8631,11,9189,665,5804,72,408,23577,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,7970,5019,1208,77323,13,622,34155,9964,22011,39587,5636,51625,285,42625,4068,3846,8631,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,20662,63070,768,409,7015,12339,294,6,77217,11,85434,3869,1208,77323,951,17258,784,1821,13,27058,45602,11,17317,57038,4046,3532,5512,951,17258,784,1821,409,296,2003,78,13,81245,14848,24560,9517,4581,552,665,26633,1912,288,294,6,21843,69898,13,11876,17258,784,1821,3930,21134,57951,14848,312,79884,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,15921,5512,9952,6316,36908,409,8631,25945,9517,79,438,361,46206,3625,297,1082,12249,11,1208,23100,292,33574,13,356,8458,264,14175,285,294,6,19729,479,261,28130,53052,409,8631,14843,285,519,44351,3846,7930,513,39904,5019,653,17258,784,519,1880,23464,8047,15878,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,13,11876,17258,784,1821,3930,2132,57951,14848,42676,77818,2249,924,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,7138,4835,13,81245,14848,39587,24560,4046,3532,5512,7010,951,4787,887,14014,3869,326,83508,11,15878,8631,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,11,9952,6316,7015,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,293,20243,13,39783,37291,409,7287,56430,11,503,34155,14240,21178,978,4068,514,20272,294,49152,13603,24560,47371,3372,69068,6033,2536,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,11,100196,1765,28130,9504,344,13109,1877,31037,1880,28130,23878,13109,3869,409,43406,409,82134,6699,13,1708,1105,11,4068,20272,10539,5019,47929,4502,653,46415,29466,72,61020,949,432,3675,409,5636,4382,11,3625,8811,1474,84,3444,2249,30179,812,9964,841,3703,1395,13,19421,22299,46206,3625,2854,1771,11,3625,3703,10551,15132,77554,14081,5512,22299,3625,5636,1877,285,13,622,34155,39587,757,355,324,978,1208,1317,79623,409,27750,3703,9620,1880,503,34155,5363,978,7930,11,951,46415,29466,285,409,12155,26633,1912,288,11,50590,3625,5636,38546,13,27058,4046,838,8977,3625,20697,21237,2748,3916,409,11083,46415,29466,285,11,503,34155,55056,978,514,13026,409,86696,934,85217,2558,10994,1188,10878,519,6316,76132,44351,1744,1208,62827,1880,514,97418,409,15907,17258,784,1821,13,19421,8065,1620,11,934,17771,54312,1744,39043,264,33537,978,949,622,34155,9466,978,1744,3625,46415,29466,285,7930,84764,1188,951,3703,9620,5636,98385,1880,7930,308,49152,1339,39587,1131,11876,46415,29466,285,7930,308,6,2979,1188,6502,312,79884,409,7015,404,294,6,77217,7010,514,293,20243,11,503,34155,17634,28130,14425,24918,11,50590,951,3703,9620,5636,98385,11,39587,46152,97958,40970,1877,8467,409,28130,1391,12339,13,27058,61512,11,1880,272,17771,39015,11,3869,65285,266,25945,92759,519,11,8811,90966,514,20272,934,85217,97958,40970,409,17393,409,2605,78,16339,653,16081,409,1080,12844,46206,6316,5103,6853,11,87158,3846,66090,63484,513,54206,11,46152,82133,2558,556,951,17258,784,1821,5636,25500,1880,665,5636,6800,13026,1744,28130,1391,13559,13,362,32384,11,6502,63669,409,7015,404,294,6,77217,5019,409,43406,653,7970,312,3107,12844,13,256,8651,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,8047,1393,73053,15265,55847,11,26077,1826,514,409,90966,409,98224,3930,2624,2530,7010,20662,46940,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,54613,9517,67,7404,31914,6480,653,1984,5804,467,66363,949,12103,6503,91080,1826,57375,13552,80284,2249,949,8651,445,52152,3099,1393,27887,970,89,1208,5457,409,98224,409,1208,5178,6814,37526,1765,1208,2385,409,1208,46940,3116,11044,7010,514,9805,68,13,5034,47371,4144,409,1208,98224,1826,3116,11044,7010,3625,4418,77,14014,423,6,24677,804
